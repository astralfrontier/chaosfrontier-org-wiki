# Gods of Eden 2005-04-22

Egress uses her time making contacts. Much like Rumika the year before, Egress makes no real attempt to hide herself. She seeks Solars and spirits, and she can hardly inspire confidence if she herself is afraid. She makes a point of keeping Rain of Fire with her. Partially for the symbol of unity with spirits that she desires, but just as much for the aid in bridging the gap in desires between Solar and spirit. Egress does not show a great interest in the powerful, this time. She is seeking the weak, the threatened, and those who have a need for her. Her people now far safer than they had been, it is time to consider the spirits in and about her realm. And those beyond her borders, as well.

Once mingling among the Gods and Chosen, Chi-Yosh spots two beings who strike his memory. A description long ago by Gallius and Marina of two spirits who related a tale of being expelled from Thorns, and helped by a Dawn to rekindle their lives once more. The duo are still in Melevhil, but have become noted deities within Melevhil, a small trading outpost along the Greater Rock. The woman, spun of glass filled with the earthy glow of water, reminds the Dawn that they were overjoyed when hearing about the growth of the Nation, and are glad to be a part of it, and would still enjoy a visit from one of the Circle soon. Chi-Yosh would go on, but the spirits are snagged up in a merry rekindling with an old friend from Thorns.

Egress has only a few specific concerns beyond her general socializing. She seeks a Lunar who she never seems to be fated to have to deal with. When she finds Ma-Ha-Suchi, she wastes as little time as ever. "Enjoying the festivities?" she murmurs, smirking. She doesn't really wait for any answer to such a pointless question. "The plan is finally in motion, but those people from across the sea might break a lot of teeth before the jaws crush the life from them." She looks about, making sure none are too close, though she also lowers her voice, "I know nothing of sea battles, but this will be a naval fight."

"The naval engagements will leash the dogs," is the elder Lunar's answer. "They must still then be put down on their own turf."

"There is one that we all know of, a pillar of the Silver Pact who was never outmatched, and above all, he was master of the waves. But will he see in us a worthwhile cause?" asks Egress. "And yes, their own turf is where the battle must go, but we must shatter their hold on the world. And we must have enough power to strike them from many sides. I have no warships worthy of attacking them. Do you? And even if I did, I would not know how to use them properly."

A gleam appears in the eye of Ma-Ha-Suchi. "You're brave, to speak of even asking that one for a favor. The Pact has thought to approach him. Come to me, and we'll go together at the right time."

"I do not know if it is bravery or foolish idealism, yet my heart demands it," replies Egress. "I will seek him when the time is right. I will because he is greater than I and Creation needs him. I have spoken with him before. Perhaps he will not mind hearing my words once more."

Gilthane of Coral is enjoying the sights and sounds of Yu-Shan. He seems a stranger to the place, although he retains a great deal of composure in the face of the awe-inspiring Celestial city. His retinue accompanies him, and murmurs arise from this throng as the Solar Circle approaches to speak to him. "Hello, my friends," he says in languid greeting, as he smiles and turns to receive the group.

Davron bows slightly, yet graciously. "Greetings to you, friend. You spoke of yourself at the conclave of the Solars, claiming a... perilous heritage. May we have a moment of your time to discuss this matter in greater detail?"

"My time is yours," Gil replies. Some unspoken message passes between himself and his retainers; all but one depart. "Speak," he says, after a time.

"We thank you for your time, Gilthane," replies Ramar as he looks around carefully, then turns his attention to the other Eclipse. "Well... I suppose the first question I'd like to see answered is how you discovered that you had the... heritage you have discovered you have? And after that... there'd be questions as to what, if anything, you can remember from that particular bearer..."

"A predictable opening question. The one leads to the other," Gil answers with a casual smile. "I know because I have memories that can be from no other entity. I've used those memories to good effect."

"Knowledge is power," agrees Davron. "But you are not the only one beset by the agents of Oblivion." He smiles wryly. "To ask the next predictable question: Is there anything of value that you could share with us, or with others - for the sake of all Creation? How should we, or Mei-Bo, or any others, deal with the rulers of the shadowlands on our doorstep? We already know," he says, glancing at Egress, "that open conflict with them is a deadly peril."

Gil laughs a little. "I heard about that," he replies with a gallant bow to Egress. "I'm glad that milady survived, after a fashion." Returning his attention to Davron, he speaks more seriously. "I am told that your Circle commands a book containing lost sorcery, a topic I'm interested in. I can't simply give away what I know without endangering the ah, arrangement I have. I need assurance that I'll get something worth losing that."

"Of course," answers Ramar. "After all, we would expect the same... However, this is neither the time, nor the place for such discussions. If we could, by your leave, arrange to meet later... in a safer location-one which you are familiar with and trust-I think that we can answer each others ah... various questions. Is this acceptable?"

"Of course." Gil smiles. "Visit Coral. Everybody knows me there."

Mai Bo is doing much the same thing Egress has been working on - building a coalition of support among the Celestial Exalted and spirits in attendance at the Carnival of Masks. It seems she has discovered the secret to the masks that give the Carnival its name, for the Circle witnesses her distributing two to her fellow Chosen.

Chi-Yosh lingers just out of the way as Mai Bo finishes up a conversation with a god. He would have addressed one of her Circle, but it was she that spoke up during the meeting, and thus she deserves to be addressed. "You are Mai Bo of An-Teng?" inquires the Dawn as he swoops in before her attention diverts elsewhere. "I am Chi-Yosh of the Su'Katan. I noticed you have been collecting masks of the little gods. What is the secret to the masks?"

"Shalindra of Nexus, the Mask-Maker," the sorceress replies, glancing at Chi-Yosh and appraising him coolly. "I had her craft several for me as gifts to give."

Chi-Yosh knows that name. He had intended to seek out Shalindra, but never made the trip to Nexus. "Ah. Thank you. However, I come to you for another matter." His voice drops, along with all pretense of casual conversation. "The First and Forsaken Lion. You and your people seek to dismantle him. My Circle can assist you, if you assist us."

Mai Bo's eyes narrow speculatively. "You have my interest," she murmurs. "In what way can I help?"

Chi-Yosh looks out over the milling crowds. "The Solars have come tonight with the interests of their Circles, seeking to further their own reach. How many have come seeking to further the reach of the Chosen of the Sun?" Turning back to her, "You can help us, by joining us. We are creating a council. A rekindling of the Solar Deliberative. If you come, speak to us, join us in our cause, we can give you some new tools for your battles."

"What advantage is there in such a body?" asks Mai Bo. "Do you command troops and wealth, or is this an organization with only a name?"

"The resources of the Nation of the Sun and the Solars who lead it are what we bring to the Solar Deliberative," replies the Dawn. "It is a collection of what every member can do, and use. Not only their power, but the power of knowledge itself."

"Pretty words," Mai Bo says, half-sneering. "You have your corner of the rich Eastern Threshold. I seem to recall you have a book of magic - that I might find interesting. But if your Deliberative does not tax my own resources too greatly, I will not reject your offer."

"I've got the cooperation of a dozen Solars or more," Mai Bo continues, watching faces warily as she speaks. "Some have spoken about you. If the stories they tell are true, I'll join. And my allies will join with me. Now.. will there be anything else?"

"Nothing more. Only to say that we have the strength to back up the claim of rekindling the Solar Deliberative." The Dawn gives a simple bow to Mai Bo. "Thank you for your consideration."

Dace and Panther, two of the Solars who have been working with the Circle, are now joined by more allies. A pretty but shy librarian named Arianna, a confident and beautiful archer named Harmonious Jade, and a wandering schemer named Swan have all recognized each other as once-members of a Circle. Their past lives draw them together here in Yu-Shan, and all are willing to aid the Nation in its efforts.

And with Swan is another new ally - Lilith, an ancient Lunar, one who has strayed far from the Silver Pact's attention in her time in Creation. She, too, has a connection to Swan from the First Age, although unlike him she has lived continuously since that time. Although she is a Lunar, she is as uncomfortable with mankind as she is with its civilization, and so in a twist of irony she is more amenable to aiding the Nation than most other Chosen of the Moon.

And here at the Carnival there are three more allies who wish to support the Nation. All are deceased.

Blood on Snow, the Abyssal ambassador, has used his newfound freedom and his disturbing powers of vocal hypnosis to learn the secrets of some of the great heroes of the Scavenger Lands. Naya the Blade, Riverborne Petal, and Sir Ganesh were warriors, generals, and leaders in the times that the Realm attacked the Scavenger Lands in its overly ambitious bid to conquer the East. These three ghosts became powerful spirits in their own right, and they now attend the Carnival in Yu-Shan to seek out the Nation's representatives and join with them. Each informs Egress that Blood on Snow has arranged for their needs and that consequently they are free to help.

Now that those who are willing, and only those who are willing, have come to listen to what has to be said, Egress will speak. With her usual calm, she addresses the gathered Solars.

"Cousins," she begins warmly, "I thank you for taking the time from these celebrations to hear me out. I will not take long. As we all know, we were selected for a specific reason. Some of us are warriors, some are great workers of magic, and some are able to sway the masses. Yet none of us were made to stand utterly alone."

Egress looks from face to face. Many names she knows now. She knows because she sought them out earlier. Not the strongest. They do not need what she offers as much as the others. They are less likely to see safety itself as an asset. "Some of you know of my circle. Some of you I have spoken with. We wish to see a Celestial Order rise again. It is why we exist."

"We are not alone. Yet so many of us live as if we were. We fight battles alone, and remain distant, divided. We are growing stronger, but we stand at a critical junction and our enemies are taking notice of our power. They know our secrets far better than any of us would wish. Perhaps better than we have yet imagined." Egress lets those words sink in only for a short time. She has more. "If they feel we are too strong, they will destroy us. I trust all here are wise enough to not believe they are beyond the reach of the Deathlords. I assure you, it is better to simply accept this than request tutelage at their very capable hands." She laughs softly, her own injury turning into a jest.

"I call you here because the hope for our survival comes in alliance. I have a suggestion. I am just a Solar, a ruler like many of you have become. No more do I wish, but I cannot sit in my borders and believe that I will be left alone. That time is gone, if indeed it ever existed. We must come together," says Egress. "Or all of us will be swept away. In the travels of my Circle, we have found a potential meeting place. A city that has much to offer. I propose we use it to serve as a neutral ground where Celestials and other interested parties may come to make treaties. I imagine many here know of the city of Denandsor."

Seeing in the eyes of those watching a positive reaction, and hearing an interested buzz as well, Egress continues. "I speak of an alliance, but we must start slowly. We have a common enemy, but to move against them openly now will lead to death. I know it very well. We will start by facing the challenges of reclaiming an ancient city. We will be able to learn about each other as we do this. When we succeed--and I have no doubt we shall--we will reap the benefits together."

"You can't," calls a voice from the assembled group. "The geomancy is wrong. You'd have to redesign the whole city's power system."

"Do you really doubt the ability of those gathered here to achieve that?" asks Egress. "Do you really think that if we work together that anything is truly impossible? If it were an easy task, I would not suggest we face it together. This is a worthy task. It is something we all can benefit from. Learning how to fix that system will give us the key to making it work. If we learn to make it work, perhaps we can make more like it elsewhere."

The speaker steps forward. It is a young man wearing spectacles and the robes of a Scavenger Lord. "Ivory is my name," he calls with the studied assurance of a savant. "Listen. You can't just move the city, like I'm sure you're thinking. You're going to have to change the dragon lines back to the way they were some, oh, thousand or more years ago. You're going to have to blow up Manses. Reshape mountains. Do you think the people in the region are just going to sit by?"

The discussion derails itself for almost two minutes, as Davron steps forward and begins speaking with the confident young man. "Finalan's Law states..." and ".. the sidelong sub-terran conjunction.." and similar phrases flow between them, and the others gathered here marvel. Finally the discussion is cut short, and the two are reminded of time. "Well, it can be done," concedes the savant at last. "But you'll never do it without making a lot of friends around Denandsor and paying them off, no matter WHAT you do."

"We will hardly try to cheat those who shall be our new neighbors," says Egress wryly. "And some of us are fairly skilled at making new friends. Now, if you gentlemen are done debating for a moment how it is to be done, can we all agree that it should at least be attempted?" She looks to those gathered, curious what the final reaction shall be.

The result, when it comes, stuns even Egress. There is a booming of support, even from those who are not entirely sure what their contribution shall be. As has been the case many times, the power of Helios shines through those who do his will, and that can only be the case here as all those listening are energized. Many of those gathered who started skeptical now flock those of the Nation's circle, asking for suggestions of how they might help, what tasks they might do. Davron and Ivory find themselves swarmed with others who have suggestions of how it might be done, and Davron is cornered by several who wish to know what books he has read and what wonders he has studied to gain such knowledge. No one is spared attention, as the performance reflects positively upon the talents of the entire Circle.

Chejop Kejak, the Steersman, has called a meeting of the luminaries of the Celestial Exalted. This includes the Solar Circle, along with several high-ranking Lunars. Together in a vast ampitheater, screened by rings of guards and wards, this august group of Exalted hear the pronouncements of the dozen or so Sidereals gathered here.

"We have conducted the Second Prophecy," he announces, showing the strain that the great work has put upon him. "Once again, the world is in peril. Once again, we are called to stop it. And once again, the outcome is grave."

"Some of you are bitter about the Wyld Hunt, the purge of the Solars and Lunars that the Realm instituted under our direction. My advice to you is - get over it." This incites several grows from the Lunar contingent, and tightenings of fists from the Solars, but Kejak continues unabated. "The Silver Pact can certainly have no issue with culling the weak of the herd. Don't come simpering to me when someone does it to you in return. As to the Solars, well... you've been a disorganized mob since the Shogunate. Look at you. Just now agreeing to get together and have some coherent direction, at last."

Davron mutters under his breath, "I rather think we did pretty well, considering." But he doesn't see fit to challenge the Steersman now, at least not on that point - if Kejak is right, and the Second Prophecy shows the world to be in danger once more, further strife amongst the Celestial Exalted would only hasten that doom. The debate about the merits of the Wyld Hunt can be conducted later - by those who survive.

"You are right. We are called to stop it," murmurs Ramar. The old Sidereal's words sink in carefully, each one weighted just so. It becomes easy to see how the Prophecy so far has indeed be right, however... _theirs is not necessarily the only outcome_. What has happened in the past is important, but it must not overshadow what is to come. Especially if what the Steersman has perceived is a grave peril indeed.

"The Second Prophecy outlined three fates."

"In one future, the world and everything in it will die. The Neverborn destroy the powers in Creation, conquer the Realm, and fulfill their ambition to end all life in existence."

"In another, the Celestial Exalted are corrupted and enslaved - perhaps snared by the Deathlords, twisted by the Yozis, or poured into the soul-molds of the Others Beyond. Whoever or whatever the instrument of their transformation, it is clear that they will destroy each other."

"In the final future, the Celestial Exalted abandon Creation entirely. Where they go is beyond the ability of any prophecy to foretell, but it is known that they go to war."

Chi-Yosh passes looks among his Circlemates. It was they who had pushed the Steersman to observe the prophecy once more, and in a way, it is their doing that has led to this proclamation of such dire fate. These prophecies hold no suggestion why the Celestial Exalt must fight eachother - to prolong and reduce the chances of the first two fates from happening, jointed efforts from all would be the best solution. But the last...

Egress frowns thoughtfully. Those futures hardly sound promising. If anything, these hold even less hope than the original prophecy did. She asks then, "Steersman, is there any way we can determine how the influence of the Deathlords will effect these futures? Or even how it will effect the prophecy itself? These results are not what any of us desire. The question is, does this mean we must strike at the Deathlords now, or are we wiser to wait? Or is it simply impossible to know?"

"We have an answer to that," answers another Sidereal, dressed all in black, and with the lower half of his face covered. His voice is a chilling cold, and as he speaks the Solars suddenly become aware of the aura of death that touches him. "I have concluded my researches. The story of the Council of Entities is true. The Deathlords are vulnerable to their true names."

The words of the prophecy sink in. Ramar at first does not want to believe it could be possible... and yet, prophecy and destiny have a way of working themselves out, due more to who you are, than what it is you do. Things can change, there is a madness inside them which may even affect these prophecies... if this were to be cured... Ramar looks up as the Chosen of Saturn concludes his research. "Their true names?" he asks, "You mean, their names before they became... what they are now?"

"Just so," replies the spectral Celestial. "Their names as the Solar Exalted of another age. Your doomed forerunners. Just as you are doomed now."

"Just as we are all doomed," replies Egress softly. "I have spoken with the Deathlord Mask of Winters, and faced him in a game of Truth." She imagines the Steersman knows that game very well. "He told me that he had no memory of ever being a Solar. He also told me that the Council of Entities is composed of ghosts, mortals, and a kush ya tet, an agent of the Yozis. This information may be of some use, and if you have more questions you would seek to ask of a Deathlord, I will seek another out and challenge them to the game once more. I will do my part in preventing this prophecy from destroying Creation."

The Steersman chuckles softly. "That's great," he says, in a sardonic voice. "You know what he did, don't you?"

"He consigned his own memories to Oblivion, probably having written them down beforehand. He sealed away those records. He had his servants lie to him once he'd obliterated what he knew. Then he went to you and lied. He's probably re-reading the truth in his own hand right now."

"Steersman," says Egress. "While I find your turn of dark humor refreshing, this is not the time. If you seek division, by all means, continue. I have come here to unite. We cannot succeed without coming together. The Sidereals are not leaders. It is not clearly not your nature. Only a renewed Deliberative can face this. Only acting together will we succeed. If you could have destroyed the Deathlords, you would have, Steersman. You cannot. Your pet Dragon Bloods cannot, either. They have been amassing power for centuries and they move in places where none can safely go. If I could destroy the Deathlords, I would have. I cannot, either. We need you to succeed. You need us to succeed, as well. Are you willing to fight beside us now? I see no choice but to throw the full power of the Celestials against this threat. It is a battle of strength, but even more it is a battle of lore."

"You appear to be here, in this meeting, with your fellow Celestials," observes Kejak dryly. "I have told you what we have learned and will continue to do so once your ego no longer claims the floor. Now. May I continue to reveal what we have learned so that you may take action?"

Davron puts his hand to his forehead, where his Caste Mark would be. He shakes his head at Egress, and speaks aloud. "I for one do not doubt that the second fate could come to pass. Even in the face of doom, we argue amongst ourselves." And the memory of Three Crossings is still disturbingly vivid in his mind. He goes on: "If we were to accept the third fate... what will happen to Creation? Can it survive without the Celestial Exalted who were ordained to protect it? Or must mortalkind follow us beyond Creation if they are to survive?"

"Presumably the Celestials are either fools to abandon their responsibility, or Creation is safe enough to longer need them. Or Creation is threatened by whatever they go to war with," Chejop replies, more evenly. "But since the Sidereals are also foretold to go, I imagine it is an issue that genuinely requires our attention."

"There's a question, perhaps two, that I would ask, if I may," Ramar speaks up. His voice carries across the amphitheatre with little effort. "You speak of the fact that we are doomed even now... and if nothing changes, we shall remain doomed... but, is there nothing that can be done to change this? Is it possible to free ourselves from this doom?" There's a slow determination to his voice, an intensity that builds with each word, as a seed taking root in a field first casts out its roots, then begins to grow steadily.

"There is a way. It...." Chejop has started to speak, but halts. He reaches for his chest, and his breathing becomes more labored. "I.. No...." He gurgles twice, falling to his knees. Collectively the room's occupants surge forward, crowding around the man. There's a sudden wash of Essence that floods over everyone and everything.

As the gathered Celestials draw back to defend themselves or appraise the situation, each sees the same sight - the Steersman of the Sidereals, laying on the floor. A trail of blood begins to trickle from his mouth. But all here know that he has died. Suddenly, unexpectedly.

The room explodes. Men and women turn to each other, speaking rapidly. The more alert of the Solars, and virtually all of the Lunars, are quickly scanning the chamber, senses heightened for any mundane or magical trace of whatever caused the old Exalt's expiration.

Egress narrows her eyes as the man dies. She looks to Davron and Ramar, "Sorcery? Have they struck at us even here?" she asks. "Was he ill?" she demands of the Sidereals. Seeing they are looking about like the lost, she begins to focus her powers, gathering essence to her, her anima flaring up. "Can anyone see anything?!" she roars out, and above her the ascending lion roars as well, its eyes wary, but glowing with fury.

This gets the group's attention. Even the Solar Exalted will come to order when one of their number demands it. "He was not sick," the sibilant voice of Black Ice Shadow replies from behind his mask. "There was no sorcery," confirms Erisus, the Lunar No-Moon, who is also in attendance here. Several other of the more magically-inclined nod their heads in agreement.

As the room quiets down, Chi-Yosh breaks from the pack and swiftly comes to the side of the ancient Sidereal. Carefully, respectfully he rolls the man over, and presses fingers into Chejop's chest and throat, Essence bleeding through his fingers into the still warm body. If it was not magical, it might have been a poison - though somethign that could decimate an Exalt that powerful would have to be impressive. A thought brings him to the trip to the City of Water.

There are no obvious wound-marks, and no clear discolorations, dilations, or any other symptoms of poison. Other than slowly advancing age, the man was in the prime of health.

It's upon a closer examination that Chi-Yosh detects abnormalities in the tissue. It's not merely his throat; the Steersman's entire body has become somewhat less intact, although in such a subtle fashion that even the Easterner questions his perceptions. The explosion of Essence may have been responsible, or it may be the sign of some unknown attack.

Chi-Yosh stands. He points to several members among the gathered, of those sound in magic and medicine alike. "Chejop seems to have lost a certain consistency to his materialism. Please come forward and help me take a closer look at this."

Davron presses forward behind Chi-Yosh, hanging back with the crowd at the edge of the circle. Though the other savants here have confirmed that no outright sorcery was responsible, he observes the threads of Essence as best he can, tangled as they are with the Essence of all the other Exalts invoking their own magic of observation. One thought occurs to him, as Chi-Yosh reports his observations. "Chi-Yosh," he says quietly. "When I came back from the realm of of the Artificer... do you remember what my symptoms were?"

"Damn." The voice is uttered by someone who was not there formerly. Saturn's attractive face is sculpted into a frown as she holds a glowing sphere of light in her hand. As one, everyone turns to regard her with a somewhat stupefied expression.

And at that moment, every door to the room opens. With a dozen roars that would shake the heavens, the Celestial Lions - the enforcers of Yu-Shan's law - burst into the chambers.

"You're all under arrest."
