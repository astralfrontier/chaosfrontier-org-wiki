# Gods of Eden 2005-05-13

The rest of the proceedings are almost like a dream. Or a nightmare.

The Celestial Lions, guardians of order and law in the city of Yu-Shan, transform from their feline forms into shackles and collars of flawless jade. Each lion thus imprisons one senior Exalt; each Exalt feels the presence of its captor in his or her mind, the awareness of the great barrier that is imposed between them and their own Essence. And each Exalt feels with a surety that their keeper could slay them without great effort in this state.

Those who were in the room where Chejop Kejak fell are led away, and split into groups. The Solars note in particular that known Circles are not kept together; perhaps this is to break apart conspirators. Perhaps it is for another reason.

Davron is led along with a group of Lunars and two Sidereals. He finds himself put into an enormous warehouse of ancient art, and there told to remain.

Chi-Yosh is escorted to the grounds of a factory that seems to produce unfinished human faces, along with a handful of fellow Solars and one Lunar witch.

Egress is taken to a temple of some forgotten god along with two Solars and a Sidereal. In this place, surrounded by alien and disturbing frescoes, she is commanded to wait.

And Ramar? None know where he's taken.

---

Egress finds this a rather lamentable circumstance. She will poke around the temple, at least learning what she can about where she is. Idleness seems to be still beyond her capabilities. "So we are to just wait here, then, and be useless while the one who killed the Steersman is challenged by others?" she asks of her strange captor. "I had no desire for the Steersman to be taken from us when the future still desperately needs him. How could such a thing even be possible in Yu-Shan?"

One of the Solars is Gilthane; the other is a youngblood from the Northeast named Elgren. The Sidereal refers to herself as the Lover, and is happy enough to chat with the youthful Solar from Halta. Elgren and the Lover were not themselves at the meeting, but nearby enough to be caught up in the Lions' crusade. All seem oblivious to Egress' internal conversation.

_Define 'useless' in the context of justice. As witnesses your testimony may be given at any time. As suspects your ability to cause further havoc in an escape attempt must be thwarted. As bystanders your safety is in jeopardy. As Exalted your talents are eclipsed by those of the Maidens._

"Perhaps," answers Egress. "But if the Gods were themselves adequate for all tasks there would be no need for Exalts," she adds. "I have already told you what I saw and what I know. Which is not going to change, I'm afraid, if I'm stuck here. So tell me why this is even possible? How could someone be killed in Yu-Shan? It seems that something very serious has slipped. Or been let right through. Is it not true that Celestial Lions guard all the gates?"

_The contrivance of a trusted figure would permit an assassin to enter. The deed may be performed by an otherwise-trusted figure._ The Lion's internal voices changes. _Tell me - if you were permitted your freedom, what would you do?_

"I think I would first go to Saturn and ask her what the spark of the Steersman had to say about the rest of the new prophecy," says Egress. "After that, the matter of the killer must be dealt by speaking to the spark and possibly through the use of a device my circle has used in the past called a Soul Conduit. If the most important Sidereal can be slain in the very heart of Yu-Shan, nothing productive can be done. If the situation is not explained and then the source of the problem destroyed or at least barred, the doubt and uncertainty will paralyze us. If we cannot stay safe in Yu-Shan, then there is no hope for a haven anywhere."

_Convince me that the Maiden would not already take such steps._

"The prophecy hangs upon a thread. There is a way out, a fork in the future. If the Maidens know what that fork is, it may be that their dictation or even influence of the investigation or revealing any part of the prophecy will lead us to a rather unpleasant path. If the Maidens could not see the attacker beforehand, they likely cannot now. If that is false, then they let the attack happen for a reason. If that's true, I think it would be logical that the reason is directly related to the prophecy itself. To the very fate of all Creation. I believe that our actions in this very moment are deciding that fate. We cannot second guess now. We must trust in our natures and our higher instincts. I am a spirit of activity and justice. I must help, because that is what I am."

_Would the Maidens intervene in deciding that fate?_

"I do not believe that fits the pattern of the Gods," says Egress. "Their will is carried-out by their Chosen. It falls to us to see that through. So no, I do not think they will intervene directly in this. It may even be that in doing so they would destroy any hope for the future."

_Correct. Your realization of this fact was crucial. You are granted untrusted status and may move. You may not communicate this truth to your fellow inmates._

"Fascinating," answers Egress. "Then I think I shall seek out the Maiden Saturn and learn all that I can. Perhaps there I shall find others who are untrusted and we might shed light upon this problem together." She remembers where last she met the Unconquered Sun, the Maidens, Luna, and Gaia. Perhaps there or on the way she shall find whom she seeks. Or at least get directed further.

As Egress makes to leave, the Lover gives her entranced Solar companion a pixieish kiss on the cheek. The Sidereal slinks to the side of Egress, saying nothing at all. Clearly she has mastered the same understanding.

---

The Lunars are all from the East in some fashion or another. One, Death on Wing, is a member of the Thousand Fangs Army. Rid Ketar, the Headhunter, is at least known by rumor to Davron. Crimson Claw of the Haltans, apparently known to Ketar, is also present. The Sidereals are the Engineer and the Backbreaker.

Davron would normally find himself at least somewhat fascinated by the works of art in his place of confinement. But under the circumstances, the museum warehouse is hardly even a distraction. His mind keeps returning to the sight of Kejak's fallen body, and Chi-Yosh's account of the symptoms. If only he'd had more chance to discuss the matter with his Circle-mate... but perhaps his companions may know as much, or more, simply from a greater depth of lore or experience. Or perhaps his warden... _I know there's hardly been time to investigate yet, but... what force could kill a man like that?_ he asks silently.

_The power of the Third Circle - demons or sorcery. A device of tremendous power. Interference with the tapestry of Fate._

_And whoever did it, did it under all our noses,_ muses Davron. _But... surely it could not have been done without any trace whatsoever._ He paces the floor, striding back and forth between a pair of dusty and long-forgotten statues. _If only I'd had more time to examine the scene..._ He pauses in his steps and sighs. _But then again, that would've also given the murderer more time to try to wipe out his traces. If he was in the room, or had a confederate there._ The fact that Davron himself is still a suspect need not be reiterated. _Who **is** studying the scene of the crime?_

_At the present time the Maidens of Secrets and Endings are present, along with a selection of Sidereal operatives._

Davron nods. _Ones who weren't in the Hall at the time,_ agrees Davron. _And between the two of them, I don't doubt that Jupiter and Saturn know as many ways this could've been done as I could ever have learned. But... I can't just stand idle. The guardian of our future has been taken from us, and I can't rest easily while his slayer is still at large..._

_What would you do, that Yu-Shan and all its people cannot?_

"I don't **know**!" mutters Davron under his breath, speaking aloud out of sheer frustration. Pausing in his pacing, he closes his eyes and tries to calm himself. _It just doesn't seem **right**, somehow. It doesn't seem like the natural order of things for the Maidens to do all the work and then tell us the answer. Why do we Exalted exist, if not to aid the gods in their endeavors? If they could do everything on their own, we would not have been needed._ He shakes his head. _Perhaps... it is just a matter of numbers. We mere Exalted may not know every secret, nor every manner of ending - but each fruitless avenue we explore is one that the Maidens need not follow. And every moment that passes, the trail grows colder._

_Why DO you Exalted exist?_

Davron looks up at an old statue, stilling his turbulent thoughts as best he can. He begins with what he knows. _We were originally created to aid the gods in wresting Creation from the Primordials, at the beginning of the time of men. And once that war was won... we were set to the task of protecting Creation on the gods' behalf. But... why were we needed for either task? The only thing I can think of is to extend the reach of the gods' power. Many minds, not a few - though our minds are lesser individually, between us we can explore possibilities the gods might miss. Many hands - though the gods can be in many places at once, we can be in even more yet. And... perhaps even to transcend. The Maidens may not be able to see beyond Fate, but we Exalted can travel there, if we must. Kejak himself spoke of that last, before he died._

_The Exalted can achieve what the gods cannot?_

_Say rather that the Exalted and the gods together can achieve what the gods alone would not,_ answers Davron. _No one Exalted can achieve more than our patrons can. But... we are Chosen from mortal men, and men are **different** from the gods. Lesser in wisdom by far, lesser in power - but **different**. And because we are different, there are thoughts we will think that the gods do not. Things we will do that the gods will not think to do. Not necessarily because it is beyond their ability, but simply because they are not human. Because you are not human._

_Do you think this capability somehow empowers you to aid in the investigation?_

Davron tilts his head. _Maybe not. But then again, maybe so. If I could answer that for certain, I'd hardly need to investigate anything, would I? And already, as you have said, the Maidens do not act alone - a handful of Sidereals already participate in the investigation. Clearly Jupiter and Saturn feel that there is some use in hands and minds that are not their own. Could it not be that the Chosen of the Unconquered Sun - or Luna, for that matter - might also see things that the Maidens and their own Chosen might miss? The gods are different from one another as well, after all._

_Correct. Your realization of this fact was crucial. You are granted untrusted status and may move. You may not communicate this truth to your fellow inmates._

Davron nods, feeling his shoulders relax a little beneath the jade collar. _Understood,_ he replies. _Then I shall seek out the investigators, and find out how their investigation stands now. My uniqueness would be wasted if I spend it covering avenues that have already been explored._ With this, he turns and heads for the door in silence, already going over the Third Circle lore he had studied in his mind - and trying to recall what he could of his time in Autochthon's domain. The similarities between Chejop's death and Davron's near-death in his own machine, though feeble, may have some bearing on the case. Wouldn't it be ironic, he thinks to himself with a touch of amusement, if my 'uniqueness' turns out to be simply being a guinea pig?

Of the others with Davron, only the Headhunter has also mastered whatever the Lions sought, and he accompanies the Solar out.

Rather than trying conversation with his cellmates, Chi-Yosh has focused inward in meditation. He does not like being caged up - not because of the unsettling appearance of half-constructed faces, but because they are trapped. He is restless; he could be doing something, anything outside, but instead they are here, being watched. He begins to construct an idea, a plan, before turning to the binding the lion provides. Speaking to the presence within the bidning, _How many Exalts are in Yu-Shan for Calibration?_

_I am not authorized to release exact figures._

Chi-Yosh knows now this is going to be difficult. _If you cannot give exact figures, can you give me an idea of how many Celestial Lions there are compared to the number of guests in Yu-Shan?_

_A sufficient number. Justify your interest in this data._

Chi-Yosh says, _Several dozen Exalts were shackled by the Celestial Lions. There may be more who were around at the time, and claimed from suspicion. That narrows down the amount of Celestial Lions able to assist in the investigation. A large number are likely guarding exits from Yu-Shan. More removed. So with a small number assisting the Maidens, will it take the Maidens longer to find all of the evidence?_

_Do you doubt our abilities?_ the Lion asks

Chi-Yosh offers, _The most skilled carpenter in the land can make the strongest, best house, but a dozen capable artisans can build a sturdy, fine home faster. Can you tell me, will the maidens focus on what and how the attack is made, who made it, how they attacked unseen, or where the assailant is now? The Maidens could focus on one of these and answer it with the best of power. But can they split their great ability in four directions and do as well, as quickly?_

_Do you mean to suggest that they require your help?_

Chi-Yosh considers this. After a time, he replies, _I ask you the same question. Do the Gods require your help? Your purpose is to guard Yu-Shan, which you do. If you were not here, the Gods would have to guard, and they would have to keep their attention on the doors and the corners even as they do their business, and that would hamper them. They cannot guard every prisoner while answering the crucial questions. If they need you, why do they not need me, to do a task that frees one more avenue they do not need to search? If the answer is 'you are a threat', you are bound to me, and if I am a threat, you will use your powers on me. If the answer is 'you are not a capable to help', then I am not capable enough to be a Chosen, because I was Chosen for something the Gods felt should be done, and I am not doing it by sitting still._

_Correct. Your realization of this fact was crucial. You are granted untrusted status and may move. You may not communicate this truth to your fellow inmates._

Chi-Yosh rises from his seated position, and spares a glance to the others present before he walks to the doors, pushing free. While suspecting his Circlemates have also answered the Lion's question, he cannot be sure, so he does not immediately seek them out. Rather, he questions the lion for where the investigation has established an organized presence, and heads in the given direction.

---

Through discussion with his fellows - two Solars, Mai Bo and another he does not know, along with a single Sidereal called the Dreamer - Ramar can discern no points of connectivity. He concludes at length that the reason he is together with these people is that he DOES share no connection with them. The Lions seemed intent on breaking up known alliances and Circles for the purposes of confinement, to prevent conspiracy.

_So you believe that together we pose a greater threat,_ mutters Ramar, turning his thoughts towards the presence in his mind, _rather than a greater asset?_

_Explain._

_You separate those Exalts who have strong connections in order to prevent conspiracy, yes? Whether it is a conspiracy to murder the Steersman for whatever reason, or conspiracy to interrupt the investigation, or some other motive I can't fathom just yet. The risk of this outweighs the benefits of having those who know each other, who can complement the strengths of their allies and compensate for their respective weaknesses-work together to try and come up with a solution..._ replies Ramar.

_More individuals means more chaos and a greater overall security risk._

Ramar ponders this. _I am afraid I misunderstand you. Do you mean to say that separating groups into their individual components means more chaos and a greater risk?_

_Perhaps I misunderstand you. In your idea of justice, do you let suspected murderers roam the streets? Or do you jail them?_

_It seems unlikely that there is any physical confinement necessary with you present. As I understand it, I can be slain at any time, with ease, and there is nothing I can do about it. It is in the interest of myself, and indeed all of the suspects in this case to find the answers the Maidens seek. That said, I believe that the Exalts can serve their purpose best by functioning as they were meant to. Together. Just as Heaven operates in harmony with its various parts, so too must we, Chosen of Heaven,_ answers Ramar.

_Why do you presume that you are necessary?_

After a while, Ramar answers, _The only reason I presume this is because the answers to this mystery are net yet known. Or if they are, the person knowing them is capable of hiding them from the Maidens themselves. Unless they know what happened, and why, and are for their own reasons not acting upon the information. If this is true, then why imprison all of us? Why not simply find the being or beings responsible and do with them what they will?_

_Finding a perpetrator with sufficient power to accomplish this crime is not trivial._

_It is not. But if it was known that this would happen and how and when and by whom, why not prevent it? If it was, for some reason, necessary, why not arrange for the assassin to be apprehended after striking the fatal blow?_

_You presume that the identity of the killer is known._

_Is it?_ asks Ramar. _If it is not, then perhaps our assistance is necessary to help determine who, or why... while we may not be as powerful as the Incarnae, we can at least speed up the search?_

_Why?_

_Why can we speed up the search, or why is our assistance necessary?_

_Both._

_Well, many hands make light work. If the burden is shared, it becomes an easier task. We all have our roles to fill... the Maidens, powerful though they are, are not everywhere at once, are they? We are capable of at least serving as the eyes and ears for them if their full attention is required elsewhere..._

---

The scene of the crime is the most logical place to meet. It is where all the freed exalts will likely go. At least initially. It is there that Egress winds up after listening to the advice of the Sidereal released with her. She asks casual questions of the exalt, learning what she can. Her focus is not on who or how the Steersman was slain, but rather how the Sidereals will react and what assistance she can give them. Part of her Celestial family has been wounded, and Egress wishes more than anything to heal them. Still, she is quite happy to see that her circlemates have started to make their way to the untrusted status as well as she finds Chi-Yosh already near the scene of Chejop's death, and with a look back, sees Davron approaching as well. "It is good to see some familiar faces. I imagine you also are not precisely free, but able to move around now?" She is careful not to break the rules. Nothing will be mentioned of untrusted status, nor how it was gained.

Davron nods. "And able to assist in the investigation, with the permission of the faithful guardians of Heaven," he replies, indicating the manacles and collar that adorn him. He holds no animus toward them - the Lions are doing their job, no more, and he for one is quite glad that no one _else_ will likely have the opportunity to use Essence to hinder matters. He nods to Chi-Yosh and the Sidereal appreciatively. "I am glad to see that more of the Chosen are becoming available to lend their talents to the task of restoring... some manner of stability, at least."

Saturn, the Maiden of Endings, is aloof. Her bearing is relaxed, but her gaze carries an icy menace with it. She is on the scene, and yet only now is anyone aware of her presence. "Interesting," is all she says, regarding the gathered Solars and others. She glances over her shoulder, making the Solars conscious at the same moment of an approaching delegation.

As the group as a whole startles at her unexpected emergence, they are in turn hailed by the newcomers. Among them is the Fisher; most of the group are clearly senior Sidereals, their brows revealing half a dozen gems at minimum. "The will is to be read. My lady," one says, bowing in greeting to Saturn, who tosses her head in a dismissive response. He then addresses the remaining Solars. "Ladies and gentlemen. You are invited."

---

'The will' consists of an elaborate scroll, drafted in the Steersman's own dense, crabbed handwriting. It is more of a prophetic transcription or an oration than a division of goods, and the Solars listen.

"'My friends, my foes, my inheritors, my once-rivals,'" the scroll begins - for it is quite capable of reading itself aloud - "'You find yourselves without me and my guidance. Once there was a Great Prophecy, and it foretold three fates. Now there has been another, long intended, and it too reveals three futures. The introspection protocols and the usual study and meditation will reveal specifics, but allow me to summarize.'"

"'My death figured significantly into the preludes of each destiny, as I expected it to. Since the revelation of this as certain fact, I have begun taking steps to manage my own demise.'"

The scroll continues speaking, designating certain titles and authorities to people such as 'the leader of the Convention of the West', releasing some greater spirits from specific obligations, and empowering the Five-score Fellowship to enforce new obligations on others. Through it all the listening Solars detect a pattern: the dissolution of Chejop Kejak's authority into compartments. Whatever power he had was not meant to be wielded completely by his successor. It was to be sought out and shared.

"'If you are listening to this, I have already passed, and you presumably have not discovered the means used to kill me. Know this - that both the manner of my passing and the reason for it are significant to the destiny of Creation. The old proverb holds true - 'when there is not enough water for three men, soon there will be two men'. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and whatever you learn will shape the future of Creation. Beware half-truths, for complete ignorance of the future would be better for it.'"

It is at this point, that Ramar arrives. He seems a little worried, and quietly takes a place near his friends. He attempts to cause as little disturbance as is possible when he arrives on the scene.

"'Finally, manage your risks wisely. Use who you must, trust only them that you can control. It may be that the Solars grew corrupt and decadent beyond our bounds, but as they are now, they await our guidance. Give them what wisdom will help you. The Lunars, too, are dangerous and fey, but as they are now, they require only our respect. Give them what honor they demand and deserve, so they do not become an unnecessary enemy.'"

"'Above all, do not ever forget our mission - the preservation of existence. Sometimes one must sacrifice one's dreams so that all can keep dreaming.'"

The scroll's reading ends, although it is clear that more specific provisions await - perhaps these are meant only for specific ears.

As the scroll falls silent, the assembled crowd ignites in a frenzy of murmurs and mutterings.

Egress speaks very quietly, her words meant not for those here, but perhaps fate was kind enough to let them be heard before by the one they are meant for. "My apologies, Steersman. I saw in you an obstacle from the first and learned too slowly what you have surrendered for everything in Creation. I will see your greatest dream does not die. Your people have given mine aid with little returned. I will never forget. I will repay my debts to you."

Chi-Yosh is surprised that the Steerman had actually encouraged respect and assistance towards the other Celestials. It shows that at despite the ego and cynicism weathered by two thousand years of bitter wind, in the end there is no denying what must be done to further Fate's best plan. He leans back, and instead watches the crowd, ears open for what might help their current cause, however minute. However, in his observation, the Dawn spots Ramar, and waves in summons to his Circlemate.

Davron says, "The First Prophecy, and the future which called for our deaths, is now over. I hope we can play a more positive role in the Second." He pauses, tilting his head. "And that starts _now_, I think. We the Celestial Exalted must find the truth of Kejak's passing, it seems. The whole truth." He, too, nods to Ramar.

Ramar observes a somber moment for the Steersman. He had great vision and had given much for the cause of others. It is difficult to fathom knowing what will happen... "It falls to us then," says Ramar, as he rejoins his friends, "To discover a way to escape the fates of the prophecy.... to ensure that something better comes about because of our actions. We are in charge of our destinies. We will find the truth, rest assured, and in doing so, perhaps learn why he has passed the way he has."

Egress nods thoughtfully to her circlemates, but her mind is clearly elsewhere. She looks over to the Fisher and makes her way towards him. Assuming he's not currently involved in a conversation, she will attempt to gain his ear. "I think you know what I wish to talk about. You have seen enough of me to likely guess at my intentions. I wish to help the Sidereals. The new Prophecy is shaking up all that was known to you for so long. The first Prophecy has served its purpose, and while its lesson must not be forgotten, it no longer is the best guide in protecting Creation. Please tell me what I can do to help your people in this time of uncertainty."

The Fisher doesn't open his mouth at all; what little he does is glance to his left, as a tall and elderly Sidereal woman draws near. Although she has the haughty mein of a queen, her eyes are older and more open to truth than a self-absorbed monarch's. "I speak for the Inner Circle now," she says, her silvery voice regal. "I am the Priestess. While I understand that the Fisher advises you, in this matter I request that you speak with me."

Egress bows to the Priestess. "I will speak with you in this matter then. I believe that the future will be better served if those who know the most of it have the best help that can be found. I cannot speak for others, but I will offer myself to help you, Priestess. I am afraid of what the passing of the Steersman will do to your people. What will it mean for the Realm and the peace there that hangs in the balance. Too long have I pushed my way through boundaries without considering carefully enough. I believe the Solars can help you, and I'm prepared to lead by example in this regard. I just ask for patience. We are young, and we are going to make mistakes. I trust your wisdom to decide which mistakes we can afford to make and learn by, and which we must not be allowed to pursue."

"That is what many among us have waited to hear, Lady," the Priestess responds with as much warmth as her position and personality allow. "But you do not speak for all the Solars. Meet with me as Calibration ends, and we may speak further about a grander plan. But for now, with the demise of the Steersman, we must devote all our energies to the mystery. We, of course, welcome you in this as well." She nods inclusively at the rest of the Circle gathered here.

Davron nods. Addressing the Priestess, he says, "I too would speak with the Sidereals at a later time. My occult researches have unearthed a matter that may yet shed some light on the root causes of both the First Prophecy and the Second." He pauses. "But for now, though, I would join those who investigate the origin and nature of the magic which slew him."

"Thank you for allowing us to help you, Priestess." Ramar speaks while bowing respectfully. "In the interest of furthering the investigation, do you know when someone will cast Between the Minute and the Hour... I wish to observe the events once more, if that may be permitted."

"It is our intention to negotiate with the Lions for release of certain Essence-users and their abilities," the Sidereal replies. "We will conclude those talks by tomorrow."

"I'm sure that as many occultists as possible will be present for the casting of that spell," remarks Davron. "We should also coordinate our efforts, so that we can examine the event from as many angles as possible. ...And so that we have time to _think_ about what we will study, and how. We won't have many chances."

Ramar considers this, "You are right." He asks the Priestess, "What has been discovered so far?"

"Ramar," comes another voice. It is Jupiter, the Maiden of Secrets, who like her sibling makes her presence known amongst the murmuring will-readers with a casual disregard for such things as time and motion.

Ramar starts at the mention of his name. "Yes, Maiden?" His own voice is rather subdued, taking something of a reverent tone. "What is it you wish of me?"

"Why are you wasting my gift?" she asks with a disapproving frown.

Davron also can't manage to hide his brief but complete surprise at the manner of the Maiden's appearance. _I'll never get used to that if I have a hundred years,_ he thinks. _...I hope I'll **have** a hundred years to get used to it in._

"Your gift?" It takes him a moment, "I do not mean to waste it. I thought I would use it to observe the events as they happened under the casting of the spell we were just talking about..."

"It's easy to talk about the future. It's hard to excuse the past." Jupiter shakes her head. "Priestess, make whatever use of this one you need. He has something valuable." To which the Sidereal can only bow exceedingly low.

"You are of course, right," replies Ramar. "I will make better use of your gift, thank you for it once again," he says, sounding rather ashamed as he retrieves the mask from among his carnival-belongings. It is a plain mask, devoid of any markings, that he puts on his face.

Ramar removes the mask, "Well... I have it with me now, anyway. I will not waste it, Maiden, I promise you that."

Jupiter is abruptly gone, and with her some of the furor of the room has died down - while more has grown up in its place. "I think we are agreed that the Will was important," announces the Priestess loudly, cutting through the chatter and drawing silence with ease. "I also think it is clear that more time is necessary to digest its implications. We shall all meet tomorrow, with our guardians' approval of course. In the public square. The investigation shall begin then."
