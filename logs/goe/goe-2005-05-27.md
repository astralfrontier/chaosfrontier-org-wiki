# Gods of Eden 2005-05-27

As the occult eye of the Circle and the Chosen themselves turn upon the scene of the crime, Chi-Yosh opts to focus on the "Where", not the how. Did the attack originate in Yu-Shan? If so, how did the assailant get in? WHere are they now? With the Celestial Lions lacking in forthcoming thought, the Solar seeks those who may help his search for answers, and the first name that comes to him is one who has the mind of a criminal: Silent Wind through Dead Leaves.

The spirit had accompanied Chi-Yosh past Heaven's gate, but once beyond the threshold, they parted ways. Having made clear that responsibility for her fell on his shoulders, and _exactly_ how he would react to the bound spirit if problems had arisen, Chi-Yosh had let her go. With the fall of the Steersman by means currently undetected, at the hands of someone powerful and capable, suspicion could overlook Silent Wind's power for her expertise in such matters. Once word of Kejak's fall ran through the streets of Heaven like a thousand church bells, the spirit found it wise to find somewhere unnoticed, crowded, and distracting. A pavillion of drink and merriment seemed the perfect atmosphere to blend.

Paying no attention to the conversation maneuvered through like mist through leaves, Silent Wind found herself focused on the ancient Sidereal. Having no personal love for the Chosen of any stripe, there was no personal love lost for those who could reign and tether her untamed will. But as the rumors whip by in a tornado of fiction and suspicion, she finds herself wary. The Solars and their animal mirrors may be to blame for this Advisor of Advisor's death, and if her binder be at fault, or even in relation, what would that do to _her_? Back to the forest? Free to sink past mortal lock and beyond physical impasse where she belonged? She fumes, finding herself despising this indentured freedom.

At the same time, the fatality intrigues her. As news tinged with embellishment drifts downwind from every observation of the investigation underway, she finds it impressive that one could slay one of the Chosen of the Chosen, in a room of the most powerful alive, with every power imaginable, just hundreds of yards from the tiers of the Godly Hiearchy. The _sheer skill_, not to mention the bravado, makes her lips quirk up in silent acknowledgement. How ever could such a thing be done, and more importantly, how could she understand a legendary trick like that?

So when her binding lord comes calling, making her wince at the reminder of the ethereal collar about her neck, she agrees with only obligatory resistance to help him discover the answers to a most amazing of feats. Surely she will help, so that she may learn.

Chi-Yosh is pleased to have his vassal beside him. A home is truelly impenatrable from the outside when no air may sneak in through a crack or whisper beneath a door. No object truelly defended from theft until a tempest cannot whisk it away, or the clawing fingers of a hundred years of a breeze steal it away bit by bit. If there's a way in between the wards of Yu-Shan, the Spirit can find it from the inside-out, feel it on the tips of hand so wide. She is skilled, but not enough - the Solar must find others.

Egress is not a person of hows or whys. She knows a few suspects. They generally seem to focus on the use of demons. She seeks to eliminate or confirm this possibility. There is one fast way to find what she needs, and that is to seek the wisdom of the Sidereals. Of them she will ask every last detail about the binding of the Primordials and their servants, what tasks they may be set to, and how Yu-Shan is defended against them. For her, this investigation is a matter of lore and research. She must know more.

Demons are not the only interest, however. Solar Circle Sorcery is also a possible culprit. Such a thing as a spell can be hidden, but it is far from easy. This level of occult talent is beyond Egress, but it is not beyond the reach of her circle. She will turn to Ramar to learn all she can about the concealment of sorceries. She also will naturally learn all she can about the wards put in place in Yu-Shan against the use of such powerful spells here. If the doors are shut to demons, it does not mean one could not call them directly into Yu-Shan through other means.

The Benevolent Manifestation of Exalted Will Upon The Minions of the Defeated Primordials, informally known as the Pact, is a document whose text stretches across the high, crumbling walls of one of the most ancient of temples in Yu-Shan. The high, monolithic blocks that support the shadow-concealed ceiling flicker and sparkle in the torchlight. Its words are sculpted into the stone in the language of the Old Realm - and running parallel to these words are a translation in an alien and terrible tongue Egress does not know, but one whose very characters fill her with a nameless dread.

Many sections of the Pact are sealed - barred from viewing by a great jade slab nailed into place over parts of the walls, and sealed with the symbol of one or more of the Five Maidens. Nevertheless, much of it is readable.

The readable sections, after much reflection, suggest that the strongest binding is on the strongest of the former Primordials - the Yozis - and grows progressively weaker for the three circles of demons below them. The Malfeans, being dead, cannot be bound by the power of the Exalted in the same way the Yozis are. Nevertheless, the city of Yu-Shan was once the abode of the Primordials' most favored servants, and Egress can find nothing except the sorcerous power of the Solars that effectively restrains them from returning to their eons-old home.

Every so often, the Solar's attention to the Pact is distracted by what she thinks is motion from the characters carven into the stone. At the corners of her vision, the letters seem to dance or shift their forms. The wording of certain critical sections sometimes wavers in her peripheral sight. Perhaps it is nothing, merely the product of a busy and stressful time.

Perhaps not.

This new concern is troubling. Egress is not foolish enough to shrug off something as serious as the possible shifting of the pact. She is going to take this to the Sidereals. Surely there are among them masters of occult who have studied those walls for many years. Perhaps this is nothing new at all. Or perhaps it is a sign of a new doom far more troubling for Creation than the loss of the Steersman.

---

There was a brief examination at the moment of death, before the Lions arrived, but not enough time to learn anything of note; now, with the careful supervision of the guardians of Heaven, the time has come to study the body of the deceased in earnest. Davron is only one of over a dozen Exalted bringing their occult experties to bear on the problem - and each brings their own peculiar aptitude to the table.

Though all of the Sidereal Exalted are trained in sorcery as a matter of course, some are more naturally suited to _this_ investigation than others. Of the seven present here, three are Chosen of Jupiter, and two of Saturn. Davron can barely begin to follow their conversation or their rituals; none of them is under a hundred years old, and all of them have spent a large part of their lifetimes in the study of the magic peculiar to their castes. If any Sidereals could hope to find the magic that brought a concealed ending to their erstwhile leader, it is these - wise beyond mortal ken in the Essence forms and patterns associated with both secrecy and death.

And yet, even their skills would perhaps not avail them - but they are not alone. A few senior No Moons are there - Davron recognizes Weeping Prowler among them - pursuing an approach owing less to the formal education of the Sidereals and more to the organic ebb and flow of Essence. They converse amongst themselves, not in the precise and arcane jargon of the Sidereals, but in a much less structured, flowing language that seems almost not like language at all, and more like the breathing of the forest, or the turning of the tide.

When set against the rest of the assembled Exalts, Davron and Ramar seem like mere children. And if mere years - or even command of Essence - were the only measure here, this would be true. They are the only members of the gathering younger than a quarter-century, and none have fewer gems upon their brow than they do. But there is one skill possessed by these two younglings that none of the others have mastered - or could ever master.

Chejop Kejak's death, as all the investigators know, was accomplished by powerful magic - surpassingly powerful magic, such as could only be accomplished by a potent relic of the First Age, a demon of the Third Circle, Solar sorcery, or other magic of equivalent puissance. Alone amongst the gathering, Davron and Ramar have passed the Adamant Circle initiation - and although neither know any specific Solar magic capable of slaying Kejak in this way, the Adamant initiation brought with it a direct and intimate knowledge of Essence as it is manipulated on such levels of power - principles of sorcery that have long since faded from the minds of the few elder Sidereals who ever knew them.

Time and again, as the other Celestial Exalts come to a blind alley in their deliberations, it is Davron or Ramar who reminds them of a particular mode of resonance in the upper _mu_ wavelength, or some other forgotten bit of magical lore. The elder Exalted take this in different ways. One particular Chosen of Jupiter, an octocentenarian with seven stars upon her brow, annoys Davron with her habit of declaring that his observations are "obvious," despite the fact that no one else had even thought of such a thing. Davron grits his teeth and allows her the luxury of self-importance - keeping the investigation on track is more important than puncturing her ego.

Though Davron is no great master of mortal thought - his ways are those of artifice and now magic, not the human heart - he is made aware by Ramar and other, more junior members of the Five-score Fellowship, of one interesting fact. The egos being demonstrated here by the senior Sidereals are not mere haughtiness. Whoever unravels this riddle will likely hold great sway over the Sidereal leadership in the coming decades.

Davron dimly comprehends the consequences of this, but leaves their management up to Ramar. Perhaps his Circle, or Solars as a whole, would benefit from one Sidereal rather than another gaining preeminence - and so Davron heeds the advice of his friend the Eclipse, more and more letting Ramar do the talking for both of them, deciding whom to address and in what manner with a given sorcerous insight. But Davron is still determined that every useful insight he can offer be made available to _someone_ who can use it. What matters, to him, is that the truth of Kejak's death be discovered. Truth and knowledge and understanding - these are what Davron prizes most, and what drives him is his faith (naive though it may be) that what is right, what is real, is more important than who benefits from it.

Egress arrives with her usual flair. Which in this case is to say not much at all. She isn't precisely alone, however. A small spirit bobs along behind her. The spirit is on loan from the Sidereals, who have apparently tired of having the Solar constantly coming to them with questions. A relay is much preferred. Egress goes to Davron first, "I see you are in the thick of it. Have you learned much about your fellows? I need to find someone who has studied the Pact in great detail. I must know something, for when I looked upon it, I saw from the corner of my eye letters shifting, as if something were trying to rewrite it. I would feel far more secure knowing this is not something new. The age is troubled enough as it is."

So deep is Davron in the arcana of death magics that it takes him several moments to remember what Pact she must be speaking of. When he does remember, his face grows troubled. "Ramar, who do you think would know best?" he asks, and together the three Solars find an elder Chosen and beg leave to interrupt his spirited discussion of Essence antiharmonics.

Chi-Yosh steps inside the chamber not long after Egress. At his side is Silent Wind through Dead Leaves, who watches the gathered Chosen with a hint of discomfort and lack of trust. On the Solar's heels are two others, a regal Lunar woman and a Sidereal so common in appearance he would never be recalled when seen alone, much less within a crowd. As his associates split and begin to mingle with their own deliberatives, the Su'Katan and his vassal approach his Circle, quietly listening from the background.

Egress will follow the direction of Ramar and Davron. She knows enough to understand they are talking about the occult. Otherwise she is utterly out of her depth. Still, she could likely learn very fast here, she imagines. But her hunger for knowledge is not the usual fare. She explains quite succinctly what she was doing and what she saw. She also asks if the elder knows anything of the concealed portions of the pact and what they might concern. She imagines they are the key to many possible fates, but does not know if they are utterly beyond the Exalted to comprehend or if they might just be at the heart of this matter.

A few somewhat urgently phrased questions inform Egress and Davron that the twisting of the Pact isn't a singular phenomenon. Disturbing, but not unexpected, especially during Calibration.

More questions yield useful information. It seems that at the dawn of the First Age, the victorious Solars erected barriers of surpassing puissance around Yu-Shan. The Celestial City is locked and barred by wards whose equals were found in the city of Meru, and Raksi's domain of Mahalanka was shielded with guards of similar, if lesser, potency - and they were quite strong enough to be felt by all the Solars who traveled there, not to mention resisting detection of the Book of Three Circles for over fifteen centuries.

These barriers prevent magical transit into and out of the city except by those gates the Celestial masters of the city approved. These consist of the sixty-one known gates, a selection of private gates whose existence is only barely acknowledged to the Circle, and such unique things as the door to the Golden Barque of the Heavens and the gate to Autochthon's realm/body.

Converse with the resident daemonologists suggests to Chi-Yosh that the power of the Third Circle of demons could conceivably penetrate the wards. However, without a pass-key or weakening of the ward, it would be an extraordinarily noisy affair. Probably.

"So much about them is uncertain," moans the Dawn's spiritual contact. This being explains that the power of the highest rank of Malfean entities has rarely if ever been tested.

Throughout Chi-Yosh's questioning, he becomes aware of an occasional presence - but all he catches sight of is the shadow of a four-armed figure in armor, observing him, but never discovered itself when Chi-Yosh looks.

"We ask many questions that none can easily answer," says Egress. "I know of one Solar who might help us better, if we could reach him. And he might be able to do exactly what I am considering, if we convince him of the need. Could we not summon a demon of the Third Circle and seek to puzzle out its powers directly? There surely are not so many demons of that circle in existance. Are there records of them to be found in Yu-Shan, so that we might know which among them is the most capable of entering places that are barred against it? If not, we should seek the one who gave us the Key."

The Lions waste little time. _We cannot condone such a course of action,_ radiates Egress' captor to her. The Lions holding the other Solars likewise inform their prisoners of this fact.

In the same vein, intense questioning reveals that the Key the Circle possesses cannot, itself, cross into or out of Yu-Shan. But something of greater potency, with similar powers, could.

Finally, on the matter of the Demons of the Third Circle. Some names are whispered - even in this sanctuary of light, some things are not dared more than they must be.

Erembour, That Which Calls To The Shadows. Jacint, the Prince Upon The Tower, whose mastery of roads and pathways is said to allow him to make a road 'even unto the gates of Yu-Shan'. Munaxes, the Ravine of Whispers, whose inner darkness holds many secrets and who can cause cracks in both physical and metaphorical truths with equally unnerving ease. Nasitirx, the Profane Bell Upon The Forgotten Temple, whose words and whispers are said to carry to every corner of All Existence.

Having a list of demon names and no certain way (yet) to tell which was used, Egress must pry at the minds of her fellow Chosen further still. "So, we know that it is possible that even the gates of Yu-Shan are no bar to the Enemy. When was the Steersman last outside Yu-Shan? Is it possible that this work was the product of a sorcery thrown against him a long time ago? Perhaps even by the ancient Solars? If it is not possible for this to have been a delayed power, we must look at demons and powerful artifacts. Sadly both of those lead to many culprits and do little to reduce the score. Beyond this, there is one recourse I have heard of." Even with her little training, she has heard of the spell that will allow past events to be seen once more.

Davron grins wryly. "We have spent the past several hours, Egress, preparing for the casting of that very spell. Each of us will observe the event in a different way, as befits our abilities and knowledge. Essence can take literally any form, by definition, and even all of us put together can only emulate the seven blind men and the yeddim - but between us all we hope to observe what any one of us alone would miss."

Before the casting, Chi-Yosh's spirit companion re-approaches him. It seems that there are rumors of secret ways into and out of Yu-Shan. The spirit itself was able to find a few, but those that it discovered were locked away by long-forgotten wards with the jade seal of the Celestial Lions.

These discussions and many more play out around the hall - until finally, one of the elder Sidereals calls for silence, and the various conversations and rituals come to a halt. "We are now ready," he declares, and it is a statement rather than a question, a declaration that no one has any further questions or insights about what Essence flows they will be studying. As is often the way with a Sidereal, this haughty assertion is correct. "The Delver shall prepare the casting," he adds, indicating a Chosen of Jupiter beside him. She nods, and as the Exalted congregate around the site of the murder, she begins to shape the sorcery of Between the Minute and the Hour.

Here, Davron's youth does not serve him so well - yet All-Encompassing Sorcerer's Sight functions as it always has, and he uses his occult senses in an attempt to sniff out any use of Solar sorcery - many others are searching for hidden magics, and are more skilled in the ways of hiding magic than himself, but he hopes that no matter how well hidden, some of the stupendous power of Solar sorcery would still leak through, leaving a telltale imprint in the fabric of reality which an Adamant initiate would be able to recognize as such.

Ramar's role in the search is slightly different. His own Charms of occult and mundane observation are active, of course, but the Mask of Secrets is also in place upon his brow - the donning of the mask drew a few jealous glances from the Chosen of Jupiter present, which Ramar responds to with a respectful bow, but keeps the mask in place. The Maiden's own power over secrets will aid Ramar's perceptions, seeking out what Chejop's murderer had hoped to keep hidden.

Egress has a unique and unspoken task. She knows well that fate is in the balance. It is not whether or not the killer of the Steersman will be found, but who and when. It is perhaps no longer her task to lead the search, but rather to frustrate some of the searchers. She will position herself not far from the haughty Sidereal, and will prepare to be as distracting and disruptive of that one as she can. A master of lore, perhaps, but Egress imagines she might have the advantage in other arenas. She will use them to the fullest. As her friends seek the truth, it will fall upon her to make sure the disruptive and arrogant are thwarted at every corner.

Finally, the time for analysis is come.

Ramar, through the Mask of Secrets, witnesses shadow-play. The shadow of the Steersman, surrounded on all sides by the shadows of others. And in the meeting, he beholds a sight - the shadow of a four-armed figure in armor thrusting a spear through the body of Chejop Kejak.

Davron, through his awareness of Essence, witnesses magic. The invocation of a spell is muted through channels cunning beyond belief, similar in general nature to those he has learned of from Bagrash Kol's books. Ordinary sorcery is like blood spilled over skin; the magic Davron beholds here is like the arteries and veins of the body, blood channeled to specific purpose.

The presence of such a craft alone stuns him, for it defies everything he knows of Solar Sorcery. Where could such knowledge come from?

The gasp of some of the Chosen of Secrets, too, is heard. "The Loom... the attack came from within the Loom itself..." one mutters in shock.

"But the Guardian..."

More voices are raised. It seems the mystery has deepened.

As the image fades again, Davron asks a question of the Sidereal nearest him. "The Guardian? How is the Loom guarded?"

"The Faultless Guardian of the Loom of Fate," is the answer. It develops that there is an entity - never to be described - which shields access to the Loom. To pass it, one need merely have sufficient conviction in his right to see the Loom. Those who come with good or evil hearts are not judged by their morals. The only danger to those who seek the Loom is indifference - weakness of purpose.

There are other preventative measures, of course. But the Guardian is the final recourse, and it knows of all beings who pass by it.

"No wonder the attack was hidden - it was conducted through reality itself," says Davron in bewildered awe. An attack through the Loom would surely explain what he saw - the death-blow was almost not like sorcery at all, but a direct rewriting of reality to one where Chejop was no more. He turns to Ramar, intending to ask what he saw - but Ramar has not moved...

Egress will take in what she hears calmly. She must know a bit more if she is to properly disrupt the work of so many at once. Still, she thinks she has a way to do so. It's not as if she will not find a great deal of eager allies. All those vying for power will be desperate to gain an advantage--even one as dangerous as the information provided by those who can use the Adamant Circle, even if they must work secretly against the others. She is going to walk a dangerous line, no doubt, but with some careful planning, she can achieve all her goals and guide the Sidereals to a far brighter fate.
