With the circle splitting-up to pursue many avenues at the same time, Egress is free to poke her nose into Yu-Shan politics. This is something of a first for her, since she's conciously trying to meddle with the Sidereals, rather than just asking something of them. Either way, the path is much the same. She wishes first to find the Fisher, or better yet, find both the Fisher and the Master and speak to them together. Both have aided her in the past, and their diverse background will be a good first step.

Following the visit to the Loom, both men are speaking with their respective factions, closeted in the arguments that have grown more and more heated. Nevertheless, there is time between the shouts and panic for moments of quiet withdrawal, and it is during one such moment that Egress' wish is answered. The two Sidereals arrive with Egress at the meeting place, within the Fisher's Celestial abode, and are welcomed by the spirit-servants therein.

"I have brought you here for obvious reasons," says Egress softly. "The Sidereals are going to be forced to turn a new direction. Unfortunately, old habits die very hard. Why is it that the Gold and Bronze meet separately?" She frowns thoughtfully and suggests, "Is it not clear that the original Prophecy has been replaced?"

"Prophecies come and go. Truth is more persistent." This is from the Fisher, who walks to a bookshelf. From it he withdraws a statue, beautifully sculpted, magnificent in its simplicity. He presents to Egress. "Do you know what this is?"

"A statue," replies Egress. "Beyond that, no." She shakes her head, "The Truth is not itself a constant." She considers the statue carefully, her mind wandering far from what she holds in her hands. She is thinking of the Nation, of her people in Roleyn, and what will take place in the Realm now.

Taking it, the Fisher dashes it to the floor. The beautiful sculpture-work explodes into a shower of ruined fragments and dust; the delicate artistry of the angles is gone in a moment.

"And now, dust," replies Egress. "It was what it was, and it might be that way again, should it be wished." She looks to the Fisher, "But perhaps it is best to let what was fade and seek a new shape instead."

"Do you mourn the beauty that was lost?" he asks. "You mourn the unity of the Celestials - also now dust."

"There is a difference," replies Egress. "That is a trivial thing to me. No matter what artisan spent his hours working upon it, it could never match the beauty of the curling of a single leaf. The unity of the Celestials is rather more important. The disunity is what I am concerned by, more than anything. The Sidereals splinter into groups that I believe have no relevancy at this point. Bronze, Gold. The question has grown beyond the Solar question, don't you think? Or are some trying to pretend that the new Prophecy is but a variant of the old?"

"The Solars lie at the heart of every Prophecy we make," the Master states, flatly. He says nothing further, and a moment of silence hangs. The Fisher allows himself a chuckle. "What my colleague says is true," he admits at last. "Even trivial astrological work has often been thwarted by the presence of the Chosen of the Sun."

"So what do your sides debate now?" asks Egress. "And what can I do to put an end to this? Ever since I arrived in Yu-Shan the Sidereals have been looking alarmed and nervous. The loss of the Steersman came at a very poor time. Yet perhaps it is also a chance at something new."

"It is clear to us that the power used to kill him is in short supplies. Principally the Solars. There's a question of trust." The Fisher frowns. "We ask ourselves, did you conspire against us after all." He glances at the Master, who shrugs. "Our principal concern is the Deathlords," the dark-skinned Sidereal answers.

Egress sighs softly. "Is this room safe against prying ears? Will you hear me and hold what I say to yourselves? What you both suspect is the Solar Circle has been let loose. I think that while that is possible, there are very few who know how to use it. Most of my kindred are barely on their feet. They struggle and grow like weeds. I will forge unity among them. It is my purpose. I think it may also be my fate to help draw together the Sidereals, as well. It is clear to me that the Chosen of the Maidens are unable to overcome their divisions without aid." She nods to herself, "What I am really asking is quite simple. Will you help me create that unity? The dangers are too great. The Sidereals must act as one now, or I believe all shall be lost."

The Fisher gestures to the broken statue. "Is this easy to mend?" he asks. The implication is obvious: fifteen centuries of division will be difficult indeed to undo.

Egress laughs softly and sighs. "My friends.. you have known me longer than that. You know me perhaps better than others do. Do you really doubt I will face the challenge no matter how difficult it is?" She smiles and shakes her head, "I will not give up. There are no easy victories in this new war. It's a battle we aren't even fully aware of yet. Only our enemies know what pieces they have placed on the board. If we do not swiftly learn who it is we are to fight, disaster will likely come to us. I know where a key to unity lies. A thing lost to most for a long time."

"Let me tell you of what we've discussed," the Master says at length. "The Deathlords. They are the clearest threat. They are undoubtedly somehow behind the death of the Steersman. If not, they will certainly exploit his death and the consequent weakening of the Realm."

"Whatever solution you advance must take them into consideration."

"There are many doubts, even in that course," cautions Egress. "They very well could be behind it, it is true. But it is possible that others might have. There are many who hate the Steersman. If a powerful artifact came into their hands they might decide to use it at the moment when they would most likely be overlooked. I suggest as the first step that all present at the time of the Steersman's death be drawn into a game of Truth. We should eliminate those suspects first. I am rather confident that none of them will be found guilty, but we should get started so the focus and finally turn towards more likely targets. Can either of you tell me how many First Age Solars yet live?"

"Five sparks lie unaccounted for in the fables of the Usurpation," the Master replies finally. "Sa, once the Summoner of the Deliberative, is one. I know you have met him."

"Yes, I have," replies Egress. "So that leaves four. They are also suspects," she suggests. "And things I do not like having out on the table. I imagine every effort has already been made to find them. If their identities could be revealed it may be of use. Sa would be willing to help me, I think. Perhaps he knows of them." She waves a hand, "That is going far afield. I think I am answered, though. I believe you both will help me, now. At least I hope so. Tell me about your leaders, if that is the case. I would like to know what their strengths and weaknesses are, so I can decide who best to speak to next. And with whom I should coordinate the efforts of my circle."

"I know of Truth. There is a problem you don't seem to consider with it, Egress," the Fisher offers.

The Master listens, intently; this game seems to be something new to him. The Fisher continues. "Truth is by its nature shared. Thus it is a game that both must play. Who would administer it? And do they have secrets that they would not want a murder suspect entrusted with?"

"If I had the power to do so, I would administer it," answers Egress. "I have faced its danger once. Unfortunately, that is not quite how it works, I suspect. The real concern is how to make sure that those engaged cannot worm their way out of things. Should we catch someone who had something to do with the assassination, they must be held and every drop of information must be drawn from them."

"Of course. And each question permits a counter-question."

"Let me give you an example," the Fisher says, pacing the floor of his study. "Do you know of the Name Which Burns? The Maidens do. They fear it. And Jupiter, Maiden of Secrets, loses the knowing of any deep secret she reveals. You must find someone potent enough to master Truth, but who has no secrets of their own to reveal."

"I know of only one who can even perform Truth," says Egress. "And he is unlikely to be welcome here. So we have the gods to consider. I imagine the power required is quite great. It is going to be beyond my reach for some time. Do you have any suggestions? Surely there must be someone who can face the game."

"It has been discussed hotly," is the Fisher's reply. "But we will find someone suitable."

"Now, as to other business.."

The Fisher continues to speak. "The Realm's involvement has been discussed by our faction as well. More senior men than I are considering what to do about the Great Houses. My esteemed colleague --" Here he nods to the Master before continuing. "-- has the right idea, I believe. The Deathlords must be considered. In order to do that, the Realm must be used. It is a powerful force if united. But under whom? That is the question."

"The answer to that question divides the Sidereals."

"What candidates are you considering?" asks Egress. "I have seen very little unity in the Realm as of late. They tilt and teeter." She frowns and remembers something, then. "Is it true that there has been more than one Empress? Something that I was told once indicated that. It was a dangerous question for me to ask in a Game of Truth, and the price was high. I wonder now if it was worth the risk."

"Only the Steersman knew the full truth about the Empress. She was his to work with, ever," the Fisher answers. "I do not know how much I can reveal to you in good faith; come to our convocation if you wish to learn more. But as to candidates..."

House Sesus courts Houses Mnemon and Cynis; Mnemon herself, closest to the Empress in temperament and magical power, is clearly one of the front-runners for the throne. But it is also said that House Sesus courts the members of forbidden House Iselsi, the architects of a failed coup centuries ago and now ruined.

The Tepet and Cathak legions remain a military power, and one of the strongest bulwarks against chaos in the Threshold. House Peleps ally with House Ragara, whose financiers seek the power of those legions, and Ledaal, who courts Cathak for its military power in their quest to defeat the Deathlords.

Houses V'neef and Nellens find what allies they can, although V'neef and Tepet have discussed intermarriage.

Of the Houses, five emerge as potentials in the power struggle for the throne: House Mnemon, House Cathak, House Ragara, House Sesus, and House Peleps.

Egress listens to all this attentively and nods. "I recall now exactly what words were used," she says quietly. "They are, after all, rather hard to forget. The Mask of Winters, in a game of truth, told me that the Empress died the day she entered the Imperial Manse. The rest of what he said was also interesting. He told me she became a vessel of one of the Deathlords after that point and was replaced many times. The replacement is questionable due to the way he worded it, but the rest is Truth."

"Interesting," is the Fisher's only answer to this, and the Master glowers. It is clear that he would speak if he did not realize that an argument would ensue.

"I imagine that wiser minds than mine might find some way he could trick me with the statement," says Egress. "However, there are things I suspect to be true, now. I believe the Deathlords were Solars. This might have allowed them to have access to the Imperial Manse. I believe they killed the Empress."

"You must speak of these things to the convocation. I have no answers."

"I will go," replies Egress. "But only if the Gold and the Bronze will all come together and listen to my words. I believe we are facing something that has been destined for a very long time. I also believe the Steersman knew all about this. Perhaps he even knew of the Deathlord origin as Solars. I wish he could have told us all this, but I also believe he did nothing without reason. He more than anyone else knew the danger of knowledge."

"If there is time, you may call a meeting," the Fisher concedes. The Master hums. "I will speak to my fellows. I believe they will come."

"We must make time," says Egress. "I will be ready." She shuts her eyes, letting out a long sigh. "I must. More and more I can feel him, as if he were looking over my shoulder, as if he were the weight of the world crushing down upon me."

"That is the weight that he felt as well," says the Fisher, somberly.

"I pray I can carry it for as long as is required," answers Egress quietly. "He deserves it. Creation demands it. If I did not have so many things I know I must do, I would be terrified that I might not be doing as he wished. I imagine that would be comedy to some, but it is true. I wish I had understood him better before. Only through those who knew him will I have the chance now. I will learn a great deal from the convocation. I hope there is something they might learn from me to repay it."

"Their hope is to learn from you, and also to teach you. That is our Path," the Fisher murmurs.

---

Sixty-five Sidereals representing both factions, plus a smattering of independents, are permitted to gather. Those that are not present are implicated in some fashion - a distressing number of Celestial Audits have been kicked off in the wake of the Steersman's passing, as old grudges are settled and as old crimes are remembered and called to justice - or have chosen not to attend.

Egress looks at those who are here now and nods to herself. It is more than half, at least, though not as many as she would have wished. It is a start. She knows that Sidereals have little time for wasted words. Much like Lunars, in that respect, now that she thinks of it. "Thank you for coming to hear my words. I believe by now everyone here knows a great deal about me and what I have done. Some of you approve, some of you likely do not. I have brought you here both to teach me and to listen to what I have learned and what I believe. I am Zenith Caste, my faith is my power. I am a light for others to follow, or at least to heed. I will offer my information first."

"One of the uses of essence is a very deadly game that is known simply as Truth," Egress says. "In this game, the players take turn asking questions. All they utter must be the Truth. I know that some here are at least aware of this game and know its power. I am young and a bit foolish still, and so I played a game of Truth against perhaps the most dangerous opponent in Creation. I faced the Mask of Winters and from him learned things of use. At least it is to be hoped. He told me that the day the Empress entered the Imperial Manse she died. He also told me that since that time she has been a vessel for one of 'our' number. In this case it seemed unquestionable that 'our' meant one of the Deathlords. He went on to say that there have been many Empresses used. The last was worded in a way that weakens its certainty, but it does not seem to be the most critical detail at this point."

Those gathered here remain stone-faced; perhaps this possibility has been discussed among them, or perhaps the Fisher has carried knowledge ahead of Egress. Nevertheless, they are not here to whisper among themselves, and they know it. They remain silent, waiting.

"I believe in the wisdom of the Steersman," says Egress. "I believe he knew about this. It is my understanding that he had unique access to the Empress. I think there was a reason for this. I further believe he knew the true origins of the Deathlords. Perhaps even better than they do now. Finally, I suspect that he knew even then that one day he would die to complete the work he started with the first Empress." She pauses for a moment and says, "It is believed that the Deathlords were once Solars who were acting to influence fate itself. Solars are not masters of Destiny. Our knowledge is little when it comes to matters of astrology. So then who would suggest to the Solars to do the most extreme of actions to alter Fate? Who would konw enough?"

"I know of one who was in the position to do and know all of this," says Egress. "I believe the Steersman knew all these things. I believe he even planned for the turning of the Solar candidates into Deathlords. A terrible gamble to make, no doubt, but one that he would have been strong enough to face. After all, fate was his province and I do not believe any here would even now question his mastery of it."

"He'd never have countenanced such a thing," one voice calls. Other voices rise up in agreement. "He believed in the Prophecy."

"Of course he did," replies Egress. "The Prophecy was not a thing to be doubted. However, it spoke of probabilities and chances. The Steersman was not foolish enough to gamble everything on a remote chance. However, he was also wise enough to not put all his eggs in one basket. He saw a way to evade fate, to change the very nature of destiny. As he died, he made it clear that he-and I think he alone-knew how to change prophecy in a specific way. It is one thing to realize that destiny itself can be altered by those things outside it. I would say only the Steersman had the vision of just how those alterations can be controlled."

"His position would never allow it," the original protester replies. "We have always taken the influence of the Yozis and the Malfeans into account."

"Oh?" asks Egress. "Then why did the Prophecy change? Why have I seen Sidereals all but cowering since Calibration began? The Steersman kept his secrets tightly hidden, but I believe he left a trail for those with open minds to follow. I believe he wanted me to learn what I have. I have brought this information to you because I believe in the Sidereals. I trust in your wisdom, but the years have been long. The divisions grown so very deep. I am not one of you, so I have never myself been divided. I have associates, whom I think of as friends, among the Bronze and the Gold. I believe those old ways are no longer valid. They were focal points that were critical in getting this far, but now they stand in the way."

"He's right, you know," comes another voice, insouciant and young. "He's right because it is the destiny of the Steersman to obey prophecy. It has always been the destiny of the Ronin to flout it." This is Kez Sark, the Ronin, who makes himself known by rising from where he sits and waving.

The reaction he gets from his fellows is that of a plague victim, but he seems to ignore it, stepping forward through the small groups of fellow Chosen.

"Obey prophecy," murmurs Egress. "Tell me, what did he see that went beyond the new Prophecy? What was he suggesting? Why is it that he alone knew a way to escape the fate? Assuming he had lived, it would have been his duty to obey the Prophecy by finding that way, would it not? I see no reason he could not have done all I suggest and be disobedient to the Prophecy. I would say instead he was the only one who truly understood the fullness of its meaning. He alone knew the entire Prophecy."

"That knowledge is given to all of us. Do you suggest he had some knowledge we lack? I doubt it," the man in the audience avers. "He certainly had special insight. But that was his job."

"I suggest it," answers Egress. "If not, why would anyone have gone through such trouble to destroy him?" She looks thoughtful for a moment. "There are many powerful exalts that exist. Why target him? Why slay him if he was not especially talented. Can you tell me what he was about to say when he died? If you cannot, you must agree that he saw things that no other Sidereal was able to."

"I can tell you that we'll find out," a death-draped voice answers. Standing, a man who formerly evaded notice makes himself known, and even among this quiet group a hush falls. The man who rises has black hair, pale features, and a cloth mask that conceals the lower half of his face. The black orbs that are his eyes study Egress from emaciated sockets. "I will be the one who communes with his soul, in due course."

Egress recognizes him by rumor. It is Black Ice Shadow, an experiment of sorts. He is said to know much about the Deathlords. Perhaps too much.

"You may find out," answers Egress. "If it is destined for us to do so. Yet you did not know. The Steersman saw things no one else has. He had to. It was his duty and fate to guide Creation. If you do not deny that he had insight beyond what you have seen, you cannot logically deny that he originally did as well."

"Then what is left to determine is whether that insight mattered in this case," the original debater speaks up.

That is answered with a great deal of conviction. "I doubt anything the Steersman ever did was without purpose. Nothing he did should be seen as less than significant. To think that would be foolish."

"Not all insight is applicable to every case. There are some things that must transcend even us." But the man seems to have made his case and quiets down, leaving the floor for others to talk.

Egress looks over the Sidereals slowly. This part she isn't sure of. She's not sure how to appeal to these men. Honesty and directness is all she has to offer. "I want to help the Sidereals. This is a bad time. The Prophecy has been replaced with a new direction, the Steersman is dead, and for better or worse, the Solars have risen again. Their power cannot be ignored. We are useful, and at least some of us are willing to work with you, rather than thrashing about without your guidance. I believe in time, I can bring you far more hands willing to heed your words. What I ask in return is to be given a chance to grow and to learn. I am young, but the young hate being called children. Tell me why I am doing what I am. If there is no answer or I may not know of it, tell me that, as well. It is time for the Solars to repay their debt to Creation and to the Sidereals, who stopped them from destroying everything they treasured."

"Death marks your face," says Black Ice Shadow, without preamble. A murmur runs through the assembled throng at this; the threat of the Deathlords may be a topic of discussion, but to have someone like this say such a thing is disturbing. The black Sidereal continues. "You've seen it, haven't you."

Egress nods slowly, "I have seen death," she answers quietly. "I have gone over. I have spoken to the Dragon Kings, as well. That way is not so different for me as it would be to others." She does not speak of it willingly, but she will not hide it. Especially if it might be of use. "The Dowager killed me in as many ways as one can slay another. But I have returned through shadow and fog to stand again."

"Commendable," the ghost's whisper of his voice answers. "I will assist you." He turns, smiling, to address the group as well. "Wayang - the Black Puppet Mask. He will see the truth of these things. Will any of you under his Aegis question him?" This sets up another series of disturbed murmurs.

"If you wish to work together," another Sidereal speaks - the Engineer, a senior among the Chosen of Journeys - "There are things we must discuss. The role of the Solars. Lunar cooperation. The Realm. The Deathlords. Each of these things must be taken into consideration."

"Of course," says Egress. "The role of the Solars is going to be something of great interest to us all. Lunars I believe will be willing to cooperate. I have some standing among them, and I comprehend them. Their wrath at the Realm burns very hot. It will take some colossal work to cool it. I offer you all that I am to see that what is best for Creation is done. The Deathlords I have spoken to. A foolish and dangerous thing to do, I know, but I did not seek them save for good reasons. Very soon, I shall reveal what came of these dealings in full. Once we are sure that spies are barred from Yu-Shan again, I can speak fully to you of my great Secret."

"I think we at last can start to understand each other," says Egress. "I have a lot to learn from you. I think I and the rest of the Solars can offer you a great deal in return. With time and patience, I know we can succeed and ensure that Creation thrives." She looks to the Engineer and says, "I believe we have a great deal to discuss. I am no master of investigation, but my Circle has many gifts that may be of use. I would serve them better working out the critical details of the future, however, and doing what I can to help coordinate the efforts of all the Celestials as we seek to find out who killed the Steersman."

"In doing so, you must have answers that are not what we've already foreseen as routes to failure," says the Engineer. "Many an attractive path leads to ruin. We will inform you of these as we learn of your plans. But we must know your secrets."

"You shall have them all," answers Egress. "Assuming we can speak in a place where no unwanted ears can listen, I will reveal everything." She looks around slowly, then asks, "Is there any place even in Yu-Shan that we can trust to achieve that? If you believe there is, I shall reveal what you ask. If you believe that I should speak now, I will."

"The death of the Steersman aside, our meeting-places are as secure as any."

"We have the Book of Three Circles," says Egress. "We defeated Raksi and took the Book from her. In her madness, she caused the Book to slay her, thus depriving the Lunars of one of their most powerful heroes." She cannot hide the fact that she thinks Raksi was nothing of the sort.

"Raksi's death was known of. Now its cause is explained." This is Black Ice Shadow, concealing something of a quirky smile. Not of pride, but of some secret knowledge or amusement.

This news, in particular, sends many stirs through the crowd.

Egress goes on, "It was my former self's intention to serve as Heirophant and to revive the Deliberative." She frowns thoughtfully, "I no longer see this as my destiny. Gallius was the first Heirophant of the new Deliberative. She is dead. I do not plan on replacing her. The Book is a great resource and could do much for us. However, it is also a danger, and the Mask of Winters knows we possess it. What I have done to counter the Deathlords in this aspect is to rally the Solars and draw them together to claim Denandsor. We will repair its defenses and we will use it as a seat of power against the enemies of Creation. It seems to me that this is wise. It gathers the Solars and gives us a safe haven against our enemies."

"As safe as anywhere can be," murmurs Black Ice Shadow ominously, calling to mind the current crime.

"It will have to do," replies Egress. "With the power of the Adamant Circle, it may indeed become almost as safe as Yu-Shan." She emphasizes 'almost' quite intentionally. "For a long time I had thought that the Realm must be brought low. Then I came to grasp that it would be too dangerous to destroy it or even to try to conquer it in war. There would be enough time for the Deathlords to move against us. Perhaps the Fair Folk would also make use of the opportunity. The Realm is a question that needs answering. Who can lead it? What is to become of it if the Solars are to rise again? The Immaculate philosophy is being slowly weakened by the actions of the Solars. I am concerned that this will reach a critical point."

"Some of us believe that the only viable course is one that is philosophically compatible with the Immaculate Philosophy. Right now is the time for unity, as you say. Anything that fractures the Realm's society further is detrimental," points out a new voice.

"That does sound wise," agrees Egress. "The question is how to make it work well. Hmm." She shakes her head, "I am sure you have many ideas already. I understand there has been a great deal of debate. Would someone care to present for me the courses that have the most support at the moment?"

"The obvious step is to appoint a new Empress. Powerful enough to hold off her rivals, weak enough to be controllable. Alternately, permanent alliances between the Great Houses, in ways that leave them ideologically factionalized but practically allied, so that we have points of leverage. Alternately, theological rule with the Immaculates themselves in positions of power. Alternately, assassination and replacement of the heads of the Great Houses."

"It would be logical to try a new Empress," says Egress. "I am unsure what candidates would be best for this role. I know very few of the dragon blooded that dwell inside the Realm itself. The Solars could make her climb to power very smooth and destroy any opposition that might rise. It is up to you to decide the way, but whether social, economic, or outright death, we can aid you very surreptitiously. To form permanent alliances, we can offer you diplomats and negotiators that when guided well can achieve your goals. If desired, Solars can also pose as immaculates. I am sure that we can prove very useful and with the aid of Sidereals, be extremely hard to detect."

"The debate is ongoing, and we appreciate the offer."

"Knowing our capabilities may help you decide which course is best," says Egress. "Once we master the Adamant Circle, I believe we could do essentially anything you wish. In time, we can again march against the Fair Folk and push back the Wyld. Too much has fallen to it's rising tide." She corrects herself with a snort, "That is something for a distant day."

Egress listens on to the advice of the Sidereals and probes more for information about their possible plans. She does not realize it until afterward that the questions they pose her are not the chiding ones she is used to. The treatment of a child is fading. The power of her voice and her will seems to grow as well. Egress has learned to sense moments in time when everything is as it should be. She remembers them well. When she returned to claim the throne of the Nation of the Sun. When she first claimed it is more dim, but she knew it then, as well. This is one of those moments in time when she is in the very place she belongs, doing exactly as she ought to be doing. With the warmth of that feeling in her, she knows that she is pursuing the proper course and doing her part to bring about the destiny that the Steersman would have wished for.
