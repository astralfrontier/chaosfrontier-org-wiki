# Gods of Eden 2005-07-08

A few points are clarified by speaking with Havesh the Vanisher, as Davron studies the machine. First, that a working model was not present in Jerak's hidden cache, at least that Havesh remembers - the only things there were notes and parts, and those were destroyed in an explosion when he booby-trapped the cave.

And second, that he does not know who entered that cave, only when they did.

With the insight from Havesh, the Circle splits. Davron returns to the Arcanicine once more to study the craftsmanship. Even though it no longer holds the Essence-signature of the destroyed machine, the artifice was created by someone. Meanwhile, a trustable Celestial caster capable of wielding Between the Hour and the Minute is sought to accompany Havesh to investigate Jerak's cache. Before the Circle can set forth to find a likely candidate, a Sidereal named Parter of the Veil finds them, passing his recommendation pinned by the Master.

Havesh and Parter of the Veil, accompanied by Chi-Yosh, make haste to the lush jungles of the Southeast. Within an ancient river basin, hidden beneath an elemental grave yard, below a steep, vertical shaft of sifting walls and nests of vipers, and past a treacherous cavern of tightrope spiderwebs lies the blasted entrance of the alcove of wicked design. Parter of the Veil, the silent figure cloaked in ethereal shrouds, tosses up an hour glass to shatter, sending the sands about the cavern, allowing the grains to sift into glyphs as they fall. The ritual has begun.

Through the magic of the Celestial Circle, images begin to form. During the journey, Havesh has provided his best estimates about the time of the break-in, and the sorcery delves into this series of moments without hesitation. The Solar's estimations are highly accurate, for no more than a few minutes pass in the scene before the group perceive activity in the vision.

A demon appears, crawling on four legs that end in hands, approaching the cave. It is a lanigrevireen, called _champions of pain_ in Malfean lore, and it dashes into the cave. There is a resounding explosion, whose auditory component is severely muted by the spell, and the entire hillside under which the cavern rests can be seen to shudder. Then it settles. Nevertheless the demon's work is accomplished - a bundle of cloth was thrown clear through the collapsing doorway. And it is retrieved by a man familiar to all through their time in the tense interrogations in Heaven - one of the Inner Circle of Chejop Kejak. "The Seeker," murmurs the Sidereal, emotionlessly, naming the man depicted.

"The Seeker," repeats Chi-Yosh. More Sidereal conspiracy. Given that the Priestess sought to tamper with Wu's power of the machine, she must have been aware of the Seeker, so why not report him when arrested? Or are there further wheels within wheels? Havesh confirms that nothing survived his picking and cleaning and the devastation from his trap. With what they came for in hand, the trio crawl from the hidden stash of the First Age and make their way back to Yu-Shan.

Egress takes the news calmly, feeling the parts start to click into place a little more. "The Sidereals certainly make mortal politics seem rather drab and obvious," she says softly. "Their webs are best unravelled by their own hands. We should see about questioning the Priestess again, and if we still need more information about the Seeker, we will turn to the Sidereals we know best." If one ever truly does know a Sidereal at all..

The Priestess, in spite of things, is being confined - 'for her own protection', according to the Celestial Lions. The Solars detect no hint of sarcasm or conspiracy from this admission; the enforcers of law in Yu-Shan are, in their own fashion, incorruptible. Perhaps her life is at risk from the vengeful.

Nevertheless, the group is granted audience, and Egress relates to her - with reservations - what the Solars have discovered.

The Priestess tells a story, and even as she does she makes it clear that she is being pumped for information. She responds evasively, but never truly evades an important point. It is verbal swordplay, but the sparring of two old and experienced adversaries who merely wish to show their skills. She begins by explaining that she and "a few of the others in the Inner Circle" foresaw a specific danger, and realized that Wu's power was crucial to its success.

Egress enjoys a good match, and takes it very seriously. There is more here than just an exchange of information. If she is to make this Sidereal accept the offer of protection and amnesty from the wrath of heaven, she must prove herself worthy. She aims for those who were in the Inner Circle, drawing attention first to one, then another, never pinning one down. Simply put, she is shooting all about the mark, but not yet showing that she sees a bullseye to target.

On the Inner Circle the Priestess is more vague. She cannot in any sort of good faith withhold what is known about its members, or what they are like in public. The activities of the group are also well known. It is not an official organization within the Five-Score Fellowship, but a social group - yet it is powerful nonetheless. Its members are all elder Sidereals of considerable power, prestige, and talent.

Egress will prove that even when she seems to be beaten she can draw a victory. When the Priestess notices that the Zenith's attention seems scattered and patternless, Egress will smile. "I do indeed know something, and I will share it with you, but there is a price." Egress raises a hand and explains, "I will only tell you what I know if you will at least advise me until this affair is drawn to its conclusion. If you accept this task, I will expect you to use all the talents you have to see I pursue the best course of action in all things. There is much I mean to achieve in Yu-Shan. The Steersman is simply the most immediate of concerns in my mind, and the most severe. But it is far from the only thing I must see to. It is what comes after that I must be properly prepared for."

"A heavy price. I pay it gladly." The Priestess's words are simple, this time, and without guile.

"Very well," says Egress. "A short time ago, a member of my Circle went with Parter of the Veil to look on a certain hidden cave that once held plans to build a device that put the power of Wu to use. Naturally it was warded and any who broke into it would spring a terrible trap. We know now who looted the cave. It was one of the inner circle. The Seeker. Once I am properly readied, I mean to lead the Lions to him and have the truth drawn from him. I find it hard to believe that simple ambition would lead to the murder of the Steersman at this point, but perhaps you can shed some light on the personality of the Seeker so that I might know better."

"He is.. obsessed with knowledge," the woman answers, thinking back. "He is a scholar and student of antiquity. Nothing pleases him more than to learn something new. His only point of contention with the Steersman was the destruction or concealment of First Age ruins and artifacts on the Blessed Isle. This was a necessary step to maintain the Immaculate doctrine. He was otherwise very satisfied with his position, to the best of my knowledge."

"Yet he went to find something that just happened to use a power that you altered the very Loom to try and stop," says Egress. "I find it impossible to think this is a mere coincidence. He was aided by a demon in his act of looting, but I rather doubt he was a servant of the Yozis. Tell me, was the Seeker a craftsman?"

The Priestess nods. "He has a great interest in art and artifice of all kinds, of course. But... we do not know precisely who lay behind the attack. That knowledge was kept from us during our foretelling. The Seeker does not have sorcery enough to block the strands of fate in such a way."

"But who does?" asks Egress quietly. "We know he had the means and the knowledge to use the tool that would have greatly aided an assassin. The motive seems dubious right now. I imagine the Seeker could be questioned in a beneficial way, but I would like to know more of the answers first."

"Sorcery interrupts fate. It must be capable of doing so, by its nature - Exalted sorcerers tamper with what is, introducing new things into what we used to call _dharma_. Sorcery to interfere with the Maidens' Chosen and their Charms would be on par with the Solar Circle."

"So we come back to the Deathlords and the Solars once more," muses Egress. "Unless the stories I've heard are true. Then all the Celestials could be suspects." The Zenith steeples her fingers and leans forward, "Unless the Seeker has the Mantle of Brigid.."

"Ha!" The Priestess laughs harshly at this. "Only the Steersman knew whether the Empress really had the real thing - if there is a real thing. If she did, only the Empress would know where it went. The Seeker would not keep such things from us unless I'm truly blind."

"If we cannot say whether it even exists, dare we assert that we could know it by sight?" asks Egress quietly. "If we discount the mantle for now, that leaves us with Solars, who lacked the proper tools, and Deathlords. Deathlords aren't the easiest target, however. Are there other culprits I am missing?"

"A demon - if one could physically enter the city and be detected. I consider this unlikely. We have regularly called demons of the Second Circle in the past, commanding them to enter Yu-Shan undetected. They have always been noticed. Always."

"What of the Third Circle demons?" asks Egress. "Are there no ways to summon them outside of the Adamant Circle?" She frowns thoughtfully, hoping that the Seeker can have some answers wrung from him one way or another. "Also, do you think it is wise for me to confront the Seeker with what I know, or should I try to learn more first? We had thought to use the machine we unearthed as a trap, but I doubt the enemy will be foolish enough to pursue it."

The Priestess shrugs winsomely. "No ways that I know. I consider it wiser to learn more, but .... you asked for counsel. For you, it would be _better_ to confront him now. Wiser is not always better where Solars go."

"Then I shall do as you suggest," answers Egress. "It is time to get our answers. I believe he will be a good host. I do not think I look kindly upon him when things are done, but we shall see. In the end, nothing in this whole pursuit has proven as simple as it first appeared. I shall return to talk more to you later. I hope to have better answers by then."

"Good luck," says the agent of Fate.

Davron, a craftsman of no little aptitude himself, recognizes the Arcanicine as a work of art - the product of, if not greater skill than Davron, then certainly greater knowledge and understanding of magical artificing. But even so, it is still built along the same design principles as any other artifact of Autochthonian Essence-science, and thanks to the Book of Bagrash Kol, to say nothing of the Book of Three Circles, Davron knows more than his share of those principles.

Among other things, Davron knows that Autochthon's nature is defined, more than anything else, by a relentless pursuit of order which leaves as little as possible to chance - and that this provides few opportunities for a craftsman to leave his distinctive mark on a work, even if he wanted to. But few is not none.

The first and most obvious check is for a deliberate maker's mark, some characteristic engraving or glyph that was designed to identify the artificer. Davron hardly expects to find such a thing on an artifact that must needs have been built in utmost secrecy, but it does not take long for him to check the obvious places - under the anterior cowling, on the surface of the solid brass central gear, or several dozen other places where it would not interfere with the Essence flow - and find nothing of the sort.

That possibility exhausted, Davron considers what the artifact can tell of its artificer's personality. Does the artificer strive to build his submodules to wring every last drop of Essence out of the flow, or does he instead choose to sacrifice a little efficiency for the sake of a simpler mechanism? Are the gear-spokes utilitarian and straight, or twisted in intricate but decorative crosshatches? In short, what principles does the artificer strive for more than others - efficiency, maintainability, aesthetics?

Even the materials itself may have something to say. Certain of the parts are necessarily made of the Five Magical Materials, of course, and many others are constrained to be of particular mundane materials - brass, steel, or stone - but others need contribute nothing other than strength against stresses, or the ability to conduct Essence of a particular aspect. Which does the craftsman use, when he has these choices? Granite or marble for a bearing-sheath? Gold or silver inlays for the control runes? These choices may reflect limitations on what the artificer had to hand, or simply personal preferences.

And these mundane materials must come _from_ somewhere. Davron spares a few samples of the device's components for more destructive testing - taking careful notes of what the parts had been, of course - to gain a detailed assay of what exactly is in them. Many metal ores, for example, contain slight impurities that differ from one region to another, and knowing where the Arcanicine's components came from may be a clue to where the artificer's suppliers may be.

At last, the Solar rises. He must find the others. This is important.

Egress has learned a thing or two about operating in Yu-Shan. It's a great deal about appearances. The prestige of the Solars is on trial here as much as anything else. Egress sends for those of her Circle who are available, with a few invites for some gifted Solar judges she met earlier, as well as any Elder Lunars who wish to join in this. The Fisher and the Master are once again contacted and informed (vaguely) of what is about to take place. Finally, Egress will ask the Lions to join her as well. She is not going to act alone in Yu-Shan any more. One does not demonstrate leadership among the Celestials by acting on their own.

Along the way, Egress will make basic explanations of what is happening and what has been learned. Specifics are not required at this time. The Seeker will have to cough up answers one way or another. Egress has a feeling that even with all the power of the Celestials, it is the Lions that will put the most fear in the heart of the Seeker. Should his sentence be a terrible one, Egress is not sure whether intervention of any kind is called for. Still, even heading to find the Seeker, it seems a terrible loss of guidance. The inner circle of the Bronze Faction is being torn apart. The Zenith, its former bitter enemy, thinks this shift in political power is far too radical. She must curb it, somehow. She will rouse herself from such thoughts. She has a new opponent. Old, powerful, subtle beyond her understanding of the word. Egress is looking forward to this.

Davron, Egress, Ramar, and Chi-Yosh join with the others in encountering the Seeker. He is busy with business - Yu-Shan does not stop moving, even during carnival - but he receives the delegation as politely as the Priestess did. This time, though, there is no confession, merely an expression of mute surprise at the show of force. "How may I assist you?" he asks.

Egress studies the man silently for a time, frowning in thought. Seems surprised, does he? Perhaps this will be the first absent-minded Sidereal Egress has ever met. She doubts that. "We have some questions for you, Seeker. We too pursue enlightenment and as you know, the murder of the Steersman is the one thing we are chasing most diligently. I believe you may have some very useful information for us. After all, you did recently seek out some long-hidden plans that would reveal a great deal of information concerning a device that could be built to help one avoid detection, even in the most guarded areas in Yu-Shan."

"I did?" The Seeker thinks back for several moments, then enlightenment dawns in his eyes. "Ah! The... Arcanitan? Arcanicine. Yes, I remember. Do you think it is connected?"

"It certainly seems likely, don't you agree?" asks Egress. Is he really as clumsy as he's seeming to be? "Now, could you please reveal what you learned about the device? I imagine for one as curious as you are, it was impossible to resist the urge to construct it." She looks at Davron for a moment, then back to the Sidereal, "You are aware, of course, that it is a most terribly dangerous machine, are you not?"

"Reveal? Yes, of course. I'll show you what's in the archives." He approaches the group, gesturing at the door out. "This way."

Davron raises an eyebrow at Egress when she looks at him, and tilts his head. "I hope this man can help us find the person we're looking for," he says, as the Seeker moves toward the door.

Egress looks at Davron and nods. "I think he will point us in the right direction," she murmurs softly. She will then follow the Seeker, hoping he can indeed reveal something worthwhile.

The Seeker's Archives are housed in a vault in Yu-Shan made of water halted in motion and shot through with sparkling gemstones. A guardian entity defends the front door, but responds to the Sidereal's pass-word and permits entry. Within, the Chosen maneuvers through a claustrophobic maze of halls and begins walking down one particular corridor. "What you seek is here," he murmurs. Stopping at a particular shelf, he turns and gestures grandly. "Thus!"

It takes him a moment to realize, from the faces of those watching, that there's nothing to see at the end of his fingertips, and he turns to regard this mystery in stupefied disbelief. And then: "Arnon!"

A younger man, also apparently Chosen of the Maidens by the faint tracery of stars in his eyes, appears at the end of the corridor in response.

As Arnon enters the room, Davron's eye is drawn to the intricacy of detail in the man's robes - and the pattern itself, which seems strangely familiar. "What is it, Seeker?" asks Arnon, in clipped, businesslike tones - the voice of a man whose careful attention to efficiency as well as detail is reminiscent, to Davron, of the Arcanicine's design.

"Where are the pieces that are supposed to be here?" the elder Sidereal demands. The youth shrugs. "Everything was there when I last checked."

The shrug causes the robes to fall away from Arnon's hands, and Davron takes careful note of the youth's handspan. That, too, is about right. He rests a hand on Egress' arm and nods significantly.

Egress turns her eyes on young man and looks meaningfully to the Lions. "So you are Arnon?" she begins casually. "I think perhaps you are just the one we wish to speak to. If we might have a moment of your time?" The way she says it is gentle as can be, but there is a glow in her eyes that makes it clear the man has two choices. To go with her, or to face the concentrated wrath of some of the most powerful Celestials still alive aided by some particularly unamused Celestial Lions. "I believe you have a great deal to explain to us."

"I don't need to answer anything now!" the youth returns, defiant.

The Seeker, rather startled by this turn of events, stays silent. Clearly his interrogators know more than he about this matter, and he intends to watch - and to learn.

Yet Egress diverts the questioning to make a point. "Seeker, did you know that this young man built the device? Unless I miss my guess, it seems he also used it. Yet this is just part of the answer, I think. Who helped you in this, Arnon? Who else knew about the Arcanicine you built?"

The member of the Inner Circle shakes his head, confused - it's clear that he's ignorant about what has gone on here.

As for Arnon himself, he still bears the demeanor of a proud and defiant victor. "I won't tell you a thing. And you won't lay a hand on me... or I'll say His Name." The Sidereal's eyes bore into those of the Solars, levelling a challenge. "The name that'll destroy this city." He pauses, then adds just one more thing. "I'm leaving now."

"Why did you side with Them?" demands Egress. "You are one of the Chosen! The preservation of Creation is your only reason for being, yet you have run to the aid of those who would tear it asunder! What did you hope to gain? Has your master run you too hard? Is your greatness not gaining you enough followers? What are you, anyway? Tell me, why should I even believe someone who stinks so heavily of arrogance and treachery knows anything to hold back my hand? Where exactly do you think you can hide from the wrath of Yu-Shan and the Deliberative?"

"Where? Wherever I wish." The young man's eyes flicker from their starry pattern to another, similar vision - a depth of emptiness that Egress witnessed once before as Gallius, when her patron showed her the sights of the Primordials whirling in their endless night. "I'm now Chosen of Another Power."

"The power of the defeated. The power of madness, of hopelessness," replies Egress evenly. "You follow a banner whose victory means your death, whose salvation shall damn you. If your confidence in your new masters is so great, what stays your tongue?" she asks. "Ah yes, you are not up to any even fight, are you? After all, they did not do so well in the last battle, did they? Your masters hold you back even now. Are you of so much worth that they truly will risk it all for you? One lonely, forsaken soul."

"We found you once, Arnon," says Davron quietly. "We _will_ find you again. Submit now, and you may be shown mercy." There's a little empty bravado in that threat - but only a little. It may take years or decades or longer, to be sure, but Davron has no doubt of the _eventual_ outcome.

_I know the secrets of the most powerful sorcery known to Creation, and yet here I am, helpless, held in thrall by a single name. I can do nothing to stop the murderer. He escapes._ Ramar regards Arnon with a cold gaze, "You start down a path that will only end in your doom. You have but one chance to change this. Do not cast it aside."

Davron says nothing more aloud, but directs a thought to his spirit ring. It's the only thing he can think to do. _Yang... do you know any way to silence this man before he can speak a word?_

"You are Chosen," says Chi-Yosh, "Not for what you hold inside of you, not for your potential, but for that which you lack. You are opportunity. A pawn for a tendril. You are not ready for the Time of the End, and neither are your masters."

The corrupted Sidereal grins, sharklike. "I have no words, and you have nothing _but_ words." He begins moving his hands gracefully, gathering Essence together, shaping a spell...
