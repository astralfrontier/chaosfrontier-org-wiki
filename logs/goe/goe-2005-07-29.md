# Gods of Eden 2005-07-29

It is the last day of a tumultuous, eventful, and ultimately ominous Calibration. As with any year, these five days have brought chaos, change and disorder to the lives of everyone in Creation. This year differs only in intensity, not nature.

There is an emergency session of the Sidereals, and the Solar Circle are invited to attend - but not participate.

The Priestess, and members of the Inner Circle, have drawn up an agreement, and this is the first item on the Sidereal agenda. They will not interfere with Solar activity in the Threshold, but they demand that the Deliberative recognize the role of the Realm in the fate of the world - the Great Houses and the other powers active on the Blessed Isle may be manipulated, wheedled, convinced, connived, or outright coerced, but they should not be destroyed unless necessary.

Egress listens to the terms and finds them reasonable enough. She has plenty of room to do what must be done. There are many forces coming to bear against the Realm. It is time to put it in its place. The Dragon Bloods will rule it, but they will learn to bow to the Deliberative, the rightful masters of Creation, or examples shall be made to make it painfully clear who really rules.

The matter comes, too, to the question of the Steersman's replacement. It develops that there is a candidate, and only the Maiden of Secrets' power holds the spark back from this individual. It develops further that he is joined by several other people - all sharing some unspecified quality - and that they will be ushered into the meeting shortly.

---

Approximately fifteen people are shown in the meeting room. The Solars hover around the periphery, backs to the wood-panelled walls that are carved into murals of the accomplishments of Heaven's agents through history. They look down the gentle slope of the room, over the heads of the Chosen of the Stars, examining the newcomers. None look particularly notable, at first glance - average men and women, mortals all.

"We've spoken before," the Priestess says to one of them, a larger man with a determined expression in his gaze. He nods, fidgeting uncomfortably and glancing at his left hand from time to time. Whispers pass between the Sidereals gathered here, and a consensus of sorts seems to be in motion.

The moment comes, and a brilliant light suddenly engulfs the stranger. The softer hues of the rainbow caress his husky build, dancing off his fingertips and arcing from them to jab at those nearest him. The others shrink back in sudden, inexplicable fear, but he stands rigid and quiet. The moment passes; the relatively subtle Exaltation of the Sidereals has come upon him. "You are the Steersman now," the Priestess intones, and the others nod in agreement.

"No.. " These are the first words the new Exalt speaks, and they are strangely calm - like a rock, he has weathered this new experience and come out unruffled. He glances around, seeking the eyes of someone, and hesitates before speaking further. "I am the Storyteller now. I have someone I need to go talk to..." And he steps out of the center of the room, making a beeline for the Solars.

Egress remains quiet, watching this new Sidereal-for he must have just been exalted-and wondering just what it is that is about to pass. The Storyteller? This is strange, indeed.

Chi-Yosh watches the Exaltation of the Sidereal unfold. So different than that of the Solars. Though, this one may be unique, not the stressful moments often experienced by most Chosen of the Dawn's experience. The Storyteller? Things have begun to change... Change indeed. The Su'Katan leans close, further piqued.

Davron reflects quietly. _We were invited to attend - and now this new Chosen, this Storyteller, comes to talk with us personally. I understand better now **why** we are invited - we were fated to be here. But by whose design, I wonder?_

"I hear you guys are the big noises around here," the Storyteller says, drawing close and waving. He seems more like the Ronin than Chejop Kejak's divine heir - a man walking in the valley, not a man standing on the hilltop. "So what's it like?"

Davron laughs. "Noises, indeed. I suppose we _have_ made rather a lot of noise around here, of late. What's it like?" he says, scratching his chin. "Well... it's just being who we are, I suppose."

"Yeah, but... that's what I mean," the Chosen explains. "Who are you?"

Egress for a time simply stares back at the Storyteller. "I am Egress, Zenith Caste, Chosen of the Unconquered Sun. I am the one who was drawn back across the veil. There is much I must do yet, and your wisdom is going to guide me in many things, Storyteller. Until the mountain grinds to dust or I die finally, I am the Heirophant of the Deliberative and peacebroker among the Celestials."

The man lets out a long whistle. "Sounds impressive," he replies after a few seconds, digesting this introduction. "If you're looking for wisdom, I think you're going to be let down. I don't even know what the hell I'm supposed to do here. So help me out."

"Ah," says Chi-Yosh, "But someone who has never experienced can be wise to those who are in their rut. You don't know how to think about the things we take for granted. Fresh ideas can turn a stagnant pool into a slow but steady river to a raging torrent."

"Right now I feel more like an iceberg," the nascent Sidereal replies ruefully.

Davron takes a little longer to think about this one. "I... let's see. There's a lot about myself I've yet to learn. I suppose I'm an iceberg too - more beneath the surface than I've seen yet." He rubs his chin again. "But what I do know is this. I'm a craftsman, and a defender of what I hold dear. I seek knowledge and wisdom - not of everything, but just what I need to do my job. I want to see people safe, protected from those who would do them harm. Helios has given me a few skills to help do that directly, but more than that he's given me the ability to make the tools that others can use to build that safe shelter."

"The power of Exaltation does not instantly make one aware of their path," says Egress calmly. "It is only the means to walk it, when your feet find it, and the impulse to know it when it comes." She pauses, studying this Sidereal closely for a time, "I would say you are not what I expected, but I truly had no certain expectation. It is far too early to say just what shall come to pass, but know that you were meant to be here. Step carefully, but have faith in yourself. A great weight lies upon us all, but now we at least bear it together."

"I've been told a lot of bullshit by these guys back here." The Storyteller jerks his thumb over his shoulder at his fellow Sidereals, and their internal murmuring grows louder at this audible revelation. "They know what they're doing. They...." He searches a moment for the right words. "They don't know WHY they do it. Does that make sense?"

Chi-Yosh considers before offering, "Do you mean that they do not see the forest for the trees?"

The Storyteller thinks about this. "More like... they're loggin' it all to build a house that nobody's drawn up plans for, you know?"

Davron says, "Ahh. So they _do_ know they want to build a house, but they don't know how it'll be put together?"

"I think the nature of Sidereals is too alien to easily comprehend," says Egress. "They are guided by things that make little sense to mortals. I do not envy them their task. The Solars at least still primarily are concerned with people and tangible things. The Sidereals are.. hmm. They see the forest and care nothing for the trees, you might say."

The Storyteller nods a bit. "Yeah. So, the title of 'Steersman' was pretty meaningless. What we're here to do, what I've been _told_ we're doing at least, is managing the tale-spinning that keeps your world going. We're the narrators, the writers. Thus, Storyteller."

"Better than 'The Newbie Dumbass', my backup choice," he adds.

Chi-Yosh can't contain his grin. "Sidereals seem to be advisors. The advise you seem to have, I can appreciate, even if your peers do not. The words may be blunt but the message is on target."

Egress is rather taken aback. The language is far from what she has heard in some time. As queen, she's rarely spoken to in such words. She will just try to stick to business, at least. "So, Storyteller, do you know of the Deliberative? Do you know what we are trying to do?" Perhaps he will jump onboard and force all the Sidereals to follow suit..

The man smiles at the compliment, then stops to listen to Egress. He seems reserved, untrained, not so much humble as plainspoken - he is crude, but not rude. "I know what I've been told. Let's hear a new version of it. And show me where I can get some food around here."

---

Once the explanations about the new movement of the Deliberative are underway, and the Storyteller is taken around Heaven to gawk and talk, Chi-Yosh offers one last bit of advise, knowing that the new Sidereal leader is likely up to his eyes in helpful advise all ready. The spirits of Heaven, the clerks and messangers and lower grunts are a well of information, and see the mechanism of Yu-Shan from the bottom up, not from the top down where most Sidereal see things. The perspective of the spirits might be more refreshing than fanciful dressing and words of webweaving.

This advice is taken agreeably, although it's hard to get the man to pay attention some of the time - the miracles of Yu-Shan are enough to hold his attention quite solidly, and he must sometimes physically be escorted away from the more fabulous displays of magical prowess.

Egress' lesson rather specific and direct. She focuses on the matter at hand most of all. "There are no new enemies we face, truly," she begins. "We have defeated them all before. They are just finding new weapons to use and we must adapt with them." She rolls out a map then of Creation from the First Age. "This is what was just before the Solars failed and were laid low by the Sidereals and their Dragon Blood allies." She waits a moment, then casts down another map near it, showing what is known by all here, but is far harder to accept when seen on paper. "This is what the Wyld has left of Creation." She then begins to gesture to many points on the map, naming various places of horror and madness, all large Shadowlands that she has learned of from the Lunars and other Solars and Sidereals. "These are the lands stolen from us by the dead."

Know these things, but also remember that every place, even those nameless places that find their way to no map, have a value and a beauty. Every life has worth in itself. The Sidereals seem to train hard to forget this." Egress sighs softly and shakes her head. "They must try to remember. We must not just save Creation, but protect the people who give it meaning."

"Yeah.. we got some guys from where I come from who say the same thing. Just that they end up getting killed every time," the Storyteller murmurs, a hint of melancholy creeping into his voice.

"Perhaps I shall get killed," murmurs Egress. "It does not matter. I have already done the hard part. I believe that even if I am struck down now the flame I have lit shall burn on. The Unconquered Sun will see to it." She laughs suddenly, "But I am not dead. Not now. My fire burns on and with it I will kindle all the hearts in Creation."

The Storyteller's Riverspeak is even and educated, but he is not a native speaker. Now he engages in a quiet aside in a tongue the Solars have not heard in a long time indeed: English. "Great, another religious nut. But they're supposed to be demigods anyway, so maybe they're entitled...." He shrugs, continuing in Riverspeak. "So you guys were regular humans before, right?"

Egress pauses for a moment, then speaks first in English, then again in Riverspeak, "You speak English? How can that be?" She won't mention the 'nut' part. She'll have to see about that later!

Davron laughs in surprised delight. Since Egress seems too dumbstruck by this happenstance, he will answer the question. "Yes, we were. Some of us a little more special than others - Egress here was a mortal princess, for example - but not especially touched by the gods. At least, as far as we knew at the time."

"English is my native language," the man explains. He glances from face to face. "Oh, I bet they didn't tell you," he adds with the smile of dawning realization. "You saw those guys in there with me? The group? The guy who was in my job before me, Chejop Kejak? Looks like he had some kind of standing orders or request or something, to have people from my world brought here if something-or-other happened. You guys call it Gaia."

"Some sort of pact with the Mother-Goddess, they could invoke it up to three times, and this was one of them."

Davron looks intrigued. "Did he? I wonder why. If this was worth invoking the pact for, there was a reason. Wonder what that wily old coot was up to."

Chi-Yosh asides to the Storyteller, "Every spark comes stamped with 'Authorized by Patron God'. So every Exalt is just an extension of that god. The-" He pauses short and must now process this. Such an interesting safeguard. "We have seen Gaia. The food is very mild. Very nice to visit however."

The Storyteller nods. "Well, I did learn something. He needed people like us for the Second Prophecy. That was the first thing I was told about. I don't know _why_, but there's supposed to be records. I intend to find them."

---

The Priestess, alone in her chambers when the Solars call, is fuming. "I can't believe it!" she shouts. "He's... he's... totally wrong!" Some sort of burden has lifted from the woman's shoulders, and she almost seems to have been infected with the openness the Storyteller demonstrated. She's pacing nervously, looking up only when the group arrives, and she strides forward. "You... you saw that, right?" she demands.

"I saw the Sidereals select a new Steersman," says Egress. "Only to get a Storyteller instead. If you trust fate, you know this was meant to be." She finds it rather ironic that the Priestess is demonstrating so little of that virtue at the moment. Still, she should show some respect to this woman if she is to mould her into an advisor. "Why do you believe he is wrong, Priestess?"

"He lacks any sort of gravity. He lacks respect for what we do, and who we are. If he is accorded any significant role in the Deliberative, the whole enterprise is doomed!" she cries out, waving her hands and their magnificently-jeweled fingers in the air. Then, in a deliberate and difficult effort, she visibly calms herself. "I remember that I think of you Solars as maniacs, and even you have shown yourselves.. suitable to work with, under positive circumstances. I will be patient. I apologize for my outburst." With that said, she has regained herself, again all statuesque and commanding. Then a small smile plays upon her lips, and she grows somewhat more intimate in her speech. "I beg you. Consider this a token of our alliance. I would never reveal myself in such a way to people I distrusted."

Egress laughs softly and smiles, raising a hand to touch two fingers to her lips. "None shall hear of it, then. Yes, he is far from what I expected, and I must admit even I thought at first you had played some horrible joke on us, but it may be that in the end, he is the ideal one for this task." She sighs softly, "I have no choice really but to believe that. He is the one that the Chosen have found for this task. Why should I question them now that they have made their choice? It is my task to see to it that the new Stee.. the Storyteller succeeds."

The Priestess nods. "I am glad to announce we have also settled on an Enigma. It seems that fate does indeed move in mysterious ways."

"That was rather fast work," says Egress. "But time is running short in any case. It is fate. We are finding those we need most precisely when they are required. I imagine that is something that the Sidereals are accustomed to. It will take some time to adjust." Egress nods and suggests, "I think I should share my ideas with you now. I see many challenges, but I think you will agree that they will sate the Lunars and prevent any need to destroy the Great Houses."

The Priestess nods. "Speak on," she invites, and with a gesture she indicates a quill-pen on her table. This pen rises, animated by the will of the Sidereal, revealing itself as a slender construct of jade. It begins to write as she continues. "I will bring your record to the others when we are ready."

"The Realm must exist as it does, but it has grown too wild, to haughty and sure of itself. The Dragon Blooded are not the rightful rulers of Creation. The changes that we see now make it clear that the time of the Celestials has returned, and that the Lunars, Sidereals, and Solars are destined to rule Creation once more. Now, it has been said to me by many that the Realm must be preserved to avoid a terrible fate, and I do not doubt this. I do not doubt the Great Houses must be preserved. I believe the Great Houses should take their orders from the Deliberative, however. In one way or another I feel this must be achieved. The Lunars will be far more eager to join us if the current rulers of the Realm are put in their place, so to speak. If some examples must be made, I am sure it can be arranged."

"The Great Houses as they stand are weak, selfish, and terribly blind to what we now know," says Egress. "The Sidereals have far better things to do than rebuild them directly. That is a job for the Solars. A way must be opened to restore them to full strength. With that restoration we can begin the great change that I see as a requirement. Show them first that we are of use. Let us use words and deeds to inspire them and let us use our power to greatly increase their ability to guard the Blessed Isle. It makes no sense to squander this time of weakness. If we act together I am confident that we can use the abilities of the Solars with the guidance of the Sidereals and finally regain the control needed over the Realm."

The Priestess nods slowly. "It will be difficult. And we must consider the effects it will have on the election of the Scarlet Empress."

The woman speaks further. "For the last seven centuries, the Scarlet Empress - and the Steersman with her - worked to ensure that the apparatus of the Realm was dependent upon her existence. Whatever happens, whoever sits on the throne will be the single most powerful entity in the Realm. Yes, even greater than the Great Houses as they are now, because she is one of the very few people who could make the Great Houses cooperate in matters they don't wish to. She is the nexus around which the politics of the Realm swirl, and even if you conquer the outermost of those waters, you must still overcome the challenge she represents."

"There is just one flaw in the Scarlett Empress," says Egress. "The Steersman who made her formidible is dead and his replacement has abdicated that throne." She stares off for a moment, "I wish to know more about the current state of the Realm and which candidates appear the most viable for the role of Empress. I fear her omnipotence is going to vanish. I also believe that something must be done to keep the Deathlords away from her. I do not find the words of Mask of Winters comforting. He spoke too casually about the last empress being a puppet."

"We will have a report ready on that within a few weeks' time," the Priestess replies. "As to the Deathlords.... I cannot say."

"We will have to settle with them first among our enemies," says Egress softly. "I fear a great dark tide shall rise when that time comes. We must delay that day and weaken them in what ways we can. The proper burial of the fallen is the start. The ritual has spread across the Nation and is spilling over our borders. I only hope that more see that rite done correctly." She turns back to the Priestess then, "I do not believe I can be both Queen of the Nation of the Sun and Hierophant in a time like this. I am as of yet unsure who to name my Steward, however. What do you suggest?"

The Priestess shrugs slightly. "Better to ask a more... secular adviser in this matter," she recommends. "But if you trust the men under you, organize them into a council. The Deliberative must obviously take priority."

"I do trust them," says Egress. "I just do not wish to fail them in this last act." She sighs quietly and pushes away the question she wishes to ask. No one can know if she shall ever retake her throne again. "I am glad you are going to help me, Priestess," she says abruptly. "I think for the time, we must plan to change the Realm and to use Solar gifts to strengthen it. The Wyld Hunt is going to do a great deal of work for us. It is going to help remove those Solars who wish to act against the will of the Deliberative, after all."

"You have seen it, haven't you," the woman replies coolly. "You see in your mind how the world can be made right. You see the blind, blundering efforts of your newly-Exalted peers. You see that they cannot see, and the weight of correcting them.. you feel that too, do you not?"

"Yes, I do," answers Egress calmly. "I see many things. Since the Steersman died, I have felt more and more that eyes are focused upon me. I feel that I am meant to.. hmm. It is hard to say without sounding foolishly overproud. I just feel that I can see what should be. I do not yet know how to get there, but I feel that I know the best way for things to turn in the end. I cannot see fate, but I trust it to guide me there."

"I believe that at last we understand each other," the woman murmurs, smiling.

As Egress designs the forward mechanisms of the Deliberative, Chi-Yosh excuses himself and draws towards the hub of the investigation into Chejop's murder. It has thus become a man hunt with Lions, Exalts and Spirits alike looking and feeling through Heaven. The search is for the murderer, a potential exit created by ambrosia, and a means to handle him once he is found. Thus far, all three goals have yet been met. Yu-Shan is a large city of wonders, and some of those magnificent things can prove an unmaking for the others.
