# Gods of Eden 2005-08-05

While the others busy themselves searching for the fugitive Arnon, Ramar seeks a means to deal with the villain once found. _For an individual to render an entire city powerless by means of a single word... it is dangerous enough for someone uncorrupted to know such things..._ While thoughts such as this tumble through his head, he makes his way towards the Division of Secrets. His thoughts wander back through the days as he approaches, _I know the day your deliberative will end. And that day is not today._

The Black Puppet Mask is in a conference with his colleague Nara-o. The two senior gods are perhaps the most sinister beings in Yu-Shan, if any credence can be given to the rumors that swirl around the Bureau of Destiny. One in charge of all the secrets of Fate, the other in charge of the eventual destruction of all things. Nevertheless, a messenger-cherub is dispatched to the inner sanctum of the Division, and the God of Silence, Wayang, emerges to meet with his guest in due course. As usual he is nothing more than a silhouette in black, marred only by two glowing yellow eyes, although it is whispered with dread that he had adopted less mentionable forms when roused to anger.

He gestures, and Ramar finds that the inky void of his body and the sickly yellow of his eyes carry more meaning than any spoken word. It is similar to sleeping alone in darkness - when one's eyes see nothing, one's ears become more sensitive. The Solar finds himself attending to each small motion, each hint of body language the god exhibits, and he discovers that his ability to 'read' this being can more or less substitute for listening to him speak. _Sit down,_ Wayang indicates, as the two stand in the quiet gardens of the Division of Secrets. His curiosity is clear - _What have you come to speak to me about?_

Ramar stands reverently in the gardens of Secrets. His attention is swallowed by the inky void that is Wayang. His thoughts in turn, aid his comprehension of the creature's method of communication. The Solar regards the yellow eyes, and communicates. At first he speaks, though his words are thunderous in this silent garden. "Words," he answers, "Of power."

It is a difficult task, speaking without words, though Ramar will not let it go untried. Now and then loud words must help convey his thoughts, keep him articulate, though slowly but surely the silence begins to gain a foothold. "It's about Arnon..." _He holds a word that can end this city._ "Others, meanwhile," _know words that can bring about other... wonders and perils. I am looking for a way to break their power. A word that can end the power of other words. Something so strong even terrible names hold no sway in it's presence._

Though Ramar does not speak everything he thinks, Wayang knows. The ancient god cannot help but be aware of the situation. Perhaps he is aware of the secret weapon Arnon professes to wield as well. He is certainly aware of his own nature. His implacable gaze seems to soften somewhat as he moves. _Very well. I will teach you something of this lore._ All is quiet, and Ramar finds that he is no longer in the garden he remembers. The soft, tranquilizing silence numbed his senses for a moment, and he has no memory of how he came to be in this ill-lit library full of dust-laden tomes. Wayang, nigh-invisible in the gloom, walks carefully across the floor and leaves no sound. He stops at one of the many bookshelves around the room and draws out a volume, extending it for inspection.

Ramar glances around the ill-lit library, senses readjusting to this new sensation. He tries to focus on Wayang, though it puts a strain on even his sharp senses. He follows across the floor, treading as quietly as he can, and inspects the volume proffered.

'The Book of Night And Moon', the title reads. The front cover opens, dislodging a cloud of dust into the air, and Ramar examines it. Wayang waits, patiently, unnatural eyes glowing in the twilight.

The Book purports to be the record of the Primordials and their creation of the world, as it was translated from the writings of the ancient and now lost Dragon Kings. Even the introduction makes the Solar shudder, for it hints of ages and ages of time that passed before the Primordial War between the gods, their chosen champions, and the forces of their makers. And it talks of the precursor of sorcery - Ren, the Name Art.

Before the gift of sorcery was given to the Exalted, and before they had fully mastered their Charms, they used another magic. The true names of the gods and their creations could be called upon, and invested with Essence. It was a primal, dangerous, mad way to work magic. But it was powerful, and the technique of it was refined in time. Still, it was forgotten - left behind as the Exalted came into their own. It called on powers outside the Exalted's own strength, and so did not grow as they grew.

The sparks of Exaltation were the final, ultimate product of Ren. Rather than the Name of their chosen gods, the Exalted could finally tap their power directly. And when that happened, the Book says, the Names were forgotten.

The first thing Ramar becomes aware of, is that his hands are shaking. For a while, he had become so lost in the book, so lost learning things which had been lost to history, to myths... that for a second his mind could comprehend nothing but these new truths-incorporating them into his thoughts, his beliefs. "I..." he manages, shattering the silence. When his mind stops reeling, he looks at Wayang, _What has become of such Names?_

Wayang shrugs. An unaccountable breeze flows through the darkened library, and the book's pages flip of their own accord to another section. Ramar finds himself staring down at the five hundred and fifty-five secret names of Luna. _They exist.. if you know where to look,_ the god's pose implies.

There's a nod, followed by a glance from Ramar that hopefully indicates, _I understand._ He reads over the secret names of Luna, and something occurs to him. A questioning shrug conveys _but where does one look... and..._ "How do you learn what each name does?"

_The names are titles that hold power. Black Puppet Mask is my open name, but I have another one - Messenger of the Last Dying Echo._ Ramar finds that he feels words forming from the god, despite his continued stony silence. _All names have that which is spoken and that which is not. You will know what power a name has, and how to recognize a true name, by hearing the part not spoken._

_Stay with me, and I will teach you the Name you desire._

Egress has settled herself at a location temporarily borrowed to her to handle the beginning of the new Deliberative. Around her are scattered many pages of spidery hand-writing and more flowing prose. Most of it was not written by her hand, but all of it is very much her concern. She raises a hand and crooks a finger at one of the many spirits standing ready about her. A slip of paper is offered to it. "Find these Exalts and ask them to meet the Heirophant in two hours time." She frowns thoughtfully. The first group are those she wishes to help prepare for the taking of Denandsor. Their task is not the only one, and Egress is not even certain it is the most important. Who can tell what fate will favor?

A second time she raises a hand, gesturing to another spirit. "Call these to me in four hours time," she says. She considers for a moment, nodding thoughtfully. She murmurs aloud, "And these shall be the hunters of the Dragon Kings.." If even half of them will aid her, she will honestly be surprised. She idly wonders if the first Deliberative faced such a situation. The thought does not bother her for long, for again she gestures, holding up a slip of paper. "These should meet me in six hours, if they are willing. The builders, who will make us a new city to stand as a rally point against the spreading madness and darkness." Some of the most impressive sorcerors of the age have their names on that paper. She can only hope some shall aid the Deliberative.

The fourth time she raises her hand and presents the last list, "And these shall come as they wish, when they will it." The most pressing issue among the Sidereals is what to do concerning the Realm. This list consists of names only of Solars and Lunars known to have a strong interest in the Realm. In particular those who are not eager to aid the new Deliberative. What must be done to win them is what Egress is most interested in learning. And what must be done to avoid infuriating them is important, as well.

Some will answer the call. None can leave Heaven yet, for the question of the Dark Star - Arnon - remains open. However, they can prepare. One Solar, a stocky warrior wearing red and gold, came to Heaven with a jade-bearing Dragon-Blooded companion in tow. He and his companion form the nucleus of the party to enter Rathess, for he was once a tomb-robber in a past life. Elsewhere, the Lunar called Hellspike is exhorting some of his most valorous - and if truth be told, drunkenly reckless - Lunar companions to brave Denandsor. He tells of the rumor of Raksi's duel there, taunting them and calling out their courage.

Kahime, the young Solar princess of the frozen North, will travel to the Northeast with Yurgen and Samea. The crusty Icewalker chief still has his enemies among the Fair Folk to deal with, but he has heard tell of more First Age flight engines buried beneath the ice. Such things will be valuable in any effort to make a flying fortress, much less an entire city.

Others meet and gather some of the things Egress has proposed, and Egress in turn learns something of their plans. And in two hours she has learned the first lesson that the Deliberative taught itself when it was formed - that to secure cooperation among the Celestials, one must pique their interest first, and appeal to their heart second.

With the rather shaky start of things, Egress is eager to at last get back with her friends, whom she feels have a lot more solidarity than all the strangers she's been forced to draw together. Once everyone is gathered again, she begins speaking of one of her gravest concerns. "At the center of all issues is the fate of the Realm," she begins. "There are a few paths we can realistically consider at this point, and each has a cost, I have learned."

"The first path is to continue what has been, which is to create yet another false Empress and force order into the teeth of the Realm's chaos. The cost of this is to perpetuate a lie and to put off the day of unification indefinitely. It is however the easiest path and promises the quickest stability, as I see it." She goes on after sighing almost dreamily, "The second path is to select a new Empress of our choice, but to enforce at many levels of the Realm's leadership that Celestials are the true masters of Creation and that they must do as we instruct them. This is more risky, but it hastens the restoration of the proper order in Creation. It begins the end of the Immaculate Lie."

Again she sighs and goes on, "The third choice is to take the Realm back as a possession of the Deliberative. This has the greatest risk, as it will likely rouse the Deathlords from their uneasy slumber, or so I have been warned. It may well be true. Whether that would be disaster of wisdom is impossible to say. It is now a race. Who can grow stronger before we come to blows. That is the real question. However, that is not the question for now. What would you do? What position is best for Creation? I believe the Empress at least must know the truth, as well as those who stand highest among her. If we do not curb the Wyld Hunt we will lose the support of many Lunars."

Chi-Yosh leans back in his seat. "The question is also 'who will the Realm follow'? So long has the Imperial Isle heard the Immaculate Lie, that they will not simply roll over and agree to be ruled by the Deliberative so swiftly. A sledgehammer cannot bring down the centuries of work laid by the Sidereal. Would the Realm accept an Empress who held her allegance to Solars? Or would they even know?" A waivering gesture of the hand. "A strong leader who can handle the necessities of the Realm would be useful, accepting our orders as directed but otherwise paving her own path. IT would allow the Deliberative to focus on other matters rather than watching the Great House politics too closely. Let the Sidereal handle that."

"I agree. It seems that the safest path, to leave things as they are, cannot be taken. It is an easy route to safety. The third path is an easy route to the end we would like. Such transitions take time." Ramar nods, indicating his preference for the second path. "It seems to me that if we begin to end the lies of the past, in doing so we can build a slow power... something so subtle as to keep our... enemies from realizing the true threat to themselves."

"The second path is meant to be very subtle and secretive," says Egress. "The rulers only would know of us. As for the particular person to be selected, we have our first criteria if this is our desire: they must be able to see and accept their true role in Creation. They have to understand who the real enemy is, as well. I think the Realm knows something of the danger of the Deathlords, at least. The trick will be supporting the Realm with the strength of the Celestials without being noticed. I think we should protect the Realm and only with Celestial support can prepare it for the demands of this coming age. I fear, my friends, that a most terrible age of war is coming. It is the same battle we have always fought, however. I do not know that it will ever truly end."

Davron's brain is still half full of flying engines, and is slow to reply. "You all know I've had a hard time following politics - I've generally left it to those of you who have the skill," he begins, nodding to Egress and Ramar. "If you ask me what I'd rather have, I'd say to take back the Realm entirely. But wisdom is what tells you you can't have what you want Right Now, or at least that you can keep what you want if you put it off." He sighs. "All the same, we must wean the Realm off their hatred of the Anathema, if we're to accomplish anything useful without having to look over our shoulder to the Blessed Isle every time we walk down the street."

"Indeed." Ramar ponders things thoughtfully, "It is time to shed the title of Anathema, and pass the word on to those who are more... deserving of it. Those who actually are cursed, condemned."

Egress nods thoughtfully. She turns to the Priestess, "In many things, we must turn to the Sidereals for advice. In some things, however, we are likely to diverge from them. I think the second path, of slow, cautious spread of the truth is best. The tales of the Solars are spreading like wildfire through the east, south, north, and perhaps even what remains of the west. The Realm will find it hard to suppress what is said and what is seen. We must be careful or we might spark a religious uprising of a most unacceptable nature." Egress looks thoughtful for a moment and says, "Priestess. Would it be possible for me to speak with the Dragons themselves? Would they be able to help right things? I imagine there would be a price for such aid, but I might be able to pay it, as I have paid for things in the past."

The woman turns slightly pale, but nods. "They could be spoken to, but I beg you.. do not incite them. There is a reason they do not appear at our festivals in Yu-Shan, and there is ample excuse why they do not personally show themselves in the dreams of their followers."

"But is there no other way to achieve what you need?"

"It is the way that seems to be best," says Egress. "I can only be what and who I am, Priestess. I believe that they do not wish for their chosen to fail in this time of need. I believe that the Dragons know what must be done as clearly as any, and I believe they know that only the Celestials working with their Chosen can achieve it." Egress nods decisively, "I must learn more of them, but I truly cannot imagine that they do not see the need of this hour."

"Then come and see what makes the Dragon-Blooded who they are."

---

In the chambers of the Bureau of Humanity hangs a great map. The shadows of five dragons hang over it - one each for the four corners, and a fifth curled around the Imperial Mountain and stretching its mighty wings out across the entire Blessed Isle.

"Some look at this picture and think it a quaint piece of mythological representation," the Priestess says. "Behold.." She gestures to the South to begin with, at the line of mountains that border it, so curiously reminiscent of the outlines of dragon's wings. Then to the West, drawing the Circle's attention to the sinuous, almost serpentine chain of islands. "Do you think these shapes of land are an accident?" she asks, calmly.

"I imagined they were crafted to appear as they do by the Dragons themselves," replies Egress. "Of all the gods, it seems I know the least of the Dragons, save what their elements reveal of them. A reflection of their nature, perhaps, and nothing more."

"Perhaps it is because they are embodied by the Dragons themselves," suggests Ramar, tracing the outlines with his gaze.

"Just as your patron god hangs in the sky, the Dragons lie coiled under the earth. Their least whiskers we call singularly tall trees; their spines are the mountain ranges; their blood is the rivers. But unlike the Unconquered Sun, the Dragons are... more closely tied to their physical incarnations, and cannot easily leave them. But they can be approached, and questioned. Still, their rage would be the rending of mountains and valleys, or tidal waves that destroyed nations along the coast." The Priestess speaks softly. "Through them, Essence gathers and flows. It pours into the souls of the Dragon-Blooded, the Terrestrial Exalted, and it gives them the power to reproduce their divine heritage."

"Which is why the currents of elemental Essence which flow through the world are known as dragon tracks," says Davron, pondering the map from this new perspective. "They are the Essence-flows of the Dragons themselves, whose confluences give us the sites where Manses can be built."

"What is the best way to avoid angering them?" asks Egress. "Mine is not the speech of the gods. I can only speak from the perspective of the Exalted. Of those who stand and see the day for what it is. We are encircled by enemies, not even counting the newest threat, which remains utterly evasive."

"Come in numbers. Speak in prayers. They are not beings you converse with. When the time is right, we will teach you the prayers to use. Do not perform them alone."

"The gods are not like humans," Davron says, nodding in agreement. "And the embodiments of the primal elements of our universe less so than many. I know for certain that _I_ would not rouse them without someone to teach me their ways, as best as they could be understood."

"Their very nature makes them so unapproachable," says Chi-Yosh. "The spirits and elementals are a sliver of the Dragons' power, and they can be talked to. But the Dragons themselves are what make Creation's elements real, just as Helios brings light to the world. And like the power of nature they are untamed, only understood by their patterns and laws."

Egress nods thoughtfully. "There is one other thing I wish to ask of you. All of you." She sighs deeply, this time with unquestionable sadness. "Do you believe that Alcis of Greyfalls will be able and willing to stand as the steward of the Nation of the Sun? I do not know when I shall rule there again." Behind her words is a clear hint that Egress does not believe she ever shall. "I cannot be both Heirophant and Queen. I must focus on all of Creation now, though my people will always be precious to me. That dream must be surrendered."

Chi-Yosh gazes upon Egress solemnly. "You have served the Nation of the Sun as its inspiration and hope, its conviction and determination, its voice and mother. Can you say that Alcis can do these things? She has managed Greyfalls successfully, but being a Queen is not just making sure all is in order."

"It is a difficult thing to let go, Egress... but perhaps your dream isn't over. Look at it this way..." Ramar considers his words carefully. His recent experience with silence still resonates heavily in his being. "A mother, a good mother, raises her children and prepares them for life in the world. Even when they are grown and moved on, she cares for them still... guides them, offers what she can. Perhaps, as the Nation of the Sun grows, you cannot guide it as you have, but you need not abandon it. Keep it in your heart, do not be afraid to show your love for your people, and they will weather whatever life has in store for them. They will grow."

Egress smiles at Ramar. "I do not think I can help but keep it in my heart, really." She grows more serious once more, saying to the Priestess, "Will you look into this selection and see what Destiny has to say of this? I trust my heart, but I trust your vision no less, and would like to see both used to full effect in this."

The Priestess nods slowly. "I'll consult with the Outlander," she says.

"Thank you," replies Egress quietly. "Other than that, I think we have only one thing left to deal with, and it is a situation whose answer I believe lies with the one we have yet to meet, upon which so much of the future will hang." She need not say the title Enigma to make it clear what she means.

Marina sits in the brightly-lit playroom. Some of the walls have bookshelves or tables abutting them, but on almost every open space has been hung a drawing or painting of some kind. The illustrations are crude and child-like, for their author is the very child that sits on Marina's lap as the Solar negotiator reads a story from a thin, brightly-colored book.

The story is a simple legend, the Story of Pao the Restless, a wandering monk and martial artist who bested spirits and greedy merchants. Marina reads it lightly, using her trained voice to enhance the pleasure of the child's fable. And little Mallisen, heir of the small kingdom of Syllum - or what once was a kingdom before the Nation of the Sun absorbed it - listens attentively.

The girl cocks her head, then hops off the woman's lap and runs to the door just as it opens. The Priestess smiles, nodding gently at the girl, then more coldly - but still politely enough - at her storyteller. The Sidereal steps aside, gesturing for Egress and the other members of the Circle to enter. "The Enigma," she says, by way of introduction, her hand gesturing at the girl.

"Through the Master, we learned that this child had been visited by a ghost from Gaia," the Priestess says. "She saw through you, saw enough to draw suns over your heads." At this she points to one of the pictures hanging on the wall, and Davron, Ramar and Chi-Yosh see themselves as of a year or more ago, depicted through the all-too-understanding eyes of a child. "She has something we cannot define, and that is what we seek out..."

Egress considers for a moment, wearing for that time the most dire and serious of expressions. It cannot last. Finally, a most joyous, warm laughter spills from her lips as she does not bow, but steps forward to kneel in front of the Enigma. "Well, this is not what I expected, but it is wonderful." She considers for a time and reaches out to brush her fingers through the child's hair, "Were you enjoying Marina's story?" she asks quietly.

Little Mallisen nods quickly. "Yes ma'am," she says, in a polite tone of voice. Her breeding and good education show through, despite her youth, and she giggles a little at the contact with her hair. "I'm very pleased to see you all again," she adds and curtseys to the other members of the Circle.

Ramar just laughs, and staggers back carefully. He looks stunned, "I... heh..." Articulate, to be certain. "It's good to see you again," he adds, and bows, for good measure.

The playroom is located in the Celestial City; Mallisen must have been brought here before Arnon's revelation. "I spoke with the water lady," the girl adds, now looking at Chi-Yosh. "She wants to know when you are going to come visit her again."

Chi-Yosh's face is warm with a smile like dawn. "I am glad we will be seeing you more, Mallisen." For a moment the Dawn is silent, before a rueful chuckle escapes him. "When I can. She is a tranquil pool amid the stormy waters to come. I had hoped she might have been here at Calibration."

"She says she wants to come with you when you go sailing. She said she got permission to leave her pool. Are you going somewhere? Will it be exciting?" Mallisen asks.

Egress smiles and considers silently just what this means. A child is a member of the Deliberative now. The only true concern in the mind of the Solar is for the safety of the Mallisen. She seems far from able to defend herself. Still, just having a child near brings a change, as if the Zenith is able to-at least for the moment-focus on something less daunting than the fate of Creation that has come to wear so heavily upon her.

Chi-Yosh is struck dumb. "Really?" He hopes the trip is not too violent for her soft heart. He steps to the girl and kneels. "Yes, we are going on an adventure. With boats and far away places and maybe buried treasure."

"I wanna come too!" Mallisen yells, and laughs like a silver bell. "Can I come?" She glances back at Marina, who gives her a stern and withering look, and the energy - but not the anticipation of adventure - leaves her. Once again prim and princess-like, she smiles at Chi-Yosh. "I wish you a safe voyage and a speedy return."

Ramar perks up at the mention of boats, buried treasure, and especially far away places. Something about the prospects ahead just seems to call to him. Especially given Mallisen's anticipation of adventure, which is more than enough for a score of Solar Exalts, to be certain. "We'll bring you something from the deepest ocean, and you can stay here and be our admiral. They get the best hats, you know," encourages Ramar. "The corner-y kind with a skull and crossbones and everything."

This proves sufficient to satisfy Mallisen, and Marina nods to the Priestess in some sort of silent message. The Sidereal leaves, and the negotiator rises. "She'll stay protected, Egress. I'll see to it personally. Now you lot had better get going. There's still a lot to do."

"You will have many adventures Mallisen," assures Chi-Yosh. "You cannot come on this one, but there are many ahead. You are in Heaven. Every day here is an adventure." A glance over the girl's shoulder to Marina, then his tone drops to a whisper. "Maybe Marina will lighten up and let you explore Yu-Shan while the spirits play and dance outside."

"Not likely," is Marina's stern, ice-cold reply.

"Thank you, Marina," says Egress softly. "As always, let me know what you need to achieve the tasks at hand and I shall do all I can." Egress pauses for a moment and asks Mallisen casually, "If you have something terrible caught in a corner, and it has one fang that might bite you more painfully than you can risk, what should you do, Lady Mallisen?"

The girl thinks a moment. "Ummm, like a cougar with a thorn in its paw or something?" she asks. "I saw one of those once."

"Just take the thorn out," she continues. "Once it isn't hurting any more, it'll be a lot nicer."

Egress smiles, nodding. "My Lady is very wise," she says. She rises then, bowing deeply. "I shall often rely on your advice, Wise Lady Mallisen."

Ramar considers, "Well that makes sense, I think. Thanks for the advice, Admiral." He adds, just as casually, "Yeah, we're gonna have to get you the right sort of hat, before we go sailing. You'll be there for the big send-off I hope."

"Of course!" Mallison reaches forward to give Ramar, or at least his legs, a big hug, then draws back and smiles widely. "And I'll tell you all about Pao when you get back too."

---

It is the last day of Calibration. Chi-Yosh's obligation to Azel, Mistress of the Antiquities of the Deep, has not been forgotten. Duly he presents himself to her, and the crusty old sea-goddess looks none the worse for wear. She is, in fact, smiling.

The smile shown as Chi-Yosh rises from his bow is welcoming. "Greetings Azel. It has been a year hence our agreement, and I have come to make myself known. I report to you also that your end of the offer has served me greatly, and I am thankful of it."

The smile fades from her mouth, but not from her eyes. "You're late!" she snaps, thrusting forward a tightly-wrapped silk bundle. Inside, by the feel of it, is a collection of paperwork and other odds and ends. "You'll find your first assignment in here," she says. "Finish that, and I'll let you know when I have something else for you."

Chi-Yosh is late? How could he have... it doesn't matter. "My apologies." Hefting the bundle, "I shall get on it as soon as I am able." He pauses, waiting to see if there is anything further from the goddess, before taking his leave. At a nearby cafe with a view looking down from the clowds over Creation below, the Solar unwinds the bundle and carefully sorts the contents and reviews.

Among other things, there is a handwritten note. 'The serpent-sting staff you possess was once in my power,' Azel has written. 'I allow you to keep it, but since it may help you fulfill my goals, I will do more than that. I will tell you its name, and that name is Three Sunrises.'

Chi-Yosh considers the note with a pleased little quirk of the lips. He was intending to look into the history of his weapon. Fate seems to be funny that way, delivering the item to him from she. Unless Rabbit just so happens to have connections that he had not considered. "Three Sunrises. Good."
