# Gods of Eden 2005-08-14

In the wake of Calibration, everything has shifted and a lot of chaos is staring the Heirophant in the face. The Realm lies on the brink of ruin, and across the sea, glaring at it hatefully, is an army rallying for its utter annihilation. In the threshold, disorder spreads on its own, waiting to be stamped out as the sources are still being sought. In this entropy, Egress decides it is her task to approach the warlord Ma-Ha-Suchi and see what might be done to satisfy his desires. The Realm in particular is a concern, but there are likely many things on the Lunar Hero's mind. Egress, as is her way, will go with Jin-nu and Rain of Fire, her Circle being already quite occupied preparing for the service of Azel, not to mention the countless other tasks that must be seen to.

As with most things these days, it is never one thing to do, but countless things. Egress seeks to learn all she can of the Lunars that lie in her path. Their ranks, deeds, and current worth are all of great interest to her. It is not the great she seeks, but those who stand lower than she does, and who do little while all about them Creation hangs in the balance. It is those who shall earn her ire, but not until she's fully prepared to deal with them. One can hardly bring down a mountain without the proper preparation, and having no weapon to defend her honor is finally starting to rankle.

Not only this must be managed, but the Guild, as well. With the growth of the Deliberative, Egress is less amused and more eager to put a very final end to the trade of life. She will watch from above for those who deal in flesh and send what news she can of them to the Lunars whose territory they come close to. A few dead slaves is to her a fine beginning. But only the power of greed can truly gain full control of the Guild and this she accepts with the same level of disgust that all members of the Silver Pact feel.

Even with these things, her mind drifts back to Yu-Shan, thinking of the spirits that starve, that have no homes, essence contracting so that there is little for them but scraps. It disgusts her that things have gone so far, so that even the Gods starve. She has to make an effort to stop the grinding of her teeth. All things in time. The Wyld is the enemy she must destroy to set that to rights, of course. Fortunately Azel shall throw her in the very maw of that chaos, giving her another chance to use her powers against the chaos that would dissolve all the world.

As with all others in Heaven, Ma-Ha-Suchi is restricted from departure - a fact he finds particularly chafing, as is evident from the pacing and fidgeting he exhibits. In the more open areas of the vast sprawl of Yu-Shan can he be found, working out his frustrations with moonsilver claws against vast slabs of carven stone that lie abandoned in an empty city block.

Egress can empathize with the annoyance over idleness. She fortunately has many things she can at least pretend to do while here. It is just that none of it can take shape until she can depart. She clenches a fist for a moment, then strides out towards Ma-Ha-Suchi. "All this waiting is starting to wear thin," she mutters. "But we can at least plan while below us whatever happens, happens."

The Lunar warrior rises, scenting the wind, and turns with an unpleasant look on his face. "You are at the center - or near the center - of everything that vexes me lately, woman," he growls. "What is it you want?"

"The Deathlords to die utterly and terribly, the liars and delusionals of the Realm to be left to be eaten by crows, the Guild to struck down to a man for its crimes, and for the Wyld and its pathetic spawn to be slashed so far back that the name is eventually forgotten utterly by mortals," says Egress. "But if there is one thing I've learned as an Exalt, it is that I almost never get what I want."

"All suitable goals," says Ma-Ha-Suchi, his comely voice returning to normal. "Now, when are we to be allowed out to pursue them?"

"If you feel particularly strong today, we could do so immediately, but I somehow think you share one more goal that is in my mind right now," says Egress. "I want to find that traitor and bite out his throat. I have a feeling, though, that we'll get him soon enough. We'll see how well he likes his new masters when the Powers order him to die eternally. Still, I'd rather just throw him into the Maw of Oblivion and be done with him, even if there might be something useful that we could twist out of him."

Ma-Ha-Suchi grunts. "There's something you aren't telling me about that business," he replies gruffly, eyes narrowing.

"That's the truth," says Egress. She looks about for a moment, "He knows something that holds all of heaven at bay. A power bad enough that even suspecting he holds it is enough to keep anyone from moving against him. You can imagine the rest, I believe."

The Lunar frowns, and scrapes out another chunk of stone using his claws. He effortlessly crushes the extracted rock in his hand, letting the dust trickle to the ground near his feet. "It's all foolishness. The Sidereals will act together until it fractures them into pieces. The gods fear change. We who would act are shackled. And all because... was it mercy or fear, I wonder."

"I don't know," says Egress. She finally lets out her frustration, "I HAD HIM!" she shouts. Her voice falls in a growl, "I _had_ him right there, and I could _not_ kill him! It was just, it was what would have set everything right. That will not happen again. By my name the next time I meet someone who should die, I will have the power to see it through. I am tired of this skulking!" She has no strength of Lunars, but she smashes her fist against the stone nonetheless.

Ma-Ha-Suchi laughs. "Ambitious, aren't you. How long have you been Exalted for?"

"I don't even recall. Less than two years, I suppose," says Egress. "But I feel that the luxury of growth has been stolen from me. The Sidereals waited too long. We should have been brought back a century past. We would be strong enough now to put a terror in the heart of the Deathlords. Instead, we are barely more than children compared to them. I have felt the wrath of the Dowager. I know how far away I am from being able to slay them."

"Then avoid them. That is what is wise," the Lunar suggests. "Strike when they show their throats."

"What is your next move?" asks Egress. "The Realm is apparently falling apart. A foe with its throat bared. The irony is, if I move to claim it for the rightful masters of Creation, the Deathlords will move. It's a curious situation, when what I've dreamed of since exaltation is in front of me, and yet matters move against us. Do you intend on knocking that rotting house down? And if you do, are you ready to deal with what will come of it?"

"You have spoiled my plans before, Egress," Ma-Ha-Suchi replies carefully. "If I am to tell you my plans this time, I must know yours."

"Very well," says Egress. "Though they are not my plans any longer. I am now not entirely my own. I believe the Realm must be stabilized. I plan to make it a Dragon Blood led puppet of the Deliberative. It's leaders will know who their masters are, but it must be kept quiet. I have reason to believe that the Deathlords have a very powerful hold on the Realm, however. I'm not sure if I can achieve my goal in that respect."

"A step in the right direction. Break the claws, then slash the underbelly later," says Ma-Ha-Suchi, nodding approvingly.

"Assuming that is achieved, we plan on making a capital in the east. I don't know the full details yet, since we are stuck here, but apparently the sorcerors have it in their minds to make it a flying city," says Egress. She snorts and waves a hand, "I don't know much of the flying part, but if it can move, that'd be useful. I want to use it as a fortress against our enemies. The Wyld irks me, but I am lacking tools there. Solar sorcery, even if it was in my hands at the moment, could not be used against the Wyld in the grand ways I desire. I imagine I hated stealthiness as much in the past as I do now. I trust that the sorcerors will figure out how to deal with such a thing when the time comes. The spread of Creation is important. I'm sick of seeing starving spirits in Yu-Shan. It's as much an outrage here as it is in Creation."

"Do you know why they hunger? Let me show you."

Ma-Ha-Suchi travels with Egress through some of the lonelier areas of Heaven, visiting the heart-breakingly beautiful architecture of the Celestial City and observing the spiritual barrenness that lurks behind it. Here and there, things skulk out of sight - just on the edge of Egress' awareness, and no closer, for they seem aware of detection.

"The actions of the gods can doom many men," the Changing Moon explains. "The gods of weather, the Council of Winds, and many other beings tied to the elements of air and water can cause drought over wide areas. Starvation, famine, and more have come up because of their fighting. The gods show their displeasure through such signs, but only when sorely provoked. But the same can happen to the gods. Look..." He holds out a taloned claw, indicating a distant tower. "A being made of smoke and fire once lived there, called Sinistrum. He was a god of the old Zathirian people, who lived on the inland sea. He was a spirit of fire, and hunting, and worshipped by all."

"Then the Zathirians were hunted to extinction by their rivals. The Five Tribes who slaughtered them took their idols, and dismantled their temples, and spent a decade ritually defacing them. Sinistrum was reduced to almost total powerlessness."

"Now he's almost a slave to Yurgen Kaneko, the Bull of the North, who uses the god to help power his steam-driven digging tools. He outlived the Five Tribes and their blasphemy, for those people were scattered to the winds when the Shogunate came east. Now... who has won here, do you think?"

"It is hard to say," says Egress. "But it seems wrong, in the end," she decides. "Honor shattered and reduced to this." Disgust twists her lips, her expression punctuated with a growl. "I imagine there are many stories like this. Many things that happened while my kind were lost to darkness."

"Let us say you overthrow the Realm and destroy its shrines of veneration - you have spoken of wiping out the Immaculate Philosophy before. What of the gods you displace by that act?"

"I had intended on finding them new purposes, new meaning and followers," says Egress. "Or are you suggesting it is the nature of even the Gods to eventually die?" she asks curiously. "I had always thought they were meant to be eternal."

Ma-Ha-Suchi shrugs. "Gods are eternal, or as eternal as anything. Even the Dragon-Blooded could slay them. And they can find new purpose - you should be glad Yurgen employed Sinistrum, because it's not easy." He turns and stares at Egress. "When I speak of destroying the Realm, I intend to make the isle run red with the blood of its citizens. I do not shirk from punishing them. Perhaps they will learn wisdom in their next life. But gods are different."

"It occurs to me that we would use idleness to steal the gods from the Realm," says Egress thoughtfully. "They'd fall pretty quickly without any support, I imagine." She laughs at herself, "I cannot speak of anything without thinking of a way to use it in battle, I've learned. My fate as a warleader fits well enough, I suppose. When you do slay them, though, you will be aided by those who know how to prevent your victory from being the Deathlord's victory as well. I will see to that, if you will it, anyway."

Ma-Ha-Suchi nods. "I do." He gestures out through the ghetto of Heaven. "You will find allies - small, of little power, but of great ambition - here. This is where I have done some of my best recruiting."

"How many are there here?" asks Egress softly. "I have many things to see to, for now all of Creation is my concern, and no one nation owns me." She isn't sure if she likes that or not, "I have risen and fallen, one might say. I will not fail."

"Counting the little gods, of places long-lost, of things long-forgotten, thousands. Perhaps more."

"What can they do?" asks Egress. "And how can I repay them? I do not know what they need that I can get for them. I believe I must push back the Wyld, so that more people may live in Creation."

"They can do anything their natures permit, Egress," Ma-Ha-Suchi replies, sounding slightly confused. "The gods are not men. They do not apply themselves to pursuits - they are made from something, and through magic they can change their natures. But it is not easy, nor is it quick, and it takes much Essence."

"Consider the god of the river. He may affect the waters of his river, or feel the boats afloat on it. But if that river dries up..."

"Then he must have the power to become something else," murmurs Egress, starting to understand. "For them, changing is a matter of effort, but it is different than that of the warrior who sets down his sword and takes up the plow. Is this how essence and will are tied? It is far more complex than I had imagined, the ways of Gods."

"For the gods, it is not a matter of setting down the sword and taking up a plow. The gods are the swords and the plows."

"Strange," murmurs Egress softly. "I never thought of it that way. They have their nature, and nothing else." She ponders for a time, "Have you ever grown tired of battle?" she asks suddenly. "When the Realm falls, and the guilty are destroyed, what then? What becomes of us, the spears, when the war ends, I wonder. It is perhaps a strange question."

"I grow tired of battle," agrees the Lunar. "When I do, I mate, or engage my mind in strategy or games. I hunt. I sleep. I let my nature find its own way."

"I am young, and I have grown tired once, but not I hear its call, and I long to fight again," says Egress. "My spear and armor lie as motes of dust, scattered on the winds. Without them I feel incomplete."

"Then abandon them. Find new weapons. Or make them."

"I want new weapons," says Egress. "But unlike the last time, I have no guidance to them. If I follow the prayers of my sister, this time I fear there shall be nothing but an empty ruin there. The Sidereals are being rather tight-fisted, as well. As for making them, the time involved and the drawing away of a skilled smith from other things is too much. I must seek a new way, I think, unless some help arrives unlooked for."

Ma-Ha-Suchi hums. "Then let us begin by finding the little gods of your old weapons. In this way you'll learn more about such spirits, and gain guidance in your other search, at the same time."

"I did not think they would survive the death of the weapons," says Egress. "But if they do go on, it would be a wise way to start the search. How does one find such a god? I can sense others here, but they seem to be avoiding us."

"Like this." Ma-Ha-Suchi takes a long breath, then bellows: "SHINJUKA! COME!" The entire plaza falls silent for long seconds. Then the distant beat of wings can be heard, and a strange flying creature makes itself visible from above. No longer hiding, it descends to the street and kneels before the Lunar leader. "Shinjuka. Spread the word. A god called Midmorning Sakura, once endowed in a Celestial weapon. Have it report to the Bureau, no matter what its condition." The spirit inclines its white-haired head, then takes to the sky in a furious beating of wings and flits off.

"One of my allies," Ma-Ha-Suchi explains. "A forgotten god of a winged race of men, who has no truck with the men of Mount Metagalapa."

Egress studies the small spirit with a grin, "It seems to get things done, at least. How did you come to make your first ally among them, though? Did you actually catch one of them here? Or did you use a spirit in Creation to call upon them?"

"Well, now.. " Ma-Ha-Suchi recounts the tale of his younger years as a Changing Moon - once, when he was less cunning but more interested in convincing than in destroying. Finding a long-lost temple high in the mountains of the Southeast, he had called to its god, only to find this being a broken creature without sustenance or hope. He became first its friend, and in truth later its master, although he still calls this being 'ally' in its honor. "Something broke inside Shinjuka," he explains at the conclusion. "It will not take supplication the way it used to. It still pines for its worshippers, and will have no others. But that is its way, and I respect it."

"It is like being wed to someone, then," says Egress. "Some will simply never take another, no matter how many years pass." She still puts things in the terms of a mortal. "It is interesting, though, how our lives alter the world and how the world influences and teaches us."

"That is what is natural."

"I have always learned a great deal from you," says Egress. "I feel I owe you a service to set things right. The dealings we shall do when the Realm falls is not a matter of debts. It is a like killing a leper, and it is the duty of the strong to see such things done in their proper time. Nothing I can do in that respect will reduce my debt."

Ma-Ha-Suchi raises an eyebrow. "And what sort of service do you feel would cleanse that debt?"

Egress cups her chin thoughtfully. "It is a debt of knowledge, but also of strength. I have learned a great deal fighting beside you against Harborhead, as well." And in the duel, though that was a rather different matter. "One, I should learn something of use to you. Something that you would not otherwise seek. The other should be a matter of wrath. Perhaps some matter that has laid below your notice or as little practical interest. Is there someone in the Realm you would see dead before the rest, perhaps?"

"As a matter of fact there is." Ma-Ha-Suchi's lips curl back insolently, revealing sharp fangs. "Let me explain..."

The Lunar again speaks, discussing his former plans. Harborhead, one of the Realm's allies in the South, was shattered. In result, the Varangians and other client states have been stiffened. His lightning attack warned the planners of the Blessed Realm to reinforce their forces, and the remaining client states have bound themselves ever more closely to the Realm as a result. Further attacks will be still more costly.

Now, he has learned of a deal between House Ragara and Houses Tepet and Cathak - a plan to better arm client states all around the Inner Sea, and to hire fresh mercenaries from all quarters. Interrupting the flow of jade and silver to the Blessed Isle would halt this plan, leaving the Realm open to attacks from the North. Ma-Ha-Suchi is fully aware of Yurgen's intentions to become a Northern power, and intends to ally with the Solar to use his newly-acquired territories as a staging ground.

"In short, disrupt the trade routes House Ragara uses - to the North and the East both."

"That I think I can do," says Egress softly. She grins widely, "We should thank those houses, however. I have this strange feeling they are going to help fund the building of a grand city. Would you care to share in some of those spoils? I imagine I can do a most terrible amount of damage to those fatties on their stolen island. They value jade more than blood, it seems. It's time to part them from some of it."

The Lunar waves a hand in a gesture of negation. "You keep what you claim," he says decisively. "I will have no part of their money, but I do not impose that upon you. If you have things that require it, use it as you wish."

"I simply find it fitting to turn the stolen spear upon its careless wielder," says Egress. "Many times I've thought of ways to use the greed of the Realm to destroy it. A pity it is doing so well at destroying itself when the world is not quite ready. It seems that everything will come at once, when it finally happens. The Deathlords must be swept away, then we can bash the Realm low, sieze the Imperial Manse, and put the wrath of Creation against the Fair Folk."

"Your jaws are not quite around that hare yet," Ma-Ha-Suchi murmurs. "Do this for me. Whatever debt you owe me will be repaid."

"I will see it done," says Egress. "Once I have that spear, I'll get my hands on this very directly. But at first, I'll just have to use my mind. I have so many fun little ideas for the friends of the Realm. In the end, I'll shatter their supplies and make them the Realm's most hated enemies. I will swear on that."

"I will hold you to that," murmurs Ma-Ha-Suchi, somewhat darkly.

Egress nods, "You will not be disappointed." She will be putting the twilights and night caste to work. "I just hope no one weeps when heads start to fall. I intend on turning those lands into Solar holdings later, but at first I can be more subtle. You should find it all quite the joke to watch."

---

Ma-Ha-Suchi's unorthodox ally returns with news. The spirits of Gallius' arms are not even in Heaven - its contacts suggest that the little gods are now least gods, perhaps bound to the site of the destruction, perhaps carried off by some local diety. To know their ultimate fate requires a departure from Heaven, which is still forbidden.

Egress frowns in thought. That is hardly promising news. "Well, with any luck I can find them without pounding some sense into anyone." Still, she is going to bring the Priestess along. She's not expert with spirits, and her usual kind of diplomacy is hardly going to work with a spirit. "That's that, then," she adds to herself. Waiting. That little Primordial-serving pest is going to pay for everything. The sooner, the better, as far as she's concerned.
