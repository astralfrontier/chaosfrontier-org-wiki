# Gods of Eden 2005-08-15

In Yu-Shan, beyond boundaries meant to keep festival attendees and guests of heaven out, are neighborhoods long abandoned over the years. War, famine, pestilence, death... all of these things have worn away at the edges of Creation. When people stop believing, the bureaucracy folds in on itself, casting aside what is deemed unnecessary. Here, gods no longer employed dwell. Beings long lost to mortal minds watch as someone moves past them. Two someones in fact.

Long-forgotten sections of the city stretch out in a labyrinth of twisted and once-fantastic architecture. Hints of belief and wonder bring about the subtlest changes as Ramar and his companion travel the almost empty streets. Even the dejected gods brighten as the Celestials pass by and turn down an almost forsaken alleyway.

Shandal, Changing Moon Exalt, walks with the confident, casual step of a warrior secure in his ability. The Realm-born Ikth-ya is marked by tanned, leathery skin and shoulder-length black hair. Elegant tattoos of flowing Moonsilver evoke thoughts of a winding stream amongst mountains, seen from an avian eye. A straight-edged Moonsilver blade of unremarkable length hangs from his back; when viewed by the weak of spirit, enchantments wrested from princes of the Raksha cause the weapon to appear mundane in nature. The Solars are beyond this, yet casual observance allows some of the magic to slip through; it flickers between mortal blade and godsbane on the periphery of vision.

Of all that could have come with Ramar, the Lunar was the best choice. While the Western-born Solar might have walked alone toward this fateful fight, Lunar pride was sore wounded by the unspoken Sidereal accusation of guilt. The Steersman was the icon of all that the Lunars hated about the Realm, and his death caused many eyes indeed to turn to the Moon-Children. But the Lunars cannot also claim first right here - it was the Solar Circle that unmasked Arnon and confronted him. Thus, Shandal - slightly less potent in Essence than Ramar, but still doughty enough to stand with him. Honor will be regained.

They have neared Arnon's hiding place. The air around them speaks of the corruption within. While stealth and shadows have their purposes, once Ramar descends from the alleyway... a change comes over him. Secrecy has almost served its purpose. Now there is a calm and determined set about his features as he walks towards the building. Something subtle.

---

The room is dark. The sound of two men - or things - can be heard breathing, although Ramar's other senses tell him that only one person is here. He and his Lunar fellow have been unopposed. Now he hears stirring, and a soul-shaking laugh from the voice of a young man who should not be able to utter such a sound. "The Path of Paradise leads me to the ruin of Yu-Shan. I think I shall start with you, sorcerer." It is Arnon speaking, the Dark Star, the outcaste Sidereal and bane of the Steersman. A candle lights of its own accord, revealing his youthful face and features twisted into a mockery of humanity. "What do you dare do to ME?"

Light swims around the twisted mockery that is Arnon. Opposite him stands Ramar, his features revealed by the candle as well. His stance shifts subtly, a tensing of the legs, a shift of weight towards his opponent. "Your Path can only lead to destruction and corruption. This cannot be allowed. I am acting as the will of heaven... your Path ends with me, tainted one." The candlelight flickers in the currents of Essence that are surely swimming around the Exalts.

"Surely you know what will happen if you attack me," sneers Arnon, and the other sound of breathing seems to stutter or stir, as though it were laughing.

"Yes. I will defeat you," replies Ramar. His face is as close to the Mask of Secrets as is humanly possible. "Or perhaps you had a different idea in mind?"

"I can see the future, fool!" the Sidereal crows. "I have foreseen the outcome of this fight in every detail! Bring about the destruction of your beloved city with your first act!"

"You see only what your tainted vision will allow you to see. You have lost the ability to witness Creation in its resplendent glory," answers Ramar. "Your vision is flawed. With every breath I take, the story changes. With every move, I undo your foul works."

Arnon sneers contemptuously. "Still a coward. Still nothing but words," he exults. "Have you come to bore me to death? If so, you may leave now. It is not my death I foresee."

Shandal does not bandy words, instead watching the renegade Sidereal with cold eyes. He senses that the time will come soon for the clash of steel, and there the truth of fate's will shall be determined.

Ramar nods serenely, "I pray that in death your masters will allow you peace. Let's end this." The time for words is at an end, though there is still one Word left to say. That can wait. Now, there is only the rush of heat and light Ramar's daiklave burns brightly in the room.

"You fool." Arnon's eyes narrow. "You dare to challenge me?" He draws Essence unto himself, and Ramar can sense a burning - and fatal - conviction growing in him.

"I must." Ramar prepares himself. Essence flows at his command, and the Name waits patiently. The time to be said is at hand.

The Quill of Heaven speaks. His voice is charged with Essence, and the word does not carry through the air. Instead it echoes in the very stuff of existence. The light, the candle, the shadows cast on the wall, the floors... everything seems to complete the word that leaves Ramar's throat. The same cannot be said for poor Arnon.

It takes a few moments for the Sidereal to realize what has been done. His eyes go wide at the enormity of the implications, for himself and for his mission, and the realization that two armed and very angry Exalts are confronting him takes hold.

Through the motion of one arm, Shandal Manyfeathers casts free his emerald robes. The Moonborn stands naked but for upper-body Moonsilver plating and a plundered loincloth of fine An-Teng silk, his powerfully built form plain for all to see. Skin begins to ripple and swell with the flow of muscle beneath as the Lunar grows to near nine feet in height. The truth of his title is revealed - tufts of feather push forth over Shandal's body, plumes extending from beneath the warrior's forearms. The great tail of a peacock extends and fans out behind him as great limbs thicken and lengthen with quicksilver power. The Silver Mirror offers a grin, more than somewhat twisted by his inhuman hybrid-form visage, as a clawed hand reaches to the weapon over his back and brings it smoothly to bear upon Arnon, the rogue agent of fate. For the first time, Shandal speaks, and his voice is the snarl of a wolf as it culls a sheep strayed too far from the flock. "Found fear at last, Sidereal?"

And the Lunar Exalt is in motion, his blade flickering between steel and silver in the candlelight. He launches himself at the renegade in a blur of predatory grace and speed, shifting weapon darting to attack. The warrior closes, and tumbles into a roll past Arnon. The Silver Sword flashes at leg-height twice as Shandal moves past, aiming to hamstring the momentarily stunned Sidereal, or at least test the strength of his defences.

A sudden swirl of Essence around Arnon are only salvation - the reflexive techniques of the Mantis Style martial art guide him through the familiar motions that a thousand perfectly-executed katas taught him, despite his shock at having Wayang's power imposed on him. Ramar recognizes the style from his time watching Chi-Yosh, and knows its defensive nature well. But added to this is something else, and both Exalts realize at once that Arnon has already invoked another Charm that guides his motions to superhuman perfection. With impossible, godlike grace he parries both strokes, barehanded.

Essence once again flows to Ramar, flitting about the orichalcum and steel of his daiklave at the edges of perception. Shadows move across the wall, shifting and distorting as the light from the flames is joined suddenly by the bright gold within white light that envelops Ramar. The Solar leaps, legs hooking under him as he stabs out. _I have fought this style before. The sword must be more than an extension of the body. They must be one and the same._ A rush of air across Arnon's perfect stance heralds Swift South Wind's rather sudden intrusion.

Again Arnon's Essence-driven defense guides his hands, and he slaps away the burning blade with his forearms. His sleeves smolder as he draws away, eyes ablaze with fear and madness. Nevertheless, his aura blazes with the distinctive colors of the Sidereal anima banner - a sight few in Creation can claim to have seen, indeed.

Again, the grace of Shandal's War-Form grants him the advantage. The Lunar closes to flank Arnon with Ramar, leaping effortlessly to confront the Sidereal. His Essence-charged blade smashes twice against the Sidereal's defences, and the Changing Moon then slides into a cautious, guarded stance.

In a stunning display of prowess, Arnon slaps away the first strike. For the second one, he is lucky - but only barely. He tosses his head back, losing his bangs in the process. Black hair floats away from his head, severed by the vehemence of the Lunar's thrust. His eyes grow wider yet, and he would have yelled out a choked cry but for the implacable power compelling him.

As the towering Shandal tears at Arnon, the Solar brings his blade around in a broad sweep. It ends tucked behind the Solar with a flourish. His left hand extends in front of him, guiding the flow of Essence as the Solar rushes toward Arnon. He leaps, twisting effortlessly in the air, and plants his feet on the ceiling. He flexes his legs and Swift South Wind descends swiftly, the force of each blow rebounding as Arnon parries serves to keep the Solar anchored to the ceiling.

Arnon twists, slapping away the blade on the first strike. As Ramar descends, he claps his hands together around the orichalcum blade. A wordless, silent cry of pain leaves his lips as his hands are scalded by the fire rippling from the ancient daiklave, but he has escaped the worst of his fate.

Silently snarling his contempt, the Dark Star rushes for a corridor leading to the back of the building. Therein is a window, and he vaults upward and outward, intent on jumping through it and escaping. Naturally, Ramar and Shandal give chase. Aware of it even as he leaps, Arnon tucks himself into a tight roll to smash through. Out the window he goes, eerily smashing glass that does not make a sound as it explodes outward. As he emerges and uncurls, one foot lashes back to kick at a shard of glass that still tumbles in the air. The transparent missile arcs in a deadly path toward Ramar's eye.

Their foe is breaking. Shandal combines the hard-won battle-instincts of a veteran Gunzosha warrior with the instinctive sense of Creation's deadliest predatory animals, the Lunar Exalted - yet needs neither to see this in a fleeing enemy. Vaulting out after Arnon, the Lunar straightens to streamline his mass and catch the Sidereal. Shards of glass bounce from his hardened skin as the hybrid falls, his blade leading. A prismatic display of blue and purple, reminiscent of light upon a stained glass window, springs into being about the Exalt. A guttural snarl escapes Shandal as his weapons lengthens and shifts, weaving about errant shards and chasing the traitor's rapidly descending form.

Arnon changes tactics as he whirls - a halo of green and silver light engulfs him, and Shandal recognizes the distinctive signs of a Combo. As his first attack darts evasively toward the Sidereal, he reaches out - not to parry, but to grab hold of the Lunar's arm.

Whatever else Shandal intended, it's now temporarily put to a halt, as the deft fingers of the tainted Exalt find crucial nerve-points and apply pressure. Even with the protean nature of the Lunars, the Sidereal mastery of _atemi_ is clear. He is held.

As Ramar watches his companion out in the street behind the heavenly house, one thing becomes clear to him. Arnon is no "junior Sidereal", as the Seeker said. Somebody has taught him the martial arts to a surprising degree, and the youthful-seeming Sidereal demonstrates a clear talent - perhaps mastery, perhaps not - of multiple supernatural styles.

Swift South Wind cuts a path through the building, shattering the stone and widening the window as the Solar flies after Arnon. The shard of glass the Dark Star has sent twists in its path. With a dreamlike motion, Ramar's arm twists and the Solar seems to simply flow to one side. The glass seems to almost pass right through his hand and then subsequently shatters with a musical tinkling against his breastplate. Light flows into unused parts of Yu-Shan, dispelling shadows that have been cast for ages... a new and terrible light, the light of Exalted fighting. Plaster and stone fall in Ramar's wake. A single stroke shatters bits of stone and sends a chalky gray mist flying towards Arnon.

Before what is left of the stone can touch the ground, Ramar pushes off, stepping lightly from pebble to pebble. His legs flex as he lands atop Shandal, standing gracefully atop the feathered Lunar. Feathers glow eerily in the wake of Ramar's sword as he brings it down past Shandal, towards Arnon and his wicked hold.

The Sidereal's one free hand swats at the sword, deflecting it away on both occasions - but at some visible cost to the Sidereal. His Combo blazes around him, and as Ramar watches, he begins the final phase of it.

Arnon leaps back, releasing Shandal and kicking off from the wall behind him. He lashes forward, his booted foot seeking out the Lunar's neck - or more precisely, a set of nerve-centers and bone found there. In this last instant, Ramar thinks he recognizes the other style. It is the Violet Bier of Sorrows, the rumored Sidereal martial art that leads to other, more fabulous myths of Sidereal proficiency. The renegade, thankfully, has demonstrated no such knowledge of these. Yet.

The beast does not like to be caged. Shandal snarls defiantly at the Sidereal Martial Artist who held him in thrall, viciously whipping his blade into the path of Arnon's kick.

In spite of his prowess, the Lunar feels a jerk of pain slide through his whole body as the vicious kick connects. He knows the other man has hit a vital spot, and despite everything, he has lost something of his edge to it. Not even his regenerative gifts seem to dull the spike of hot red that seems to have been shoved forcibly down his spine.

Shandal's natural grace falters, and he stumbles back a number of steps. The warrior drops to his knees, head bowed and teeth clenched against the pain. A fraction of a moment passes - all the time Shandal needs to shunt the pain aside as best he can. His head snaps up, and the Lunar's birdlike gaze glitters with the promise of vengeance. His form tenses, unwavering gaze watching Arnon carefully.

Ramar drops to the ground as Arnon and Shandal collide. His sword traces a firey warning as he shifts into a one-legged stance. Buoyed by wings of Essence and light, the Solar reaches upward with a hand, and then glares intently at Arnon. There's a gleaming above them, perhaps a star shining above Yu-Shan... one that grows brighter until it is a pillar of flame called down from the heavens... called down upon Arnon.

Arnon - the Dark Star - is struck by the falling conflagration. His martial arts abilities have toughened his skin against conventional attacks. Against this onslaught of Solar fire, though, something else is at work. Even a nearly-naked martial arts practitioner might be able to barricade his body against the flames of Heaven. However, Ramar knows from his understanding of the Charm that those creatures of the night - demons, the dead, and similar menaces - cannot stand against this attack. And it seems that something of that - enough, as it turns out - has become part of Arnon.

The Sidereal screams, fire consuming his body, turning his fingers and toes to ash, then his hands and feet, then his arms. In moments, he dies, screaming. It is the last sound he was permitted by Wayang.

"It is done." Ramar walks over to what remains of Arnon, and scatters with a sweep of the burning blade. The flames fade, though the air around them burns even as the daiklave is put to rest. Ramar sinks to his knees, looking wearily at Shandal, "Are you badly injured?"

Predatory light fades from Shandal's eyes. He straightens, and as he rises the bulk of a beastman form falls away, leaving only the straight-backed warrior. He bears no malice to Ramar for the final blow; unlike many of his cautious kin, Shandal has worked with - and come to respect - the new generation of Sun-blessed. And it is certainly true that the wolf hunts far better in a pack. Thusly, a grin is emblazoned upon Shandal's face, in spite of the agony, and he bows low to Ramar. "The hurt will leave, and I shall be stronger for having endured it. You, young Solar, fought with the tenacity of one with many more years of second birth. You have my respect."

"And you, mine," answers Ramar. He wipes the sweat from his brow, still surrounded by the flowing expanse of his anima. "You are very skilled... I suspect we'll all need to be in the coming days. But now... perhaps we'll have time." Ramar smiles, "It is done."

Off in the corner, watching the proceedings, the god Wayang smiles.
