# Gods of Eden 2005-08-16

With the mixture of things the Heirophant must contend with, it might surprise some that her mind is first turned to a personal affair, but it is. She must travel to a place she's been rather fond of avoiding. It is, after all, far from customary to visit one's own gravesite. She does not go alone, bringing with her Jin-nu and Rain of Fire, friends who have faced so many things with her.

On the field of the old battle, much has changed, scars washed away by the passing of time. Where men fell and died, grass grows thick and healthy, turning a darkened field into a vibrant green. Except for one area. In the midst of that field is a crater that glimmers black and lifeless, its surface still shining like polished glass. On its northern slope, as if in defiance of all, a graceful stem of some growing plantlife can be seen, shifting in the wind, but remaining firmly rooted in place. It is to that otherwise empty place that Egress must go, and with her friends she reaches the very edge of that crater. "It was here," says Rain of Fire softly.

There is the gentlest of winds blowing through this place. Egress and her companions watch it dance patiently through the grass. As she watches, she seems to catch sight of something - the figure doing the dancing. As though in a brief trance she reaches out. A sakura petal, all alone, blows lightly into her outstretched palm, and she rouses herself.

Egress starts in surprise. "I.. I saw her," she whispers. She then realizes that the petal is really in her hand, and she holds onto it gently. For a time, she just stands there, uncertain. "Stay here," she says to her companions then. With a soft sigh she leans down, removing her boots and slipping from them. "This is a holy place now." With her eyes closed, she reaches out with her senses, looking beyond the wind, beyond the glassy ground that she steps gracefully upon. Behind her, her tail twitches restlessly, feeling the flow of being in the air. Feeling for traces of that trickle of life she holds now in her outstretched hand.

At first, her walk seems plain enough, but soon her steps grow faster, as she crosses the crater. "I hear you now," she whispers softly, and the straining stops, her anxiousness to listen released so she can at last hear, and in the air, a song comes, soft, like the whispers of child in a throng.

Egress begins to sing, and the hearthstone she wears puts power into her words, flooding the air with life, and as she dances about the solitary bit of green in the crater, where she fell, her anima bursts into life, the ascending lion's wings spreading as the great form of silver rears and her performance becomes impossibly perfect, guided not by dull senses, but by the webs of essence itself. Her motions in the dance grow more clear to her friends that watch, for the Zenith is moving not like one unarmed, but as one would wielding the naginata, as if Midmorning Sakura were in her hands now.

The banner glows brighter and brither as the performance is steadily bolstered, and with it the Zenith directs essence to augment a weapon not even in her hands, her swinging motions charged with the power that sings through every fiber of her being, the joy of motion, of living here where she was almost lost forever overwhelming the fears for the future and mingling with the desires to find her friend and restore her, as well, to life.

With the formation of the Deliberative, and the careful hinting of a supply of ancient lore, Egress has become aware that there are tomes available in Heaven which were locked during the Usurpation, and which will only open with the correct pass-words. Some of these are kept in the Book of Three Circles, and the nascent Celestial alliance is learning about secrets that have been kept from it for millennia.

Several of the Sidereals have been working on the "Deathlord Problem", and it is they who first call Egress back to Heaven. They have a possible solution, it seems, based on a technique a previous Heirophant used.

Crying Blade, Chosen of Battles, accompanied the Solar Circle on their raid into the Underworld. He knows something of the Abyssals and their dark masters, and has actually fought such beings before. It is he who speaks, while around him a semicircle of the other Chosen gather. "It's more of a battle technique than a true weapon, although it functions like one," the man explains. "The ancients called it 'Blade of the Celestial Mandate'."

"It's based on the same sutra techniques that we use for our martial arts, and it's compatible with those same martial arts. It requires a commitment of Essence to work - both from you and from others, which I'll explain." The man gestures to a large worktable. On it are strip after strip of prayer-paper, inscribed with symbols in the Old Realm. They are dedications written to Egress in her capacity as Heirophant, apparently authored by the Sidereals and a smattering of Lunars and Solars.

Each one speaks of promises and loyalty, of mutual dedication to a larger cause and of support for the Solar in her own pursuit of it. "Each one of these, you'll find, has a mote dedicated to it," Crying Blade explains. "Touch one, and commit five motes."

Egress looks over the prays, more than a little curious. She selects from them a prayer of a Lunar, setting her hand upon it and directing her essence outwards, the flow drifting easily from her. She cannot help but wonder what is going to come to pass, but for now, she will simply let what will happen, happen.

The paper begins to ripple - but so do all the others, as though a faint wind were tugging at them. "It's incomplete right now. But we'll join the pattern with that of your former weapon to complete it. Wait for us, will you?"

"Very well," says Egress, still far from certain just what to make of this. She has little to do but wait, which is, as usual, something she is horrible at. At least she has things to plan. Ma-Ha-Suchi has given her quite the task. It does not help that she made it even harder. Still, it seems a task worthy of the Heirophant. It will gain support for the Deliberative, after all.

The Sidereals work. They utter arcane prayers to the pattern spiders, sending along carefully-drafted petitions. They channel Essence in unheard-of ways, centering around the shattered remnants of Midmorning Sakura's least god. They carefully adjust the prayer strips into an elaborate mandala on the floor with the god at the center, finally completing four hours of rites. All are exhausted, and as servants bring food and refreshments, Crying Blade smiles wanly.

"We're finished," he says. "Stretch out your hand, and call your companion to it.."

Egress is not sure just what shall happen, but she is eager to see her friend again. Her hand is extended and with a surge in her caste mark she calls out, "Midmorning Sakura, come to me now! The sun is rising, but the day is still in doubt!"

The papers on the ground stir again, caressed by the breeze. But now they actually rise. And float, drifting on a sudden draft of wind that comes from everywhere. Slowly they circle Egress, uncertainly flitting and wobbling. Then the pattern strengthens. They begin to converge - to coalesce rather - and wrap themselves around an invisible shaft. A spear starts to take shape, assembled out of simple prayer strips. Nothing but paper, and yet it feels as solid as diamond in Egress' hand. The naginata is shaped.

Crying Blade withdraws a fair-sized block of alloyed steel from a pocket in his robe and lobs it at Egress. "Cut it!" he bellows commandingly.

Egress moves in a blur, her eyes narrowed as reality vanishes utterly, save for the spear that is part of her and the target, mere steel. Essence surges through her hands into her weapon, charging the spear and wielder with a power that neither could ever hope to achieve alone, the pure energy of the blow torturing the air like the merciless surge of lightning.

The deed is done. Two perfectly-carved lumps of steel strike the floor of the workshop at the same time, the cut that divided them impossible to discern.

Noting the Zenith's expression, Crying Blade explains. "The power of the Blade of the Celestial Mandate technique is just what it sounds like. The support of your peers, made manifest through prayer-strips. Their support becomes your fighting power, directly. As long as their faith in you does not waver, this weapon cannot be broken."

"It takes whatever form you give it. For now, that form is modeled on your old weapon. As you learn more about the technique, you can develop the weapon too. New sutras can be written that give it new powers. Its potential is limitless."

Egress raises the weapon and examines it curiously, "That is amazing," she says softly. "Midmorning Sakura passed with Gallius. Now she too returns." The Zenith lets out a soft breath, listening closely and nodding. "It is only fitting," she decides. "You are now the Faith of the Celestials," Egress says to the weapon. "And you shall never be broken." She looks to those who labored so intensely upon this weapon and smiles, "You have my eternal gratitude, my friends. I accept what you have offered. I shall do all I can to live up to your lofty expectations."

The Sidereals nod slowly, smiling amongst themselves. Crying Blade speaks again. "You should be able to collapse it back into a sheaf of prayer-strips," he notes. "When you need it again, call it up like you did before. And finally, you'll feel it if someone's support is added or withdrawn, while you're wielding the weapon."

Egress considers that for a moment, raising on one foot and stepping suddenly back. The weapon whirls in her hands faster and faster, and then, when it can be spun no faster, the prayer strips are suddenly released, each nestling between her fingers, standing straight as razors. "This is going to be a most exceptional weapon," Egress says, a smile curving her lips.

"I'm glad to hear that. We've got more when you find the least god of your armor too," Crying Blade continues conversationally. Egress turns, raising an eyebrow...
