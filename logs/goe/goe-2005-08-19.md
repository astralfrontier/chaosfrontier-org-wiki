# Gods of Eden 2005-08-19

Unexpectedly, the Solars are notified that the Celestial Lions have lifted the restrictions on departure. The gates of Heaven are once again open, and eager Celestials flood forth in twos and threes, and often fives. Creation is waiting, and they are eager as ever to impose their own vision upon its chaos.

No word about the reason is given - nothing other than news that the Dark Star has been dealt with. And, curiously, there is no sign of Ramar.

---

The coming months or years will see much darkness, pain and and war. It is inevitable in the Nation's, in Creation's future. Taking this fact in stride, Chi-Yosh ventures to Greyfalls, to see the tree-spirit Halvah, of health and renewal. "There is a great valley in the southlands of our Nation. It is a sacred place, of peace where the local people have sworn never to befoul with violence as a final request of a beloved leader who is buried there. Here I would like to make a place of medicine, of learning and of healing for the wounded. This place I offer to you as a glorious temple, where all who work and train within shall sing your praises, if you bless this vale with your presence."

Chi-Yosh ventures to the vale, standing upon a high bluff to look down upon it. Grass a vibrant green, shining under Helios' smiling radiance. Not a blemish of stone upon the vale, or a stain of dropped blood staining the earth's history. Hamlets and villages can be spotted across the rolling hills, peaceful. As the wind picks up, the Su'Katan releases the seeds, allowing them to spread across the valley, and where-ever they may fall, trees shall spout.

From Bridal Veil, the Nation of the Sun releases a decree: within the next six months, all healers are requested to the great Temple of Halvah, within the South among the villages of Talheen and Brimmen. Those who come must stay only a month, to learn and to train new apprentice doctors and assistants. Those freshly trained from the last month shall go to the villages the healers come from, so none shall be without soothing hands. The Nation calls for apprentice apothecaries and medicine women, offering to pay families a stippened for allowing their sons and daughters to travel far to become a caretaker of the ill.

Meanwhile the Su'Katan travels to the East of the Nation to its forests. There he makes a deal with the local spirits: give up small pieces of land, and compensation will be given; better positions in larger forests, promotions or even small jobs in Heaven. Once they are appeased, the lands are cleared. Chi-Yosh then travels to the west, to speak to Bringer of the Bounty of the Land in the croplands. "Come, spread your power in the East, help us make a great bread basket for our people, and they will pray to you over every meal that comes from your hands, if the treasures you offer make our people strong and hearty."

Some of the smaller sprites and wood elementals, the tiny goods of the forests are offered a new position: Royal Gardener of the Nation's Apothecary. Groves are selected for herbs and plants collected by Chi-Yosh from the Elemental Pole of Wood. Rare specimens with great magical potency and the capacity for healing. Here the spirits are to tend day and night, to make the crops grow fast, to harvest and continue the cycle as hard as they may. In return, the gardeners and workers in the lands give gifts and prayer, as do the workers who collect and store the herbs, their medicines, and the healers who use it.

Chi-Yosh returns from his errand to find Ramar, already with the others. The Solar's disappearance coincided with the unlocking of Yu-Shan's gates; just what happened?

Though it has been a few days since the unlocking of the gates, Ramar has been scarce up to this point. "I see you're all doing well," begins the Solar. "I'm glad... I was worried about retribution from other sources. It took some doing, but with the help of a rather powerful Lunar named Chandal, I was able to defeat Arnon."

Davron breathes a sigh of relief. "That was a terrible danger he posed - I admit I'll sleep a lot easier knowing that he's been dealt with."

Chi-Yosh's brows raise. Ramar had went without notifying them? Well, it's not as important now - he may not have been able to, and in either case, he is alive and well. "Please, do not hold back the details."

Egress considers Ramar in silence for a time, tilting her head. "Well, he does look the same.." she murmurs to herself. "Are you alright, Ramar?" she asks, her voice more than a little uncertain. "Nothing happened, did it?"

"I'm tired... but yes, I am alright. Relieved more than anything else. Quite a bit happened, even though I was able to neutralize his power... he still put up quite the fight." Ramar sighs, for the first time in days, and looks truly relieved. "I still find it hard to believe... but I beat him. I didn't know I could." He takes another deep breath, allowing everything to sink in, and begins to detail his fight with Arnon. Everything from Wayang's name to the dangerous techniques employed by his adversary. "It made me realize I am a lot more capable than I, or even anyone else, have given myself credit for... and also that I have a lot to learn still."

Ramar adds, apologetically, "I'm sorry that I did not let you know sooner... but this was something I had to do for myself. I don't know if you'll understand or not... but, there it is."

Now that he's had a chance to think about what he's heard, Davron is uncertain. "I'm not sure that I do. Even without the ability to call upon his new patron, an Exalt is a dangerous foe. It'd have been safer if you'd had more help." He grins again. "Then again... maybe I do understand. We can't always do things the safest way, lest the opportunity slip from us."

Chi-Yosh smiles, understanding but prideful. "I am glad you have found that you are more than what you thought you were, Ramar. You never know what you can do until it is done, and in that I am happy for you."

"We do what we are meant to do because we are who we are," says Egress simply. "Show faith in moments of danger and you will survive. If you show doubt, and you shall leave the weave of destiny forever. It is good that you were victorious. It means we can all get back to our work in Creation."

"You're right. And now I know I will be able to help Creation, to serve it as I was meant to." Ramar smiles, and looks at his friends. "I'm just glad to see you again. I'm ready to get back to work. What needs doing next?"

"The Deliberative needs a home," Davron says. "Even if we can evade the Deathlords' attention, we will be making many powerful enemies in the months and years to come..."

Davron looks troubled, recalling the Dowager's attack on the Nation. "And... I no longer want to put the lives of the Nation in danger on our account. We need a citadel - a place that will put no innocent people at risk. But... where could we go? What land could harbor us..." he continues, half to himself. Then he blinks, and begins to laugh. "Not land at all... but the sky!"

"The sky? You mean to build a citadel in the sky?" Ramar sounds... well it's not quite disbelief... more interested and excited by such a prospect. "Please, Davron, tell us more..."

Davron chuckles. "Why not? It's been done before - by Bagrash Kol, for starters. Of course, he had the Eye... but _we_ have the Book." His excitement dims, then. "Except... do we have time? I don't even know where to begin yet, but I do know it's going to take a lot of building. More than I can do alone, even with my automata." He turns to Egress, urgently. "Egress, are there any other Twilight Solars still left in Yu-Shan? This is a job for the whole Deliberative..."

"You don't have to do it alone, you've got us. And as you say... there is the question of time... perhaps through the book we can find a way to make enough time..." Ramar continues, "But more than that, I, and hopefully at least one other Solar can command the Wyld and use that to shape what materials we need, if time does become an issue."

"I can get you the help you need," says Egress softly. She raises a hand, and from her sleeve drift what appears to be strips of paper. With a sudden blur of motion they roll themselves into the form of a naginata. "But I shall have to prove myself once more a leader. Fortunately, I have a fitting task to earn the respect of our peers once more."

Davron blinks at Egress' weapon. "Where did you get that?" he asks, always intrigued about the nature of an Essence shaping. "It doesn't have the feel of a work of artifice..."

"It's a work of faith," answers Egress. "It is the work of Sidereals, binding the least god of Midmorning Sakura to the prayers of those who believe in the Heirophant of the Deliberative. Right now, there are just a few, but as we prove ourselves worthy..." She clutches the weapon tightly, "Fortunately, Ma-Ha-Suchi has provided a way to do just that."

Chi-Yosh glances at the origami weapon, then at Egress. Is she planning to rebirth Morning Sakura? Egress spoke of becoming a firmer leader; is Gallius shining through?

"Speaking of Ma-Ha-Suchi... with our accomplishments in Yu-Shan lately," says Ramar, "We should be able to tell him that we've finally got a way out of this mess."

"I'm sure he is very grateful, and in the way of the Silver Pact, I'd imagine he shows his gratitude by getting immediately back to Creation and making use of what you have done for us all." Egress sighs softly and says, "I told him I would put an end to the allies of the Realm that still linger in the east. He suggested I shatter the flow of Realm money. That is a trick for an uf-ya, perhaps, but I am better than that, and I do not act alone. We will take those nations and shatter their leadership, putting up our own kind as rulers."

"A weapon whose power grows with that of the Deliberative," says Davron, nodding, his gaze turning inward again. "First, we need to travel to Bagrash Kol's fortress once more," he says. "It has flown once - it can fly again. And it will be faster than starting from scratch - though once we've proved the principle..." He trails off, his head already full of occult patterns and the principles of flight.

"If we must, then we must. The thing to consider then, is how this will affect things as they are going to be shaping up on the Blessed Isle... this will eventually be felt there," Ramar points out. He sighs, "But, we'll have time if we must do this. Let's just make sure of the consequences."

Chi-Yosh says, "When would such a campaign begin? Because we just returned from war and the tension of Heaven - would it wait until we can get the Deliberative on its feet and in its new home before we try to break the Realm, or break its coffers first and let it writhe now?"

"We will not be breaking the Realm," says Egress. "We will be chaining it and getting it ready to be reshaped." With a flow of essence, the spear draws back up her sleeve. Perhaps symbolically, at that. "For now, the Realm must be saved, and the terrestrials must rule it."

"Then we must try and see to it that this... ending of allies of the Realm in the East, serves the purpose of getting the Terrestrials to save the Realm. Such as it is. Or at least to keep it from falling further?" Ramar looks puzzled, and just a little concerned.

"It is going to work," says Egress. "The Realm is wasting its resources on all manner of idiotic expansions. We will force it in on itself, select the proper ruler, and with the aid of the Celestials, put that ruler in place."

"But we cannot do that until the Deliberative is strong," repeats Chi-Yosh. "We need our power and authority to place a new Empress, even one who swears to us, on the throne. More Solar voices need to be with us."

"Perhaps," says Egress. "Or we would, if we did not have the aid and interest of the Sidereals. Even those who are not supporting the Deliberative will be able to see the great aid Solars can give to anyone they wish to rule the Realm. The Sidereals will find those who are capable and we will use our influence and our wisdom to make certain the final choice is one we can accept." She shakes her head, "But this is still far from the current task I would do. The breaking of these Realm allies is important. They are a threat and so long as they remain, the Realm will have an easy toe hold in the east."

"Hello, my friends." It's the voice of Kez Sark, the Ronin. Still insouciant, still with his sword at his side and spectacles on his nose. None detected his approach; rather, it seems more that he willed himself into the presence of the Circle, and instead of arriving chose to be there all along.

The Sidereal gives a casual wave, smiling all around. "Have I been part of an interesting conversation?"

"If you can't recall, it wasn't that riveting," quips the Dawn.

Davron looks up, not as impressed as the Ronin might have had a right to expect - he was so distracted, he wouldn't have noticed any sooner had the Sidereal announced his entry with trumpets. "Uh... I'm afraid I wasn't listening. You'd have to ask the others," he says with a sheepish grin.

"I **did** hear enough to pique my interest." Kez lifts himself from where he leans and walks forward, pacing among the Solars. "You're worried about engaging the Realm's client states, aren't you. Shall I tell you a secret? A ship in the storm has only its anchors. And those anchors have nothing but chain - or in the Realm's case, old rope. Cut the rope and you can sink the ship. Or, at least, steer it closer to your waters."

Egress listens to the Ronin, but has already thought much along these lines already. It's hard not to think in these terms as of late. She does not bother wondering at how fast things change in Creation. "I hope we can steer the ship from the disaster of a long war, at least."

"Wait... we're going to have to do this, and that's fine," says Ramar, "But uhm... isn't there an obligation you have, Chi-Yosh, to do for a year? All this talk of ships and anchors reminded me of it..."

"Yes." The Su'Katan sits up straighter. "Azel has a mission for me. I must depart soon, in fact. House Ragara has begun to explore a sunken city in the Southwest. They are beginning to plunder the upper halls. Azel wants the entire operation stopped."

"House Ragara, hmm?" Egress taps her lip and nods to herself thoughtfully. "The work that Azel has for you-and for us-is worthy. We will not let you go alone, Chi-Yosh. It is likely to be extremely useful in achieving our goal of cutting the strings the Realm has cast over the oceans, as well."

Kez Sark, grinning like a fool, simply makes a slicing or cutting motion with two fingers, as though a sword were going through anchor-rope. "Just so."

Chi-Yosh nods. "We will set sail then in four days hence. I have an idea of how I would like to execute this situation, but I would like to have a better idea. Perhaps we should send our unseen friend to scout ahead?"

"If you feel that is wise, Chi-Yosh," says Egress. "I must do a great deal to arrange things. The Deliberative must be informed at all times. I want to be sure that the Sidereals know where we are and what we are doing. They have sworn to us, and it is their right to know. I doubt they will think poorly of our involvement in this, but if they do, I doubt it will be the last time I have to change their minds."
