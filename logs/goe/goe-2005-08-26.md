After preparing themselves for the rigorous battle to come, the Circle makes the final arrangements. While Egress and Davron make final arrangements, Chi-Yosh and Ramar take to Yu-Shan. Getting the right paperwork to haul a volo through the streets, the pair take the route that the Su'Katan had traversed once before with Spider. From a gate in the Far West, the two take wing for half a day, before settling down on an oncropping of rock thrust forth from the sea. There the Solars call to the Nain-ya Seawind, who had helped the Solar in his trip to the fabled water city. She comes ashore. While leary of the Volo, the three take flight back in the direction of the gate, and travel back through Yu-Shan to the Nation. Finally the five set sail for the Southwest.

Taking to the air in their great ship, the Solars spend several days. The sands and scorching sun of the Southlands greet them for a time, until the far coast and the long, azure sea is in sight. Down drops the boat, and at Ramar's behest, the crew of five bustle around, setting sail for the outcropping islands. Their destination is not the islands inhabited with barbarians worshipping rogue spirits and more dangerous creatures, but somewhere amid the chain, where once an island breeched the waves, and towers stood tall into the bright cerulean sky, seen for days to come. Finally, Ramar with his sharp eyes, spots the reflection of the bright sun off of something in the distance: a refraction from spired rooftops cresting the waves, alabaster walls gleaming beneath their metallic domes and tiers. And amid the small garden of towertops are ships flying Ragara colors.

Havesh haunts the docks and port cities, listening for rumors. He requires only a day to acquire paperwork, witnessed evidence, and other information, and this he returns to the others to rely. It seems that there are a total of twenty-four recognizable Dragon-Blooded, and probably a dozen more, involved in the project. Virtually all are Water-Aspected. Serving them are a staff of two hundred sailors, dock-wallopers, and other trustworthy mortal men.

Distant observation reveals that the Dragon-Blooded work in shifts. Some will dive, while others stay on the surface. Their sailors and other subordinates work the rigging, or keep lookout. They run an exceptionally tight ship. And more obscure methods of observation reveal that several elementals of water and air circle the area.

Spells of warding stand in place as well, defeating magical scrying and teleportation attempts of all types. Most of the useful information about the operation comes from a simple spyglass.

With the ship still away from the detection of the looting Dragon Bloods, Egress directs Ramar to draw near the waters. There the Zenith will shed her armor and dive into the waters of the sea, her anima banner bursting to life as she seeks to gain the attention of the elementals of the sea, showing them the sign of the Zenith, which she imagines hasn't been seen here for many centuries. Which she hopes has not yet been forgotten utterly.

Aside from the more mundane life below the waves, and an eerie radiance that seems to emerge from depths unguessed-of below, Egress is aware of some of the larger and smarter creatures of the western waters. Among them are the playful, capricious, and sometimes deadly elementals that swim hither and yon. These fabulous aquatic creatures sometimes swim closer in curiosity, and other times swim madly away.

Egress shines like a beacon on the waters, the winged lion above her looking strangely calm, surveying rather than roaring as the solar keeps herself afloat. Her voice calls out above the noise of the waters, "I am Egress, Zenith Caste and Heirophant of the Deliberative! I call you to come near and heed me, for my circle has been called here in the service of Azel!"

On the distant boats, signs of alarm being raised begin to reveal themselves - slowly, but surely. Some of the creatures that came are surely reporting back to their binders. Others dwell in the waters around, bobbing or bubbling or murmuring in fishy, bubble-filled voices.

Egress watches those that depart closely. They shall be free later. Somehow, her carriage changes, so that even in swimming she looks regal, as if the water itself is doing all the work in keeping her afloat and she is swimming only because it suits her. "I ask only that you stand aside until the time is right. I shall call upon you again. Not to do battle against the Dragon Blooded, but to save the innocent from being swallowed by the waves and in restraining your kindred from aiding those that would enslave you and steal from the treasures that you hold. Those who aid the Deliberative shall be remembered, for though my gaze now spans from uttermost north to the deepest south, my prayers of gratitude shall be turned to you and you shall be better for it. Will you aid us?"

_We serve out of greed. Others are bound. It is the power of magic, and we do not restrain them. What do you offer us, for the memory of man is worth little._

"I am no man," answers Egress simply. "I am the Heirophant of the Deliberative. What is it they offer you that leads you to violate the will of Azel?"

_The favor of Truk Trin, god of Exploration of the Depths, Lighter of Dark Ways and Seeker of Truths Hidden in Shadow. He is known to us. Your Deliberative is not._

Truk Trin's name is known. He is a spirit of power in Yu-Shan, affiliated both with the Unconquered Sun's name and with the courts of Water found in the West and Southwest.

Azel's wishes are known. She asserts control over all that is lost under the waves - even knowledge of it. To convince her otherwise, particularly after the gift she has given Chi-Yosh, would be a great burden. But there is another way - elementals, and others, might be permitted into the lost places of the sea with her favor, if they acknowledged her as lord.

"And would Truk Trin be just as pleased were you to explore the ruins yourself?" asks Egress calmly. "If you acknowledge the lordship of Azel, I believe you will be allowed to do so, and thus gain the good will of both of them. It would be a pity that we should have to come to blows this day, but that choice is yours to make, but I promise you, those on the ships away there," and here she gestures towards the Dragon Blooded vessels, "Will either turn away, or make their tombs here."

_If you speak of conflict, we withdraw. The Anathema are puissant but not trustworthy, but we believe them when they say they swim to battle. We once knew you under another name. We will watch, and see what name to call you once your quarrel with those short-lived is done._

"What will be, will be," says Egress. "You will see that the centuries have not weakened our resolve. Farewell for now!" And here she raises her arm, the prayers that form her spear suddenly drawing together and stabbing skyward as she waits for Chi-Yosh to draw her aboard once more.

Through the spyglass, Ramar becomes aware of Essence cannon being slowly charged up on the decks of the distant Realm vessels.

Reaching over the side, Chi-Yosh drops Egress a line and hauls her from the water. At the call from Ramar of the coming threat, the Dawn glances down at Egress with a wry smile. "It seems we are about to be welcomed."

"Right then, we have a bit of trouble ahead of us," remarks Ramar. "It seems to me that we can have Davron set their sails aflame and once the ships are isolated work on taking them one at a time? Like as not we can dispatch the Dragonbloods before too many reinforcments show up, and if they see us fighting, the mortal defenders might consider that they have better things to do than fight us. Like surrender, perhaps."

"Their sails are probably warded against fire," Davron remarks, "but I'll do my best. Or give me half a chance at spotting the helm and I can take out their helmsman."

Ramar considers, "Then sunder their masts," he suggests. "If you can manage that sort of thing, that is..."

"Or their gunners, if neither are available," adds Chi-Yosh.

"I think Chi-Yosh and I can likely handle one ship each," suggests Egress. "Mortals will not be able to stand against us, and they will likely turn tail and run when they see the wrath of a Zenith." And as she speaks, she bursts into an even more intense glow, her form becoming even more lordly, amplified by the power of essence into something that would make all but the bravest of mortals cower in terror.

"Then Davron and I shall take the final one," adds Ramar. Swift South Wind flashes in his hands, "Now, let's see if I remember how you do this... as I recall, you need a rope to swing in on..." He grins, and adds, "Careful though, they might try and knock you over, or get their elementals to make the water rough."

"So be it," says Chi-Yosh. For a moment, Essence shimmers across his form like Helios gazing into an oilslick, before the power glides down his limbs and shimmers over the muscles. Each of his movements turn smooth and graceful, ready to react.

"That seems reasonable enough," says Egress. Along her limbs and down the edge of her spear, essence flows like little bolts of lightning, the already fearful weapon gaining still more power from the essence of its bearer. "I don't think this is a voyage any of them shall soon forget."

Ramar's body is suffused with Essence as well. He tenses, slightly. "Right then. Now I believe we have some ships to be getting too... will you be getting there yourselves, or would you have me give you a lift, such as it is..."

Davron takes up a position at the edge of the vessel, drawing an arrow from its quiver. The shimmer of Essence over his form, though it has the same nature as Chi-Yosh's, is somehow stranger for the archer's rapt stillness as he seeks out a target.

There is something decidedly curious about the Solar's approach. It may be that they seem to be sailing directly against the winds, or that the currents seem to hold no bearing on their speed. Nevermind the lack of sails on the ship. The most curious thing of all is that the Solars are sailing several feet above the water. A sharp spray of water is sent out beneath it as its powerful engine guides it through the air. Ramar is at home surrounded by the vast blue deep, while at the helm of a ship. An airship, but a ship no less. The winds and waters speak to him, tell him their every move, and it is a matter of minutes before the Dragon Blood's ships are just ahead. The ship is bathed in the glow of the Circle's collective magics, heralding the defeat of those who would oppose them. "Right, let's do this," says Ramar, and as he's something of a traditionalist adds, "mateys."
