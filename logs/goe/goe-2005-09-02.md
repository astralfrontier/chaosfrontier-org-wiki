# Gods of Eden 2005-09-02

Davron and his Twilight cohorts have worked like rock-gnomes at the issue of the flying citadel. Now, the man and his companions are finally exhausted. They are tended for the most part, and left to recuperate. Even Solar stamina can be tested by a session of inspiration, genius, lore and a hint of madness that would kill a mortal architect.

Egress, on the other hand, sleeps less soundly. In her dreams she finds herself on the shores of a vast ocean. The rocky cliffs on which the surf breaks are of a grey, ancient stone, and the air is cold as it blows across her skin. Next to her is Davron. His skin is metal and his eyes are crystal orbs. When he moves or speaks, there is a soft creaking or grinding sound. His breath is warmer than normal, and flickers of orange dance in his throat when he opens his mouth, hinting at an actual furnace inside his belly.

And in this dream is the Storyteller, wearing a simple robe. On his wrist is a black, flexible strap with an intricate timepiece attached - like the Master's brass pocketwatch, but smaller and more detailed. The ur-Sidereal gestures, smiling, and something on the nearby beach catches Egress' attention. It is a small coracle, or 'sea-bucket', but it has no sail.

"Come sail away," he says, and begins walking toward it.

The Davron-automaton steps forward a few steps, then gestures to Egress. "Come along," he says, the sound of gears in his voice.

The two Solars follow their fellow to the beach, and step into the small sailing craft. It drifts away from the sand, carried on the cold tide, and the Storyteller folds his legs beneath him as he sits down and leans back against the side. "Catch the wind," he commands Egress, and gestures at her hand. Holding it up for inspection, the Solar discovers that the Old Realm word for 'wind' has been tattooed onto her palm. The Storyteller mimes an action, holding his hand up into the air as though it were to be the sail of the little ship.

Egress frowns thoughtfully. This makes no sense at all to her. She does not hide the fact that she is not in love with the sea. Such a large area where she can't set her feet safely is naturally not for her. Still, she will do what is suggested. Or try to. She lifts her hand above, splaying her fingers in the gusting air.

The gesture is enough. Wind blows with great force into her palm, and the coracle jerks at the sudden motion. The little vessel is off, cutting through the water at near-miraculous speed. The Storyteller smiles calmly, getting comfortable. "We will sail beyond the moon," he promises. "We have time to speak one truth apiece before we arrive."

"I do not understand what you mean," says Egress. "What do you mean by one truth?" she asks. She finds it odd that she doesn't have trouble keeping her feet, usually having at least a little trouble keeping her feet on any vessel.

The Storyteller nods. "We are sailing to the Moonlit Garden of the Gods. There are many spirits that do not obey the Celestial Hierarchy. They roam the worlds beyond the Wyld and do as they will, sometimes returning to Creation for their own purposes. We go to visit them." He falls silent; the sky overhead begins to turn from blue to purple.

"Why do we do that?" asks Egress. "Are they willing to help us set things right in the world?" She looks over to the thing that seems to be Davron, shivering a bit. It makes her skin crawl to see her friend looking like a machine. It brings back bad memories, indeed.

"My friend, we are traveling in dreams because our world is a dream to them. And as we all know, what silly things dreams are." The Storyteller smiles sardonically. "Why should they give us any thought? But they will help anyway."

Egress arches an eyebrow. "That is not my usual style," says Egress. "I am very much founded on reality, I'm afraid. I hope this does have some value for us all, though."

"Your dreams for a better world are dreams too," the Storyteller says. Something catches his eye. "Look!" He points off the bow. "The moon comes. Tell your truth quickly, lest we fall off."

"I am my father's son," Davron says softly. A strangely emotive phrase, colored as it is by the light from inside him, but it seems heartfelt all the same.

Egress considers for a time, unsure of what to say. "With the fire of many hearts, I shall forge a better world," she murmurs at last.

The boat rocks gently. The sound of water splashing over the keel is no longer heard. Behind them, Creation's ocean pours over an edge - water, plunging an infinite distance into the darkness, makes the greatest waterfall ever witnessed. The small vessel sails into the void. "The world beyond the moon," the Storyteller remarks.

The Moon - Luna - drifts past the boat, distant, bright, and cold. And beyond it, Gaia, the Magic Moon, sparkles with its blue and green hues. Infinitely far, aglow with the promise of life, it stands on the other side of the passing coracle. The two orbs form a boundary of sorts, marking the coracle's departure from the circles of Creation.

The boat slows, and the Storyteller gestures. "Egress, look behind you." The Solar does. Trailing away from the coracle, out into the endless black depths of the void, is a chain. And it is fastened to her ankle with a thick manacle.

"You can go no further unless you surrender the waking world for a time," the ur-Sidereal cautions.

"Surrender the waking world?" asks Egress softly. "What does that mean? How long must I be drift out here? The world needs my attention."

"When you can surrender the world, such questions will no longer matter. But your dream - your truth - is to be found beyond."

"Faith demands faith," answers Egress. With a stomp of one foot, she shatters the chain. "I will go on."

The coracle sails on.

---

In the next moment - or perhaps after an eternity has passed - the little sailing vessel bumps against a sandy beach. The two Solars step off, and the Storyteller follows. Confronting them is a cliff of unlimited height - the face of a rock wall that stretches up without end. Clouds gather around it at a dizzying altitude, hiding whatever details of the cliff must lie above them. The Sidereal starts forward.

To the left and to the right the cliff continues as well, as does the beach. It is as though the maker of all things laid down a stone barrier across all existence, defying passage.

Egress approaches the cliff, holding out a hand as if to touch it. "What a curious place, to put so bland a barrier between us and whatever lies beyond," she says softly. "And yet somehow I know this cannot stop us. Or will not. Is that not strange?"

"It is not. But the stone will not give way for anyone who does not love stone," the Sidereal cautions.

He gestures at Davron, whose forearms and hands have become digging tools. "You must command your friend to make a tunnel."

Egress settles her hands against the stone. Freed of other things, she feels it as if for the first time. "It has the most amazing texture, doesn't it?" She looks back to Davron, her mind clearly distracted by what she feels. "Davron, dig us a tunnel so that we may see more of this stone, and learn more about this place."

Davron nods wordlessly, and his shovel-arms ram themselves into the rock repeatedly. Over and over he chips away at the rock, and the creaking and grinding grows louder, as if he were a machine made for digging.

Faster and faster the mechanical Exalt moves, until he is a blur of motion. Soon a spray of particles is emanating from the tunnel that he is making. Finally, the noise stops, and the Storyteller enters. Egress follows.

On the other side of the tunnel is a wide field, with a forest visible across a gently flowing river. Overhead, Luna's face shines down in a beautific smile. "The Moonlit Garden," the Sidereal whispers.

Egress takes her time going through the tunnel, stroking her hands over the rock before she finally enters the garden. Finally she looks up, admiring the face of Luna. "She's as beautiful here as ever," she whispers softly.

Davron does not hear Egress' words, though. A few paces beyond the tunnel mouth, his arms begin to slow. The grinding noise is much louder now, and as one arm moves forward, it stops with a loud **clunk**... and falls off. Gears and springs dribble from the stump, and as Davron's head turns to look at it, it too tumbles to the ground, smashing open and spilling a jumble of clockwork in all directions. Finally, the body topples over atop the head, likewise smashing, little screws pinging as they bounce into the distance.

Egress pauses to consider the remains of this dream form of Davron. Somehow, she is not afraid. It is, after all, so obviously absurd that a person should fall apart like that! "What has become of him?" she finally asks of the Storyteller.

The Storyteller walks forward as though nothing had happened. "We must make for the forest," he says.

Egress nods slowly. She bends down, plucking up a few of the springs and gears. "Then we should get moving now."

Across the water and into the woods the pair travel. Egress discerns the shadow of a draconic figure in flight - but for just a moment, as it flickers across the ground and picks up a brief breeze. "The Dragon God," the Storyteller murmurs. "Even on Gaia his name was known. Bahamut, Baphomet, Bahamod. We must hurry lest he dream of hunger."

Egress doesn't tarry there, moving on faster, though she wishes to see more of the dragon. "What is it we will see, Storyteller?" she asks softly. "This is such a strange place."

"We seek the Grove of Endless Wonderment," the man calls as he races. Through the trees and around - or over - bushes they run. The two Exalts skid to a stop in a grove, and Egress can feel the sacredness of the place suffusing her. "You are allowed to pick a fruit from the tree, but not to carry it away," he murmurs. Then leaning close, he whispers quietly. "When you eat it, do not swallow the seed. Do not swallow it, do you understand? We will fool the Treekeeper and escape."

At the center of this hollow place, three trees rise - one with gold leaves, another with silver, another with prismatic hues that dance gently in the moonlight.

Egress nods thoughtfully. She hasn't a clue what the seed shall do for her, but she will listen. "This is a most curious journey, indeed," she whispers. She considers the trees carefully, wondering aloud, "Do the trees differ in some meaningful way?"

"Only the Treekeeper knows," murmurs the Storyteller. "He is Halvah, the Tree of Life whom you met, but he will not remember you here. Go and pick fruit from the tree which calls to you."

Egress walks forward slowly, listening carefully. For a time, she hears nothing, feels nothing. "They are shy voices," she says at last, "but mine is a song that shall make all sing." Then, without any words at all, she begins to sing, mingling sounds and half-words as if they were the most natural thing in the world, her feet carrying her in a dance about the trees until at last she finds herself staring up at the bole of the silver tree. "In the light of the moon, silver seems to sing the most clearly to my eras." She reaches up then, seeking out a fruit.

The silvery fruit comes away from the branch easily. It seems in the shape of an apple, and glistens. "Eat it, quickly!" urges the Storyteller. "Remember my words! For Bahamut comes."

Egress is in the waking world would be appalled, but here she wolfs down the apple with a will, careful to trap the seed with her tongue, and hiding it in her mouth. She looks ready to run, thinking that Bahamut perhaps is best avoided.

Overhead, the shrill cry of the Dragon God is heard. It is a sound to end all sounds, the archetype of all dragons. To hear the voice is to feel the touch of death at one's throat; to feel the beast's breath must be death itself. Egress runs. The Storyteller is with her. The seed rests in her mouth, trapped carefully, for she cannot lose it. She feels the burning of the silver apple as it joins with her body's substance.

"He is too close! Your friend died for his dream, and now I will die for mine!" The Storyteller turns, Essence blazing from him. "Come, dragon!" he shouts to the sky, as the majestic creature wheels in the moonlit sky and bellows its primal rage. "Run, Egress!"

Egress remembers long ago hearing words to the effect that even the run ends. For now, though, it does not, and she flies with a speed she never thought she had before. Running until she feels just that wind, and the wonder of moving. Here, with things so distant, even the rush of flight from the dragon is not a thing of fear, but of excitement, of joy, for she lives still.

Through the tunnel she runs, hearing the Storyteller's voice fade suddenly behind her, hearing Bahamut bellow. Out onto the beach she emerges, confronting a sky of absolute gray, bounded by clouds. The coracle is there, and she leaps aboard. The wind surges to the rune as she stretches up her hand to receive it, and the lone Solar ventures once again into the dark.

---

The coracle is disintegrating. The sturdy little vessel, which passed beyond the moon and into uncharted realms beyond, is coming apart as it sails through empty space. Gaia and Luna, the sisters that guard the road to these nameless abysses beyond our familiar world, still stand far distant.

Egress looks over her vessel, unsure just what this means. She calls upon as much wind as she can, but she knows soon she will have to find a way without this faithful vessel. 'If I cannot ride, perhaps I can swim,' thinks Egress.

There is naught but void beneath the keel. If it is water, it is the lightest, most silent water in all of existence.

Letting out a soft sigh, Egress whispers, "What will be, will be." She looks ahead to Luna and to Gaia, praying for some sign, some guidance on what to do. Soon, though, it seems, that she shall have no choice at all. She opens her hands, finding one empty, and in the other, the springs and gears, all that is left of Davron. "At least I am not alone," she whispers. "If only you were here, you would patch together this poor ship and we'd find our way back.."

Something shivers in her hand, and Egress watches in fascination as the scattered remnants of Davron twist and grow themselves together. They begin to form a tiny man-like figure. It is not Davron, but Egress concludes after moments of watching it struggle to walk that it is something akin to his .. son.

The diminuitive thing leaps from her palm suddenly, moving about the coracle, applying segments of its own mechanical body to weld, stitch, or patch together the decaying watercraft. And it continues to sail, as the light of Gaia and the aura of Luna beckon.

Egress finds herself beginning to choke. The seed, so long held in her mouth, has begun to adhere to her throat, and her body grows more and more convulsed in rejecting it...

---

The Solar comes awake suddenly. It is Bridal Veil - home, for now - and she lies in her own bed. She's on her side, and with a final convulsion she spits out. What departs her mouth, bouncing twice off the wood floor, is a seed. And as she looks up, the Master can be seen, sitting in a comfortable chair with one leg crossed over his knee, watching her attentively.

Egress slowly looks up to the Master, then down the seed. With a voice far less smooth than normal, she says, "This was a dearly bought thing, indeed.. but is it not dangerous to take it from a thing so free as a dream?"

"I bring a message from Saturn, the Maiden of Endings," is all the Master says. "Perhaps it will answer that question." He withdraws a scroll from his robes and unfurls it, then begins to read.

"'Gallius - and now Egress, for Gallius has ended. You have visited my House many times in the past. What you have come away with on this occasion will aid you, but use it well. Mortality is man's price for dreaming, and even the Creation you love will disappear someday. Your dreams will end when they are fulfilled, like all dreams do, and you will find new dreams to replace them. When we speak again, I will demand my price from you. I hope that you will find yourself able to pay it gladly.'"

"I hope so as well," murmurs Egress quietly. "I fear there shall be many days between now and then, however. Such a very long road, it seems," she whispers. She takes the seed in her hands, cradling it carefully, "And I still do not know what this is, but a seed needs planting and care, and only then shall it reveal what it is."
