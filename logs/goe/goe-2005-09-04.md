# Gods of Eden 2005-09-04

With the recent successes working for Azel seeming to content the god for a time, the circle divides to see to tasks that are overdue. In the case of Egress, that means a very cool ride to the north atop Rain of Fire. Naturally Jin-nu comes along, unwilling to part from her friend. It is time to see that the Bull of the North achieves his dreams of conquest, and the Heirophant is prepared to use both her spear and her words to help him gain the victories he craves.

Ramar will travel with Egress as well. It has been some time since he's had the chance to spend time with Egress, and with his newfound confidence, he is rather insistant about getting to come along. "Besides, you never know, I might be useful."

Egress knows a thing or two about Yurgen's plans, and is pleased to see that he has stuck to them. "Now it is our turn to make good on our word." She directs Rain of Fire to follow the armies of the Bull of the North, for no great army can move with much stealth, especially when Egress already knows what their target shall be.

Yurgen Kaneko, the Bull of the North, is a Solar who won the respect of the Lunar Exalted early on. Now he is acting more than a little like a Lunar himself. He and his Circle have gained the alliance of many of the Icewalker tribes, the Ten Teeth of the Wolf, and many of the other powerful factions among the diffuse barbarians who eke out a living in the cold wastes.

Sorcery and spirit-binding allows the shamans of the tribes to speak to each other, whispering their messages into the Eternal Wind that blows through the North. This Lunar-allied god's emissaries present themselves to Egress and Ramar as they sail north, commanding that they come to Yurgen's encampment in the Gray Corpse Mountains.

"Tell the Bull of the North that the Lioness and her friends shall do as he asks," answers Egress. The hint of an upcoming battle sends a little thrill down her spine, and judging from the eagerness in Rain of Fire's eyes, the Solar is not the only one.

Rather than have Rain of Fire land on the outskirts of the camp, where the arrival will not make a great stir, Egress urges her friend to land in its midst, in a clearing that forms swiftly at the sight of the large dragon seeking to land. All about the clearing, rugged men and women gather, caring not that they might be outmatched, they show no fear. Egress slips off the back of her mount then, turning to help Jin-nu down next. "Where is the Bull of the North?" demands Egress flatly. "The Lioness is here." She imagines, though, that Yurgen is already very much aware of her presence.

Ramar guides the airship down in the wake of Rain of Fire and Egress. It is a slightly more subtle counterpoint to the magnificent arrival of the dragon. While Egress announces her presence to the Bull of the North, Ramar disembarks. He surveys the camp, impressed with the progress Yurgen's been making, and takes his place beside Egress, with little more than his presence to speak for his arrival.

The Gray Corpse Mountains are well-named. The standing stones that dot the steep, forbidding mountainside take uncomfortably human-like shapes when the sun is descending through the omnipresent mist that blankets the slopes. It is said that an army of Shogunate soldiers, in the time of the Seven Tigers, marched here against a force from the Underworld and were never seen again.

Still, in the midst of such a gloomy atmosphere, the tanned-hide tents of the Bull's forces and the stacks of spears and arrows show that life will persist in its struggles.

The camp the Solars find is nothing like that of the armies they've been with. There is no organization like that of the armies of the Nation of the Sun, nor even of the lines of spears and soldiers around Greyfalls so long ago. Instead tents are arranged wherever the warriors decided to settle them. Weapons are kept near at hand to their grizzled and scarred owners. Around fires is where most of the warriors are currently gathered, and though the camp is already very great, still more forces are streaming in.

The camp is a mix of scents. Most of all the smell of fire hangs heavy in the air, but also that of cooking meat and men and women who have been long away from a sweat tent.

A mud-crusted tent flap is thrown aside. The first thing to be seen poking out of it is Yurgen's bearded, lined face. It's cast into a scowl, and as he hauls his widely-built frame out of the tent and strides purposefully across the rocky ground, it doesn't get any prettier. "You lot!" he bellows. "Come to see what I've been doing, eh?"

"We figured we might as well," says Egress. She laughs and moves more quickly towards Yurgen, "It's good to see you are as happy as ever to see me, Bull of the North." She looks around and sighs, "I thought you would have a war on, but right now it appears you are just a travelling festival." More seriously she says, "When I said I would repay your help to us I wasn't just making empty promises. I come to do all I can in what time I have, and I shall do so again, until things are settled."

"Fine," snaps Yurgen. "Kill the Ghastly for me."

"The Ghastly?" asks Egress. "Who is this that you would have us kill? With a name like that, it would sound rather like one of the servants of the Deathlords, but perhaps my guess is wide of the mark?"

"Yer correct," Yurgen replies, as taciturn as before. "The Bishop's answer to Juggernaut." These names are known; the Bishop of the Chalcedony Thurible is a Deathlord who makes his home in the North, while Juggernaut is the great dead beast of the Mask of Winters, a mobile undead fortress.

"That sounds like a very great battle indeed," replies Egress. She is just as glad that she has brought many apples with her, and her spear as well. "It's not quite what I expected you to request, but I will see it done, or die in the attempt."

"Defeat a behemoth..." Ramar muses, "Is that all. Well then, I wonder, do you know anything about it? Anything that might help us to defeat it for once and for all?"

"It's big and it's dead," the Solar barbarian grunts.

"We'll just have to put it to a proper and very final rest," says Egress. "At least we should have no trouble finding it, right?" She laughs softly, though she knows very well just how dangerous this is likely to become.

"Right. Well then let's go see what we can do about defeating this thing..." Ramar nods, "Glad to be of help, it's good seeing you, as always."

"One more thing. The Winter Folk are prowling about. Don't let them take you," Yurgen advises.

Egress has learned very little about the nature of her foe, except by comparison. If this thing is the answer to Juggernaut, she's not going to be stopping it with her spear. Probably not with ten thousand spears, at that. Luckily destiny has provided her with something else. A pair of enemies very unlikely to take kindly to each other and a friend who can gain her passage to one who might assist her. "Ramar, we are going to speak with these Winter Folk and see if they might be interested in handling this problem. Are you prepared to go on a journey of diplomacy?"

"Certainly," says Ramar. The prospect of visiting the winter Folk gives him a little ominous feeling, given Yurgen's earlier warning... but the consequences if the Ghastly is left free are too great to let this smaller risk hold anything up. "It'll be interesting to see how the Northern Fair Folk are... but we'll have to be exceptionally careful here... I wouldn't want anything to happen to you," he admits. "So let's get going, and see what we can find out."

It seems rather impolite to ride to a diplomatic mission bearing weapons specifically made to kill the one you are visiting, and so Egress will suggest to Ramar that they ride Rain of Fire off to visit their unlikely friends. If friend is even the right word.

The sky above the North is grey and empty, largely devoid of life and bright light. While snow and ice gather beneath clouds as thick as thieves, Rain of Fire soars above, bearing two riders upon her back. Ramar, for all his exilhiration at flight, seems to be holding onto Egress rather tightly. Essence gathers around the chilled Solar, reaffirming the reality around him as they descend beneath the dark clouds, and into the Wyld realms of the Winter Folk. Ice and snow take on dazzling dreamlike shapes here and there where Wyld and Creation meet.

They have traveled beyond Yurgen's settlements, beyond the places where even the rugged beastmen will dwell. Craggy mountains have given way to endless plains of ice, ice that takes on an unearthly sheen when viewed from Rain of Fire's back... out here there is little more than a slow, steady gathering of frost to affirm Creation's existence. Here the borders of reality weaken, and the Wyld sets in.

Wind picks up around them, wind not created by Rain of Fire's wings. Snow seems almost intent on blinding their path. Falling steadily, though the snowflakes themselves change before their eyes. From crystals sharp enough to cut the air, to harmless little motes of light dancing off of Ramar's cloak... Essence protects them, creating a wake of truth, as it were. They have not come far, when Ramar signals for Rain of Fire to stop, "Let's see if we can find someone..."

A castle of ice and mist rises from the terrain, and a wide area in the bailey seems to permit landing. On the battlements, and in the courtyard, elegantly-attired figures move like animated game-pieces.

Egress stays near Ramar, since her martial prowess isn't going to get them safe passage here. She slips from the back of Rain of Fire, looking about the castle slowly from the bailey in which they landed. "Show us to your commander," she calls out clearly. She idly wonders if that makes any sense to the Fair Folk. She wonders also whether Fair Folk even have commanders.

The pretty, deadly weapons that were raised by the beautiful soldiers lower as Ramar's Caste Mark flares to life, and the half-androgynous men's eyes narrow under their swan-sculpted helmets. "Come with me," one commands, and wheeling, he strides with martial precision toward the great tower that marks the heart of the castle.

Egress nods to the warrior, following him closely. She does not expect any treachery, however. Somehow Ramar's caste has a special way with them, and though she doesn't truly understand why, it works well enough. Or has thus far, and so she will trust her life to it.

Inside the castle it is beautiful, and cold. The frozen bodies of beautiful young men and women are locked inside intricate ice sculptures, and these form the principal decorations of the castle. Elsewhere, the Solar pair passes a sort of staged display. They can tell it is the depiction of a battle of some kind, in which the Fair Folk are riding out against the dead. But they can also tell that the warriors depicted are real hobgoblins. Actual Fair Folk commoners are standing still, holding as rigidly as they can, in the positions the tableau depicts. And the shuffling zombies moving to meet them are actual undead, albeit held in place by potent glamour. How long have they been like this?

Further in is the throne room, and on the throne sits a white queen of fierce attractiveness, of wild and terrible beauty. Her scepter is the thighbone of a man, and her crown a carven skull. Her robes are woven of ice, and she is adorned by a cloak made entirely of frozen human hands, sewn together like a sort of rough chain-mail.

The White Queen rises, eyes flashing, and the soldiers abase themselves before her. And she smiles, licking her lips.

The Lioness looks at the White Queen curiously, bowing politely to her. She isn't sure just what title is appropriate, but the scepter and robes seem to make it more clear. "My name is Egress, thank you for allowing us this audience."

"I am the White Queen," says the White Queen, for she could bear no other title, and that title could not be borne by another. "I am she who quells the barbarians, who holds back the dead, who takes tribute from the gods themselves."

Egress has been thinking a great deal about how to use this meeting to help her attain her goals. "Oh Great White Queen, I fear I must deny at least one of your titles, for among the dead there is one beast that you do not hold at bay. In fact, I have come here to speak of this creature. You must know well the best called the Ghastly."

"That is its name among man. We know the older name. The Ghastly Abomination Which Crawls in the Belly of the Air Dragon. Men have.... less time to speak such things, before the screaming starts." The White Queen smiles. "It is a burrowing creature, a 'Behemoth', the first, last and only of its kind. It died during a hunt conducted in your First Age, led by your Solar Exalted."

"And we wish to hunt it again," says Egress. "But our First Age was a very long time ago through our eyes, and I fear, White Queen, that we have not the means to put down such a creature. I trust, however, that with my talents and that of my friends, the White Queen may finally defeat this beast and gain great renown."

"I would invite the wrath of the Bishop. Your scheme is transparent to me. You wish me to make war when you declare, not when I wish."

"I do not think it shall come to that," says Egress. "I think the White Queen need not involve herself in a way that shall bring reprisals. Instead, I would like information about the behemoth. My Circle has seen many times that these beasts are each unique, and knowledge of their nature is more valuable than ten thousand lances against them."

"Foolish child," the Queen demurs. "The Bishop's necromancy controls it now. It is just a corpse, and whatever weaknesses it had in life are the harness it wears in death. But I should like to challenge the Bishop regardless..." Her eyes grow narrow, and cruel, and she rises from the throne and flashes forward, standing within a yard of Egress before one beat of the heart registers among the Solars.

The suddenness of her motion is surprising, but not startling, and Egress retains her wits well enough, as the Queen speaks further. "Are you such a mewling kitten that you wish to strike this thing from the back, then run back to your comfortable south? Tell me!"

Egress narrows her eyes in turn. "North, east, west, and south, all ways do my eyes turn. The White Queen may rule in this land, but all lands shall be reminded that they bow to the Deliberative." The time for hiding has clearly passed, and the Lioness' patience seems absent. "I have no home, for all Creation is the province of the Heirophant, and though this distance land may seem almost beneath notice to those who divert all their attention on the Realm, I must do what I can to destroy our enemies wherever they might be found."

An almost sexual display of gratification washes over the Queen's symmetrically flawless features, and she lets out a long sigh. The skin of Egress' face feels the chill of it, so close is she. "Yes...yess," she murmurs. Then her voice is again the cold of forged steel. "Destroy your enemies. Crush them before you. The Behemoth is your enemy. The Bishop is your enemy. I am your enemy!" She shouts these final words, arms upraised, fingernails carving like talons at the air as though she meant to shred the sky itself. "Fight! Kill! Take. Now, tell me of this war!"

"Perhaps you are, but the stage for our battle has not yet been built," says Egress. She is gaining a sense of understanding of this Queen. Perhaps because she sees something of a mirror of part of her nature. A frightening, distorted mirror, at that. "The war I speak of shall leave the white north red with blood, and it has just begun. My part in this battle is to see the Ghastly destroyed, and is shall be done. If the Heirophant is asked to remove an obstacle, it must be removed. I have come here because I believed that my objective was something you also desired to achieve, White Queen."

Snow and ice begin to rise in the frozen castle's throne room, as the Queen gathers her power. "Yes, tell me more!" she commands. "Tell me of the disposition of my troops! Tell me what forces the Bishop commands!"

Egress pauses, considering for just a moment. "The zombie forces of the Bishop are arrayed in black lines, standing out as wavering shadows of gray through the swirling blizzard," she chants. "Arrayed against them, standing tall and terribly beautiful are the forces of the White Queen, light against shadow, their lances glittering like ten thousand stars as she are set ready." Egress pauses, "For a moment, the only sound is the wind, the snow swirling thick as smoke."

"The advance is called, the battle joined, silver against ebony in the storm." Egress lets out a gentle sigh, and her voice grows more dreamy as she goes on, delivering the details of battle calmly one moment, and then, when the action is most bitter and dangerous, with a sensual purr one would expect only from one of the pleasure houses of Nexus.

"The battle hangs by a thread," whispers Egress, her face moving so her warm breath teases against the queen's ear. "The Bishop, sensing this critical moment, throws at last the weapon of greatest terror into the fight." She continues chanting into the ear of the White Queen, speaking of the most terrible battle of all, with the undead behemoth ringed in foes, steel like icicles tearing through its flesh as wave after wave of knights are sent against the terrible beast.

The power of the Fair Folk engulfs Egress and the White Queen. Stinging ice-shards streak through the entire throne room, and more than once the Solar feels her flesh struck, or even cut open, by the deadly cold ice crystals. Still she tells on, and still the White Queen shrieks her demands - tales of the bravery of her warriors, stories of the regal Deathknights who serve the Bishop, the legends that will be told as the Fair Folk Host marches on Ghastly. And still Egress tells on.

The Heirophant feels her flesh torn and frozen, her eyes shutting to protect them from the ice. Still demands are made of her, diverging wildly due to the whimsy of the White Queen. The tales of the every Deathknight are unwoven, each a story to make stones weep and terrible enough to stoke rage into the most merciful heart. On it goes, to the great feast of victory that shall come when the battle is won, and the songs that men shall sing of the day of of the Great Northern War are not left out. Even with her throat nearly frozen, her voicing cracking like ice, Egress continues to tell the tales the White Queen would here, delivering now in the rhyming forms of her own people, then in the long meters of the classics, and then in free verses, each punctuated with sadness, glory, wrath, and the joy of killing.

Egress draws upon every drop of skill she has, her divine talents for story and song leading her to tell tales of the land the battle is fought upon, drifting back in time to its initial carving from the Wyld, before the time of the Gods, when the Primordials were masters of Creation. On and on the tale goes, touching upon the future rise of the White Queen as a power of the north and her terrible and final victory over the Bishop. In the end, even the strength of Egress must waver and trailing off into silence, the Zenith feels her legs weaken and finally give out entirely, sending her toppling down.

As the Solar falls, the Queen exults. "A glorious tale!" she shouts. "I will it to be so!" And the entire Castle shudders as her power roils forth, coating everything in a frosting of white...

Egress wakes to find herself being hauled aloft on the back of her draconic mount, secured by Ramar. Below her, the gray-black of the northern mountains. Ahead of her, war.
