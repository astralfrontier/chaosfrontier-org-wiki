# Gods of Eden 2005-09-10

In the Northwest, there is a plateau that is largely uninhabited. It is protected by groups of beastmen and their barbaric allies, though they rarely venture to the top. Atop this plateau, where ice gathers with all the slow inevitable force of a behemoth, a group of Lunars make their home. With little ceremony a messenger appears at the Lunar encampment. He arrives on alabaster wings, and steps away from the statue. For such a cold place, this person is dressed rather easily, with nothing in the way of furs or heavy clothes to protect him from the cold. A flash of golden light atop his brow and a few frozen words gains him an audience with one of the Lunars. There is a lengthy discussion before the messenger departs for warmer climes.

The next stop is a somewhat somber place. A place of bittersweet memories from darker days still too recent for some. Once more alabaster touches down and a lone figure makes for the cottage. He knocks, enters, and makes mention that the cottage's occupant might make use of some time away from this place. There's further discussion of great works of wonder, before the messenger leaves, this time headed for the West. For Gilthane's island-nations.

Gilthane is somewhat more difficult to get in contact with. It takes time to arrange an audience without necessarily revealing everything. No hint of anything with regards to the existence of Solars is made, at least until Gilthane is able to converse with the messenger. He explains that a vision has been shown to him, a dream of a place of learning and wonder, hidden from the wayward eyes of the world and its enemies. Hours roll by, then, the messenger departs, traversing to hidden parts of the island and then heading back from whence he came.

It has been a while since anyone else has been to Rumika's island. Now there's a bustling to the place as visitors begin to arrive. Rumika is there first, since it is after all, her island. Ramar follows soon after, and waits, "Now we shall see who else has decided that it's worth their while to show up."

Even in the midst of the Citadel project, Davron was intrigued when he heard about Ramar's latest project. Although the bashful smile he gives Rumika when he arrives may suggest that he had other motivations for joining the expedition, the fact of the matter is that sorcerous learning is just as dear to his heart as anything else you could name.

Rumika's island has not forgotten its mistress, and though she has long been away, her touch has not been forgotten. Nor has the seed she sowed been utterly lost from the world, for life, once given form, fights on with its own will. Though her daughters are lost to her, save in the reflection that lives on in Egress, there are their offspring here, now grown enough to dart about, warily watching as Rumika strides towards her old home in the manse, and then, sure of who it is, they dart forward, no less than six of them surrounding her, their voices chittering in a happy babble. They gesture wildly about the island, clearly trying to explain all at once all of the things that have grown while she was away.

Of course, there are others, more shy, that see their maker surrounded and instead creep up on the others who have come with her. Ramar finds himself with a small child, her eyes a vibrant ingido, pulling at his clothes. Once noticed, she smiles shyly and giggles, offering up to him a flower with petals of shining crystal.

No less than two more are working on some sort of drawing with paper, quill, and ink from the native squid of the waters in this region. One stands, nodding to the other, and trots forward to tug on Rumika's sleeve. The paper is duly presented for inspection. On it is the drawing of a crater, with broad strokes around it representing a child's idea of chaos. Nearby it, the drawing depicts a vaguely human outline that has no details - merely a solid stain of black ink. At the center are two smiling figures holding hands, surmounted by large wings.

Rumika looks over the drawing with a smile, reaching down to stroke the head of the little ones that drew it. "This is very good," she says warmly. "Have you been dreaming? I think my friends will like what you have drawn very much." She looks over to Ramar and Davron then, motioning for them to come near and see the drawing.

Ramar takes an interest as Rumika motions him over. With crystal flower in hand he takes notice of the drawing that has been made, "Yes, Rumika? What is it?" He studies the drawing carefully for a bit...

Davron tilts his head, his brow furrowing. "How curious..." He glances at the others. "A stable island in the Wyld, I'd guess..." He isn't entirely sure what to make of it just yet, but if Rumika believes her offspring are prone to clairvoyant dreams, he respects her judgment.

Rumika arches an eyebrow, "This is where we must go," she says. She shakes her head, "I forget that though you are strong, you are still young." Her laughter is not teasing, but soft and for the first time in so long, joyful. "My children have seen where it is we must go. Don't you see? Look more closely, now." And here she hands over the drawing to the two Solars so she might turn her mind back to her little ones.

"Yes... I do see. Though I'm not sure I like where it is we have to go... we need to visit the place of... of the battle where we faced a great and terrible foe." There's a pained look in Ramar's eyes when he expresses this. When he explains just what he believes the drawing to mean. "That crater is all too familiar... still... we should go and see what we can learn. That other figure... perhaps this means we need to track down Egress? I don't know."

Davron blinks, and refocuses as Ramar's words clarify what he is seeing, and he blushing in shame at his failure to comprehend the drawing's significance. "I suppose... we would need to go there to find out," he says, finally.

Rumika looks the drawing over and for a moment, the joy falters. "I am afraid you are right," she murmurs. "It's not what I wished it to be.. how can I tell them the truth? Perhaps they already have seen it." She looks at the children, and realizes that the raising of the children shall be always be bittersweet since their mothers are lost. She lets the little ones dart off to play, then, eager to focus her mind elsewhere once more. "So how long shall the others be?" she asks.

"I'm not sure when the others will arrive. I don't think I have it quite right. Perhaps one of you two can figure out why this would be important. The location might not be the central issue..." Ramar thinks on this for a bit, trying to figure out what it means.

For a time the little group dwells on what this could mean. In due course, two other groups arrive: Gilthane and one of his assistants, who he introduces as Virtue and who wears an eyepatch of blue jade, and later a Lunar Full Moon, calling herself Rena, the Monster of Shuro Bay. She accompanies a silent No Moon whom she introduces as the Ten Thousand Master. They are here in response to Ramar's summons.

"I'm glad you could make it," greets Ramar, while he adds a touch of informality. He sees to introductions and proceeds to outline his plan. "I believe our best chance lies under the waves of the Western ocean, someplace deep and forgotten, where we can make a home and protect it... I have some knowledge that will help with this. With it we can make use of a group of Manses more efficaciously. I think those of you who are most familiar with those places can help us find the ideal spot..."

The Solar continues. He explains his vision for the sanctuary beneath the waves. How they might establish gates similar to Yu-Shan to move swiftly between the sanctuary and the outside world, and how they can preserve and discover new sorcerous knowledge therein. The plan is simple, first those familiar with the areas Ramar has in mind, will aid the others in scouting out the location... He goes on explaining the plan, making sure that all shall contribute to the plan and all shall benefit from it's fruition as best as is possible.

There's a small amount of hesitation as Ramar explains the true benefits of this accomplishment. Before the truth of Solar Sorcery is revealed, Ramar will explain to all present that the greatest of care ie necessary with what he will reveal. He continues then, informing them of the heights of sorcery that they might be able to reach with the right goal. The beastmen of the Ten Thousand Master will be improved, readily, and more... there is the promise that this power will go to hold off the Deathlords, to keep them from devouring the world.

After Ramar explains why they should help, he once again details how they can. And when the task is to begin, and he will go over the details of the ritual involved, as he will need the help of five others to accomplish this great work. Preparations are made, protection established for those who need aid in travelling out to where they are headed, until at last they can rest to set out on what should be quite the journey.

Rumika turns to the Lunars after Ramar has made his case, her interest more in them right now than her Solar cousins. She asks them carefully about the loss of the Castes, and suggests that her greatest drive is in life and in healing, and how she wishes to offer her talents-which surely shall grow greatly-to aid them in whatever ways they will allow. She knows the distance between the Solars and Lunars is great still, and wishes to mend that illness as well.

The last suggestion from Rumika brings a bristling of insulted fury from Rena, but the Ten Thousand Master quiets his companion with a mere shake of his head. In other regards, Gil, Virtue, the two Lunars, Davron, and Rumika, should be enough to perform the rite. Rena knows the waters of the West from long experience in them, and Gilthane knows the shipping routes to avoid - for he controls a fair portion of them, indirectly. He further hints that he can find places that the Silver Prince - ruler of Onyx - will not be looking.

"With my Legend-Mining Technique, I came across this place," Gilthane explains from the deck of his sailing ship, the _Hidden Plenty_. "Centuries ago, a fishing village here found a beautiful rock that washed up on the shore unlike any they had seen. It was a good luck talisman according to the shaman, who promptly told the villagers to encase it in ceramic and set it up as a taboo statue near the shore. He knew, as I learned when I broke that statue open, that it was a Hearthstone, and I think it came from under the water. It should be somewhere below where we are now."

"I see. Sounds like a good place to start looking then..." says Ramar. "Do you know, by any chance, if there's anything down there that's shall we say, looking after the place?"

"Village never had a problem hanging onto the Hearthstone," remarks Gil, off-handedly. "I'd say if so, that they didn't care. Care to find out?"

Ramar grins at that, "Thought you'd never ask. Let's get going..."

Davron nods. "Then we might as well get started," he remarks. "Show me the Hearthstone for a moment?" The magical gemstone is duly produced, and Davron invokes the sorcery that he first learned in an unimaginably distant land. Soon, the familiar sparrow of fire is circling around the Hearthstone, its fluttering dance pointing the way across the waves.

Across and beneath the waves, the Exalts are led. Between the group there is enough in the way of magic to ensure that everyone is protected and able to traverse beneath the surface. Slowly but surely the sunlight fades, and the terrain grows darker. The light produced by the sparrow is eerie and wavering beneath the waves, yet it leads on, unerringly pointing the way to the Manse.

It takes some getting used to being able to move so freely in the water. The sparrow flits about until it begins to proceed directly down. The water darkens and the pressure of the deeps exerts itself, slowing their descent just slightly. Here, the power of the Exalts keeps them from being crushed, and soon clouds of sand swirl about their feet as they touch on the sandy bottom of the ocean.

Through clouds of dark sand they proceed, walking past things not seen by mortal man for centuries. Here and there, the landscape is dotted with wrecks of ships of old, the designs archaic or possibly arcane, damaged through battle or worse. Fish swim away as the Exalts progress further. And then things grow brighter. The water seems to waver here and there, growing somehow more real as they notice structures jutting out from within the sand. The sparrow continues, and then they can make out the shadowy shape of the sunken Manse just up ahead. Ready. Waiting.

The Manse waits patiently, as it has for centuries. When the Exalts approach it, there is a soft grinding of stone upon stone. A single set of doors opens and they step in, with the large Manse doors closing, sealing them in a room. The water drains, and they are able to make it inside the rather dry Manse. Glass, at least as strong as that in Chiaroscuro, protects them, and lets them see out as they make their way through to the Hearthstone Chamber. "Good. This is a good place to start. It's not quite capped to it's full potential... but that will be fixed shortly..." says Ramar.

Rumika is mostly silent, her mind drifting far from this place, captured by the life she has seen filling the world beneath the waves. The healer and life giver cannot help but think of what she might be able to create under the waters. Still, there is the task at hand, and she hopes she can prove useful still.

The first task at hand is to raise the center point so that it is the highest in the region. The Exalts who cannot directly raise the Manse, search to make sure that the measurements are correct. To ensure that the spell will go off with as little difficulty as is possible. When this great work is complete, the next is to fashion the five statues that will form the boundaries of the Sanctuary. This is a lengthy process, requiring a harvest of exotic materials from the surrounding terrains. Five days pass. The last of the statues is complete. "When the time comes, you must place them in the corners of the area we've outlined," says Ramar. "You will know when you have found the proper place."

It begins simply. Ramar stands atop the Manse, as at home under the water as above it. Around him, the Ten Thousand Master and Gilthane work their sorcery, aided by Rumika and Davron's occult knowledge to ward the area. To try and keep it safe from scrying, from someone viewing the area, even after the great sorcery has been completed. It is nearly sundown when their task his complete. The last rays of sunlight are disappearing beyond the horizon, miles above them, where their ship waits patiently. Ramar gestures with outstretched hands, calling to his side the very currents of the depths. Water swirls slowly around him, his clothing billows in the glow of Essence as it flows through his body. The Manse glimmers briefly, and around Ramar, his Caste Mark grows brighter and brighter until it's light seems to swallow him, leaving him bathed in Essence. Mandalas, ancient scriptures, truths long forgotten surround the Solar, whose very voice seems to shake the water as he bids his allies to place the statue

One by one the statues are positioned in the exact corner of the realm that is to become the Solar Sanctuary. It has taken no small amount of geomancy to determine these locations, and now the efforts are paid off... with the first statue in place, a beam of light stretches through the waves, reaching for the heavens. A second blinding beam joins them, then a third, then a fourth, then the fifth. When all five lances of light are visible, Ramar begins to chant. His voice is ancient and powerful as he chants an incantation not spoken on Creation for centuries. When he finishes, the beams of light begin to shift and bend towards him, meeting high above his body. Light seems to leap from Ramar to the apex of the beams of light, as a bright dome now encloses the area marked by the statues. It is then that the ground begins to quake.

Beneath Ramar's feet, the Manse begins to shift and grow. Architecture twists in on itself, blooming outward and crumbling where it is inadequate. In the wake of this change is a new Manse. A Manse that fully caps the Demense beneath it. And several yards off, the same happens to another. The ground bursts as the holy place is washed over with mystic energy. Jade, Orichalcum, Marble, Iron... all of these things hidden in Creation now spring forth, rumbling upwards as though buried, to channel the energy of this sacred sanctuary. Any Demense left untouched is capped, as a Manse rises from the ocean's floor at Ramar's command.

Even through the clouds of dust thrown into the water by the rising of the megalithic architecture, the light of the dome can be seen, providing a beacon of hope to Ramar's allies. They know that soon all shall settle, and this new Sanctuary will be complete. By the time the dust has settled, the Sanctuary has been formed, and Ramar waits inside the Hearthstone chamber of the new Manse, nearly spent from effort, but looking pleased, buoyed by the success of the endeavour.

It does not take long for the power of the Sanctuary to become apparent. Though the spell was costly, within an hour, Ramar is nearly recovered from the effort of channeling so much Essence, so difficultly. The others will feel it as well, Essence flowing to their bodies, recharging. Ramar sits within the Hearthstone chamber, peering through the eyes of the statues, and then back to the rest of the Exalts gathered near him. "It's done... within the next few days we'll be able to discern the Hearthstones, and after that... the real work can begin."
