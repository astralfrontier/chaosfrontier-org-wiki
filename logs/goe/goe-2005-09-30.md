# Gods of Eden 2005-09-30

With the three ships pacified, Egress calls out to the captains, "Draw your men from the sea. Call them back to the ships now! We must speak about these spoils and the future of your house." The anima above the Zenith no longer rears and glares, but stands proudly, the winged lion looking down like a queen upon her subjects.

The orders of Egress are obeyed swiftly, though the final result is in doubt. Egress looks ready, waiting to prove once again that she will accept no trouble from these Dragon Blooded, no matter their house or cause. She looks to her circle mates, expecting them to be prepared as well. It is unlikely this shall be a peaceful meeting. The Zenith does not worry much over this. Authority does not exist without power to enforce its will. Combat is simply the most primitive way to demonstrate such power, but it is the way that most understand the best.

The divers of House Ragara, nobles all, are brought aboard the three ships. While they are drying themselves off, it is made clear the relationship: the captains are subservient to these men, and stay on the surface while the true authorities of the expedition do the diving. It is also made clear that the Circle performing this work functions on a democratic basis - a majority vote is required for any major action.

Egress recognizes the real authority on these ships when she sees it. She speaks to the divers honestly, knowing that any lies or trickery is pointless. "House Ragara has come to seize the treasures of Azel, and with the blessing of Truk Trin, may have done so," she begins. "However, Azel is mighty as well, and has turned to her own champion. It is not our own battle we wage here, but that of the gods. If you think you can take what you wish from the sea, you are quite mistaken." She lets those words sink in before continuing, "Your only hope of seeing the least bit of treasure from this great store is to give us cause to aid you, rather than stop this expedition here and now."

"Fortunately, we also have an interest in this city, and would see that its bounty is not left on the bottom of the seas, worthless and unused," continues Egress. "But we are not allies of the Realm, whose strength has floundered as pettiness and idle pleasures softened its conviction. Still, there might be hope of some understanding, and it may well profit House Ragara, if they are truly interested in taking a leading roll in the great deeds to come."

The words of the Solar ripple out like waves, her faith a force that is not just heard, but felt. To the Solars, it comes as a thrill, like a cold water flowing down the spine. To the Dragon Blooded, it feels far different. There is a natural resistance, as centuries of deceit have made these exalts forget the promises they once made. Still, those promises were not simple words, but are truths that echo through the ages, and at the words of the Zenith, they begin to be felt again. To some, three is a feeling of bleak terror, and these can do little but simply shut out the words, unable to accept what they feel. To others, there is a promise of great deeds, of glory and honor that can only come when one lives exactly as they are meant to.

In all, though, fear or acceptance alike, there is a sense of the power of the Solars. The Dragon Blooded heroes who have strayed so far from the path suddenly see it again, to follow or to fall forever away. The mortals gape, most of them having never seen a Solar up close. They have lived and worked and fought with the Dragon-Blooded many times, but here, in the face of the enemy, they feel their faith waver and being to break, taken utterly in by the words of the Zenith, embracing her faith and praying that she will continue to speak.

Egress turns away and raises a hand over the sea. "The Champion of Azel shall not rob her coffers like a thief in the night. Solars need not skulk. We shall lift from the arms of Azel this treasure and with it bring her glory, raising it not to the level of the cities of men, but to the very skies, where it shall house the true Deliberative, and where the future of Creation itself shall be decided." She turns then to regard those standing with her, "All of you who will follow me shall know glory, honor, and purpose. Never again will you wonder what you are meant to do. Never again will you doubt that you are living the life you were born to live! If you follow me, here and now, by that act of faith alone your names shall be remembered long after this age passes!"

Chi-Yosh cannot clap, for such a small gesture is not worthy of the words spared by Egress. But what he can do is beam in pride for being represented by her, spoken for by her, his duty held up by the Zenith. It is she that holds true to the deal he offered and to the loyalty he swore. And now he must go, to return the favor, and see that her ideals are made possible.

The Dragon-Blooded would laugh at such a thought. To lift a whole city! Absurd. They would laugh, if they had not already felt the force of mere words from the Zenith. They look at her allies, whose powers have yet to be revealed. There is a fear there, in those who still reject the promises, who cling to their lies and so know ever stronger despair. But they are not the majority. The mortals are utterly swayed, most of them standing perfectly still, all attention focused on the Zenith. Were she to tell them her circle was going to climb the sky and pluck from it every star, they would not doubt it in the least. The Dragon-Blooded who embrace the words do not feel the same as the mortals. In their hearts is a longing to be part of this great work, to throw themselves at the task with a will and see the promises of the Zenith all come to fruition.

After the matter is settled with the Dragon-Blooded, Chi-Yosh and Ramar take to the air. It tatkes them nearly a day to reach the door to Yu-Shan. Ramar assists the Su'Katan inside, and the Solar makes a quick path to the Court of Water, where the office of the Keeper the Antiquities of the Sea recides. He is breezed into Azel's office after his identity is bared to the front desk.

Chi-Yosh bows before the goddess, before clearing his throat. "I bring to you news that I have devised an unorthodox method of handling my first mission. I have found a way to honor you, spread your influence and elevate your notice," a small smile finds him at the irony of that, "And spread my own glory and power in one grand gesture."

Chi-Yosh says, "The city you have sent me to avenge is that of Gaugamela, aquatic citadel of the great Twilight Narus. It was lost in a titanic battle with an insane Solar. But before that, as a city of the First Age, much of the property belonged to the Deliberative. And a man who drops something in the sea has the right to dive in and look before it is lost. As a member of the Deliberative, I ask you permission to reclaim that which is once ours. Not the antiquities within, but the _city itself_. My Circle would like to return it to the surface and make Gaugamela the new capital of the Deliberative."

The Exalt continues, "In doing so, you will be giving the Deliberative a new home, and will have a large temple within the city dedicated to you. It will give me glory for not only finding, but winning the Ragarra looters and converting them into followers. In addition to pittance; priceless wealth added to the troves you keep in the sea. I ask of you permission, and the deed to Gaugamela."

Azel chuckles a bit as she reclines in her Celestial abode. "The city would no longer be a problem for me, is what you're saying?" she asks. "Well, I'm glad of that. I couldn't have confronted the Realm without an agent like yourself, and technically this'll win me my bet with Garvas, so...... I approve." The spirit clears her throat and continues. "HOWEVER! I have a condition."

"You've met the Outcaste Pirates, Eos and Ossissa." Azel leans forward. "Convince them to burn the Guild ships they take - that shouldn't be hard with Eos - and dedicate those victories to me. Fifteen ships will satisfy me, and I'll see to it that the spawn of Sesus gets what he _really_ wants."

Chi-Yosh cants his head in consideration. "That should not be a hard challenge, unless they also harbor displeasure for the gods. Their piracy adds more to your domain than many." A bow. "Consider it done, Azel. It will be good to see my associates once more."

Satisfied with the way events have turned, Egress orders the ships to return so she might meet with the rest of their fleet. The harbor of Whitefoam is a small but functional port town, and it has served as the main launching point for the expeditions of House Ragara. With the return of four ships instead of three, one of which is badly damaged and another that is flying, there is a great deal of commotion. In short order, however, the captains are summoned with their crews to hear the words of the Zenith.

As before, the faith of the Solar pours out in her words. If anything, its intensity is greater than before, greatly enhanced with the positive influence of those she has already swayed. Listening once more, some who rejected her words the first time waver in their resistance, seeing so many of their fellows, men and women they have respected, accept the words of Egress. There is no deception, no honeyed promises of ease or laziness. There is only a feeling that somehow, just by accepting these words, that things shall turn out right. It is as if the universe suddenly made sense, after a life of frustration and idle regrets. The way to the future is laid bare, and all they need do is stop resisting it and step forward.

Still, some hearts are kept hard, shutting out the words, though it seems to only lead to sadness and a feeling of wrongness. There is no easy measuring stick in who does and who does not accept the hope that is offered. The elders and the youth both have equal opportunity and have their own reasons. In the end, most of the Dragon-Blooded open that door, and embrace these words. The loyalties to their house are of course not forgotten, but a new way to enrich their people now exists, and they are anxious to see it through. The past cannot return exactly as it was, but there is suddenly a strong hope that the future shall be brighter than any days they have seen.

The Twilight engineers and their newfound Dragon-Blooded allies sink into the depths, wrapped in their viridian mantles. It is sooner than they'd anticipated, but plans have already been made, and some of the prototype lifting engines are already partially constructed; these mechanisms sink rather faster than the rest, their crews hanging on by the handles, waiting until they near the sea bottom to turn them on briefly to slow their descent.

Arianna, in particular, was especially uneasy; her long-standing fear and hatred of the Wyld Hunt is not easily forgotten. Ramar, noticing this, sees to it that Arianna has plenty of engineering tasks to keep her occupied; from his experience with Davron, he's learned that nothing distracts a Copper Spider like an intellectual challenge.

It is dark down here, but the Solars' Caste Marks pierce the darkness, along with the glowing globes on the helmets of House Ragara. Though the city is wreathed in shadows, it is illuminated for the second time in centuries. The teams fan out, drifting along the seaweed-strewn byways on their assigned tasks - the earlier Ragaran expedition having provided invaluable intelligence.

And it is a team of Ragarans who first discover the remains of the factory-cathedral; heirs to the Elemental Dragon of Water, they are the most maneuverable and the least unencumbered in the pelagic depths, their Quickly they swim to alert the others, and they converge, half-built engines emitting a faint glow as they're carried along. Davron regards the facility with mingled awe and dismay; his predecessors had built to last, but after centuries of inattention, the great doors were forced open by the pressure, and the building was flooded.

Nevertheless, the scavengers go in to see what they can find. Though much of the place was ruined by unintended immersion, many of the devices appear to be salvageable, and some of the Twilights set to work, doing the best they can to adapt the parts they find to the machinery they've already constructed. Davron does not join in; instead, he swims deeper into the building, and finds a doorway with warning signs carved into its surface. His heart lifts; amongst the glyphs is the word "Essence" - and the doorway is _glowing_. Barely able to breathe, he touches the glyph of opening beside the door... and it swishes open, revealing a small chamber beyond.

Davron swims inside, and the door shuts behind him. Here, he pauses, carefully studying the writing on the walls inside, and with growing elation, he realizes that the chamber is an airlock. The facility beyond must have been crucial enough to protect against the outer halls being flooded. Hurriedly leaving again, he fetches several of the other Solars, and, all crowding inside the airlock, they press the rune to open the inner door. Nothing happens for a moment... and then there is whine of old machinery, and a rush of bubbles. It takes several minutes - clearly the pumping mechanism needs some work - but finally the chamber is dry, and the seaweed falls away as the inner door opens.

And the Twilights breathe a sigh of relief. This is indeed the power station, as the signs outside had suggested. The power demands of a factory-cathedral can often outstrip the output of the city's Manses, especially when the latter are required to power the domes and tramcars and walkways of the city proper; and this one is still working. The lights flicker occasionally, but the thrum of Essence engines can be heard in the still air.

There is almost a race to the monitoring station, where the Descending Suns find what they had hoped for: the power output is enough. Well, almost enough, but some repair should put it over the line. The city will barely be able to hover above the waves, and the factory-cathedral itself will be useless until other energy sources can be found - but these ancient engines will provide the additional Essence they need to raise the city from the depths.

Some of the Twilights stay behind, repairing the old equipment, while the others - including Davron and Ramar - return to the airlock, Ramar invoking the Viridian Mantle anew before Davron presses the outer opening glyph. The door opens a crack, to let the water in, before opening fully, and the occupants rush to tell the others, to get the engines completed. Nearby the power station is a rack holding small, fist-sized gems that now glow faintly; shaped like Hearthstones, they are obviously meant to channel the factory's power to remote equipment. Just the thing for the engines.

Several back-breaking hours later, the last engine is in place on the edge of the city, and the workers are stationed around them. The Ragaran sorceress that had once tried to kill Egress now shapes a more peaceful spell - Written Upon the Water - to send a message to the operators in the power station. The spell can only send a handful of words, but she only needs three: "Turn it on."

Far above the sunken city, the waters grow still. Eerily so. The currents that have caused waves to cascade over each other now become entangled, mired in the grasp of Essence as it is channeled through then arcane engines and along the City's chosen course. The ground shakes and stirs as the long-sunken city awakens. Dirt and other refuse is disturbed from its ancient resting place, scattered by the new activity that flows through the city.

All around the city, in the wake of the now-active engines, the clouds of dust take on shapes of mandalas and ancient sigils that spread out across the ocean floor. The City rises. Rocks, fish, creatures whose names have been forgotten to time tumble to the ground, their stories unknown and untold as the city lifts from the ocean's floor. All around a curtain of bubbles heralds the city, water changing to air as the elemental alignment of the engines shift. Soon, the city shall taste the sky once more.

The ascent is relatively slow, and incredibly massive. Within the first few minutes of the activation, the waters near the surface, once mired, now begin to move with purpose. Waves chop back and forth, parting as clouds for the rays of the sun. Beneath these waves, the long-lost city nears its destination. There is a great quaking of the sea... and somewhere, far removed from Creation, in an office of Yu-Shan, a functionary takes the first glance at the paperwork being filed on its desk. There is something between a scream and a sigh as it resigns itself to the lengthy task of resurfacing a city. With half-muttered oaths, it begins to write.

Meanwhile, in Creation, the waters now begin to bubble as the cities engines rapidly heat and cool everything in its wake. Any ships nearby have since vacated, and it is fortunate, for the amount of water displaced when the first of the city's towers crests over the waves-let alone the outpouring of once-flooded chambers creates waves that would put any Celestial Sorcerer's Torrential Cascade to utter shame... then there's the sound of ten thousand rainstorms, flooding the sea... and just as suddenly as it occured... now the seas begin to calm. The city has breached the surface.

Elementally aligned Essence provides a barrier between the city and the sea, keeping it aloft. The hum of Essence driven engines is an odd yet calming sound, and the air is crisp... alive, real... charged with Essence. There is a moment between lightning and thunder here, and when the last of the water is pumped from within the city's depths... it is truly finished. A city long lost, now found. There can be no doubt now that these Solars can accomplish what none have before. With this act, this gesture, a new hope for the future is born.

Now that the ancient city lies above the waves once more, Egress can finally visit the capital of the Deliberative. She does not ride, but walks along beside Jin-nu. Their voices do not shatter the calm here, but instead another richer sound rises as Egress plays the Ophicleide of Jyamis, that wonderful gift received in what seems another lifetime. Her song mingles with the whistling wind, and the motions of the sea. In time, Egress ceases her first song, raising her voice now to praise Azel and to consecrate the restored city in the name of the Unconquered Sun, whose Chosen have returned it to the light of day once more.
