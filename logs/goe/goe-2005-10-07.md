# Gods of Eden 2005-10-07

Hours later, the sun is beginning to set on the risen city, the streets still covered in algae and seaweed and the other denizens of the deep. Far obove the city, a tiny dot of alabaster is circling downward, seeking a cluster of Exalts standing outside one of the buildings.

As the dot grows closer, details become clear, and Ramar in a volo makes a landing. A few quick directions are made, and the Dragon-Blooded and Solar engineers spread out. Minutes later, the city rolls slightly, and then begins to trundle slowly along the waves. It is almost sundown by the time a small uninhabited island appears on the horizon. The shadow of the city falls over the island, followed shortly by the city itself, a low rumbling audible for miles around the landing site.

Davron breathes a sigh of relief as he feels the city stabilize. There had been a few tense moments, largely unnoticed by anyone who hadn't actually been piloting the city, where he wasn't sure if the old power connections would hold. But now the city is safe, for now. Now he and his fellow Twilights can get back to work on the Essence-windmills they had been building to power the city. With those, and with several other Essence sources still on the drawing boards, the city can truly fly, rather than merely lurching along the sea, one misstep away from returning to Azel's embrace.

There are certain rites that should be performed when doing something so serious as landing a city on an island. Egress offers a prayer to the god of the island, the prayer coming as a song, first with the rising of her voice, and then with the instrument of Jyamis, the two flowing into each other so smoothly only a trained ear could tell when Egress' singing begins or ends. But it takes in far more, for even the crashing of the waves and the restless rush of the winds is drawn into the offering, and soon it is a chorus of pure music that is turned to the island, and Egress lets her caste mark burst into light as she draws upon essence, a sign of greeting to the god whose island the Solars wish to use.

Chi-Yosh has given Davron a wide berth, despite questions and concerns. Instead he focuses the energy into exploring the city and getting a catalog of what has survived. First he speaks to the divers who had been exploring the city prior to the Solars' overriding the operation. Then it's coordinated sweeps of the city, block by block, to recover First Age artifacts, priceless art, and ensure no shades of those lost in the city haunted their watery grave.

When nigt falls and the shadows grow darker, shades begin to stir. The city's recent disturbance has been felt by the hungry dead whose shades could not leave their watery home. Now at last, the cool evening breeze runs through the streets, stars shine brightly above, and all of these things grate on their existence. They represent all that had been lost, forgotten, when the city fell so long ago.

There is also the breath of the living. Their warmth calls to these wretched spirits, as a siren calls to travellers at sea. These living, however, are no mere mortals. The shades of so long ago find bitter illumination at the hands of their foes. Dragon-blooded and Solar alike. Animas light the night sky, banishing shadow and at last bringing peaceful respite to those poor twisted souls. When the dawn comes, it is a far more peaceful dawn than this city has seen in ages.

At last there is time for rest - a precious commodity in the Age of Sorrows. But not much rest. By midday, the restless minds and hands of Exalted craftsmen are back at work, inspecting the lifting engines for damage. One of them has failed completely, a hole melted right through the steel wall - but if anything, this discovery is the most valuable, as it reveals a design flaw that will have to be mended in its more fortunate siblings before the city can be lifted above the clouds.

In any case, the ruined engine is a useful source of spares for the rest - for it may be necessary to move the city again, and a wise savant is always prepared. Then it's back to the old factory-cathedral, to search the place top to bottom for useful equipment. There isn't much, and a lot of what is there is required to service the ancient power plant, which is showing its own signs of wear from its recent exertion, but some small but vital baubles are secured for other aspects of the sky-city project.

Davron coughs, as he and two Dragon-Bloods walk down the corridor they'd swum down not so long ago. Indoors, the sun has not had a chance to dry things out, and the corridor walls are stained with clinging green algae. Their footfalls splash down the corridor, occasionally squelching. "Careful - there's a thick patch here, I almost slipped on it." The others take care to avoid the slippery clump of seaweed, already starting to rot. There is no time to clean up just yet - that will be the work of weeks or months. "There should be a storeroom down this way," says one of the Ragarans, reading the overgrown First Age calligraphy etched on the ceiling near a junction.

Davron nods. "Here. Hang on, this door looks watertight..." he says, touching an opening panel, and then grasping the doorframe for dear life as a fresh torrent of icy seawater gushes from the ancient hold. It takes several seconds for the room to drain, and Davron wipes a strand of seaweed from his face as the water subsides. "Drat. Well, _something_ in there must be waterproof. Let's have a look."

And so it goes for hours, as the search parties scour the dank, dripping hallways and concourses. Every so often, a team has to hold onto the walls to brace themselves against a flash flood unleashed by someone else deep in the complex, and frequently huge drifts of seaweed must be hacked away or encrusted sealife pried loose before the valuables beneath can be obtained - or more often nothing of use at all. But still they persevere.

The city is similar to Denandsor, but less so - the Shogunate's echo of the First Age's splendor is itself still a brilliant light. Wonders of jade are integrated into the buildings and streets, and once provided heat and illumination and protection to the residents. Most of these things will need significant repairs. Other things are found as well. A treasure-trove of household artifacts and personal miracles that would fetch a handsome price for any Scavenger Lord, but in greater quantity than all but the best dare to dream of.

What once might have been libraries and studies are virtually useless, since no paper would survive. The hardier records are engraved on plates or come in the form of murals, and so at least something like an artistic tradition remains intact.

Some of the more interesting finds are a warehouse filled with water-proof casks of 'monkey-wine'; an armory containing ammunition and power supplies for assorted Shogunate Essence-weapons; a golem workshop that was sealed from the water; and a series of animated crystal sculptures that can speak and have a limited range of movement, which seem to act as the historical record for the city's rulers.

On the second Day, Chi-Yosh takes the volo and flies far westward. He would have had to take a day and a half out of the Circle's time but the sight of smoke draws the Solar's attention to a burning Guild vessel and a triumphant ship flying the colors of two familiar Dragon-Blooded pirates.

Amid suspicion and awe, the Solar lands aboard the ship. The crew is familiar with his story, having helped deliver the watery haven to the pirate's people. Aboard the ship he meets Eos, apart from his companion for the voyage. "I come to you from the Goddess of the Deep Lost," says Chi-Yosh to the rake. "I stand by Azel's banner now. She is impressed with the amount of wealth you send into her domain. She asks that the next fifteen boats you burn, that you burn them in her name, and send a prayer her way."

The former Realm pirate rubs his chin in consideration. "So you say that one of the powerful goddesses of the sea, she that rules over sunken vessels, has taken notice of us and has asked us personally to pay homage to her? I do not like to trifle in the affairs of the Gods, but men at sea need all the love the depths provide. I shall send the ships to the depths for her, so that my fleet may not meet the same fate anytime soon."

With the floating city safely settled, and the requirements of Azel met, Egress can focus her mind back to the east, and to the needs of her fellow Solars. She gathers her circle and the Dragon-blooded together. There is no preamble to her proposal. There is simply a need to be met.

"The time for action has come," says Egress. "The Bull of the North stirs, and it is our duty to see he crushes the forces of darkness and the Wylds. There is honor for all who will face these enemies of Creation, and in their destruction is hope for yet another strong place, a bulwark against the coming madness." She looks to her friends and to her new followers, "Not everyone is meant for war, but there will be a great need for all our talents in this coming war. We must do all we can to make our victories swift and decisive. Time is working against us."

"We will first go to the Nation of the Sun, and gather still more of our allies. Word is already being sent there, and also to Greyfalls. The time for wavering and foot-dragging is gone. The time for battle and victory at any price is here." Egress looks to her circle and smiles, "We will not abandon our friends, who have proven true time and time again. It is time to even the score."

By the time the airship is flying back to Bridal Veil, Egress has been joined by Rain of Fire, the great dragon flying along with the ship and assuring Egress that all has been prepared as she requested. The Dragon Princes have been gathered to hear her words, and the people of Greyfalls have agreed to speak with her, as well. As soon as the ship lands, Egress is given a full update on the condition of the Nation, handling concerns smoothly and making what decisions are required of her swiftly. The more serious concern lies ahead. Lightning must strike from her again. The Dragon Princes await. And even after that, the days duties will have just begun.

Again Egress speaks, but this time it is to those who know her, who have had time to grasp the power that the Solars hold, and have seen first hand what Solar leaders do for their people. In a very short time, a place hopelessly divided and locked in almost meaningless skirmishes over patches of land that no side could hope to hold has been turned into a strong nation. The people live more safely, their laws are fair, their hopes are high. Their lives have been enriched by the work of doctors, artisans, teachers, and shamans. The gods are given the honor due their positions, and the dead are peacefully sent on to be reborn again. The heroism of the Solars here is not just a matter of moving words, but of undeniable fact.

The results are more subtle than the last speech the Zenith gave, but they are also more deeply rooted, for they draw upon a loyalty and love that was ready to burst through on its own. The centuries do many things, but the very nature of the Dragon-Blooded is to serve at the side of the Masters of Creation, and it is now time for that loyalty to come to the fore again. The Light of the Sun flows through the Dragon Princes like fire through a dry field. The Bull of the North shall be given aid. Perhaps far more than he imagined.

Egress departs the chamber to the booming of applause. Immediately she is joined by Dace. Egress smiles and nods to him, answering before he asks, "Of course I wish you to be at my side, General. You will be leading a different kind of army, I think, but you will find them much to your liking. I trust you will not mind having loyal Dragon-Bloods in your ranks." And already she is thinking of Greyfalls, but she has still more to consider. She wants an update on the work in Rathess. Which she hopes to gain on her way to Greyfalls. "I will be going to Greyfalls now. I trust you to prepare things here for our departure. If the Dragon Princes have a need, open the armory to them. The 'gifts' of the Mask of Winters should rightly be used against the Deathlords."

The report Egress receives is quite good, though she imagines the Rathess mission would be doing better if only she has more resources to offer them. She sends an assurance to those in Rathess that once Yurgen's battles are won, she will come herself. That decision does not please Dace a great deal. There seems a change in the man. He's grown. He knows that Egress is far from helpless, but he cannot forget what happened to Gallius, and he has an impulse to be rather protective of the Heirophant. Still, she will not be gainsaid.

There is no fight between the two, of course. Never in front of others, and especially not before a battle. Egress simply accepts that she will need to bend her will to Dace in some way in the future to make up for this. At least he does not ask to join her on the mission, but she knows she'll wind up being given a lot of armed support when the time comes. Still, that time is not now. It is Greyfalls that is on her mind. Landing near the city, Egress comes her not as a lone traveller, but as both Queen of the Nation of the Sun and Heirophant of the Deliberative. She has not had a great deal of time to learn what the current mood of the city is, but she imagines she shall learn soon enough.

Egress makes a point of not coming alone. She makes a huge point of it, in fact. With her come several of the Dragon Blooded. House Ragara is given a place of honor, but the Dragon Princes are not ignored. All have earned their place, through faith and through deeds. Rain of Fire and Jin-nu are both with Egress, as is Dace, and any of the circle who wish to come here with the Heirophant on this most auspicious day.

Even as busy as he is, Davron doesn't want to miss the return to Greyfalls. He carries a thick notebook wherever he goes, and whenever he thinks no one's watching, he's scribbling busily in it, notes on energy flows and the inner fabric of clouds. But he is there with Egress, because this is an occasion that deserves the whole Circle's attendance.
