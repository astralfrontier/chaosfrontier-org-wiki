# Gods of Eden 2005-10-14

In this brief time of 'rest', the Heirophant decides she must hone her skills. She has seen the power of her leadership even among the Dragon-blooded and wishes to expand upon it. For several days she focuses upon these newer flows of essence, spending her time focusing on the image she desires to have, the way she wishes to be seen. She finds herself close to her ideal, and with still more focus, finds the perfect balance she needs to reach out and touch those across any distance with the stories of her faith and deeds, so that even the mention of her name may now bear a most powerful effect.

Chi-Yosh has had the Abyssals on his mind. How is Ra doing? Sun-and-Moon has developed just fine beneath Erisus's guidance, but what about the now-Solar, the first of his kind to return from redemption. Egress has made it a point to clense the sparks of their taint, but the Su'Katan has more of a laid-back interest. He wants to know the progress that has been made, and how they are holding up individually; it was he who had brought in Blood on Snow, and a personal respect of the man's mission has left the Solar wanting more to do with the mission at hand.

Egress hears of Chi-Yosh's interest, and thinks it is time her attention turn that direction again. Especially since the question may arise again-and soon-of what to do with captured Abyssals. The results of the current efforts are going to play a huge part in the strategies she suggests to Yurgen in the coming weeks.

---

Erisus has returned to his once-forgotten name with the arrival of the girl Sun-and-Moon. He has made another change, in leaving behind his crystal mansion out in the wilds of the East. With the turning of the year he now spends more and more time in the wild wastes south of the Yanaze River and east of Marita. It is here that he can be found, and it is here that Ra and Sun-and-Moon are receiving instruction from him.

While Ramar and Davron have their minds bent on other matters, Chi-Yosh leads - with Egress following, for Greyfalls is near. They find the ancient Lunar and his two charges underground through the aid of a minor elemental left behind for this purpose. Through a twisting network of caves they travel, down and down and down into the depths of the earth. The air is thick and suffocating, but torches light the way, demonstrating that they are indeed following a path. And at the end of that path is something new to both Solars.

It feels as though they have entered the Underworld again, and perhaps that grim and dismal place has touched the community here. They enter an enormous cavern in which equally gargantuan skeletons rest. It is these ivory relics that form the figurative skeleton for a town - no, a small city. There are no buildings; there are hide coverings strung between ribs. There are no streets; there are loose fossils delineating level stretches of black cavern floor.

If it is a city built on death, it is nevertheless a city where the living dwell in number. Egress and Chi-Yosh pass by townsfolk both alive and otherwise in their travel, before being greeted near the entrance by a young man. Like all those in this place, his skin is pale to the point of total whiteness, and his eyes are large and bulbous. He introduces himself as Khef, and offers to lead the pair to Erisus, his charges, and his host.

Chi-Yosh watches all that he passes with a level of unease. This is... something new and unexpected, to say the least of matters. It actually makes him worry that something has happened to those he has known and cared for in their own ways. Khef is bayed to lead the pair onwards, through the necropolis. "Something feels amiss here," murmurs the Dawn to Egress as they pass hides stretched across the conically-assembled bones of the buildings.

Egress frowns, disliking this place more with each passing moment. "It's a foul air," she whispers quietly. "What kind of person would ever want to live in a place like this? A place with no sun or moon." She shakes her head, fighting down a rising growl of distaste.

"Refugees from the underworld," Guesses Chi-Yosh. "We will see what Erisus has to say."

Through the streets the pair wander, guided by Khef. Here and there, other citizens can be seen. An ancient ghost, an old man with a bent back, sits atop a chair made of bone and hide, rocking quietly and smoking a pipe. A mother hangs out the wash on a limbs of a dead and stunted tree, while around her skirt her two boys run and play and shout and laugh. Two men - one living, one dead - sit in front of a skull and play Gateway on a carven teak board.

Finally the group arrives at a "house", or rather a stone dwelling that looks halfway to being a mausoleum. Khef opens the door and steps to one side, bowing in invitation for the Solars to pass inside.

Within is a long table, and at it sit Ra, Sun-and-Moon, and two strangers. Erisus paces the floor, speaking to all of them, and stops upon the entrance of the Circle. He looks up and studies them a moment, and the others turn to look as well in expectant silence.

Chi-Yosh allows the moment to stretch. Finally, he steps inside and bows to Erisus. Turning, the Dawn leans against the nearby wall, crossing his arms over his stomach in a relaxed pose. Though he takes a look at the strangers, his attention shifts to Egress, suspecting a challenge.

Egress looks to Chi-Yosh a moment, then back to Erisus. She arches an eyebrow at the Lunar, but says nothing. The Ikth-ya's expectation is clear enough. She wants to know where this is, and why she has been brought here.

"Welcome to Grave," Erisus says at last. "If you wish to listen and learn, then sit." He indicates the crude bench at which the other four already sit.

Chi-Yosh simply gives Egress a look: patience. Though it would be funny he asking that of a Zenith to have faith. The solar steps forward and settles into one of the seats without further preamble.

Egress is Zenith in some places and times. Among the Lunars, it seems more common for her to be Heirophant or Ikth-ya. The difference leads her to sit, eyes focused upon Erisus, giving the venerable Lunar the respect he deserves. And not a hair more.

".... As I was saying," the Lunar continues. As he speaks it's clear that he is reiterating at least some of what he has said before, for the benefit of his new audience. "The oral tradition here will be useful to you both. Some of the citizens here have memories stretching back to the Shogunate or before. While the Silver Pact retains similar lore, we simply were not in many parts of the world that these people were. Thus, you will receive a more balanced viewpoint by studying with them. You in particular, Ra, will be able to understand the perspective of the once-living."

Erisus hums, then gestures. "Perhaps we should all go meet the city's patron god. I think our guests deserve to know more, and it is time anyway."

The group at the table rises, and Erisus leads the way. Khef is long gone. In his place, the Lunar navigates the four Solars and two natives. They descend into deeper caverns whose tunnels are carved such that they join cleanly with the streets. Along the way, the Lunar falls back - his two local guests seem to know the way - to speak. "We are in the city of Grave, where the living and dead mingle," he explains in a whisper which nevertheless echoes from the cavern walls. "The stars of Creation and the stars of the Underworld both rule it, through some inexplicable principle. It is that same principle which led to many Behemoths coming here during the making of the world - they who dug through the master tunnels, then arrived here only to die when this place's strangeness counteracted their natural tendency to immortality. The skeletons you saw above are their legacy."

"Here neither the gods nor the Neverborn hold true sway. And so here is where a certain party has come to rule, for only here does he find peace from the curse which burdens his soul. He is the patron god of Grave, and his name is Blood on Snow." The Lunar stops speaking, for the group have entered some monumentally deep grotto. At the center of it is a throne of granite and obsidian, encrusted with jewels, and on it sits the Abyssal negotiator. Beside him his daughter stands, red eyes gleaming, fangs hinted at as she smiles at the new arrivals. Blood on Snow rises, and bows deeply.

Chi-Yosh catches the girl's eyes. He is reminded of his sin of hesitance in the fortress of the Dowager's knights, and it subdues him. The Patron God's bow is returned with a sad smile. "I am glad to see that you have found a place to fit, Blood on Snow."

Egress considers Erisus closely, letting out a soft sigh. She mutters under her breath as they are led, "Plots within plots with twists that would only delight a Sidereal." The Heirophant idly wonders just how the existance of this place shall fit into her plans for Creation. She is sure of one thing, at least: she has no love for this place. Still, some level of civility is required, and she bows to Blood on Snow, though not quite as deeply as she might in another place.

The Abyssal bows gently, then gestures. "Make yourselves at home," he says. And despite memories from before, the Solars receive no hint of compulsion, no hidden currents of forcible obedience. Whatever the curse/gift he bore before, it is not in operation now.

Chi-Yosh collects himself a seat, and regards the chamber solemnly. To be the patron god of such a place must be odd on the soul, but then so must be the presence of the deathknight spark. Whatever it has done, at least it is a place to be. For now he is resigned to be silent, and allow Erisus's pupils, or Egress for that matter, a place to learn and to speak.

Egress will study the daughter of the Abyssal, rather curious. Still, it matters little now. She rather wonders what this means still, hoping that something said here shall banish the darkness and displeasure that grows stronger in the Zenith with each passing moment. It is with more than a little doubt that she claims a seat.

"We are here to learn more of the living and the dead," Erisus announces to nobody in particular, but his words are intended in some fashion for all. For Egress and Chi-Yosh, it explains the presence of his two Solar pupils. To his charges, it represents a call to attention - more learning is on the way.

Blood on Snow nods solemnly, and smiles at Chi-Yosh in particular. "I was never able to say 'thank you' properly, nor to honor you," he says. "Allow me to do so here. And to you as well," this directed to Egress. "Yes, I have heard about you and .. and she. Yes, I have heard rumors from afar of great conquests. And I too have tried to find my place in this world."

Erisus clears his throat; what he has to say is meant mostly for his charges, as he begins speaking. "As the Chosen of the Sun, you are the lawgivers and truth-finders. You are the cleansers of darkness, the bringers of light. You are the arbiters of right and wrong. I have brought you here because the actions of the Celestial Exalted brought about the Underworld itself. Their choices - your very predecessors' choices - gave death to the world. You are responsible now not only to the living, but also to the dead. When you direct Creation, you are not directing pulses. You are directing souls. Remember that always, because the common criminal the law sentences to death may return as a hungry ghost and do greater harm than he ever did in life."

"In this place, you will see the living and the dead mingling. Is this right, or is it wrong? If you come into power, you will make that decision for yourselves and for the people you rule over. You have already seen Sijan, where the dead are laid quietly to rest as well as mortal men know how. You have seen the Nation of the Sun, where the dead do not rise because burial rights are observed stringently. You know of the Realm, wherein the dead are hunted. You know of the Silver Pact, where the dead form the army of our enemy. And now you will experience this place."

The Lunar teacher speaks more, telling something of the history of Grave; Blood on Snow and his daughter listen patiently, sometimes filling in details. The town has always been occupied, it seems, by a mixture of men and ghosts. Often the half-dead are born here - products of unions between the two. Such individuals fill the role of ministers, magistrates, and civil servants. And ruling over the city now, ever since his release from the Dowager's service, is the Abyssal himself. Erisus does not seem to fear the man, and the deathknight himself seems to be quite at ease.

At length the instruction ends, and Blood on Snow invites his guests to a banquet. "Locally-grown food and wine," he promises.

Chi-Yosh listens intently. He is not as perturbed with Grave's existance, or the place of Blood on Snow, as his companion. Easing from his seat, he follows the others to the feast, though has dubious expectations for foods of a place known for the dead. After collecting a plate, the Solar waits until conversation has taken a momentary lull. "Your voice is elequent," he says to the patron god, "Though I would have expected as much for a Speaker. How did you manage to remove your curse?"

"I did not," replies Blood on Snow. "It does not work in this place. The dark gifts of the Malfeans are suppressed here because of its peculiar nature. Nor can the Deathlords feel or find me here, unless they come just as you did."

Egress listens to those words of Blood on Snow, and hmms thoughtfully. "And what if they were brought here?" she wonders aloud. Her mind is focused as ever. If this place could help in the destruction of Deathlords...

"They themselves would not come. Their connection to the Neverborn would fail as they approached." The Abyssal continues as the group enters the banquet hall in his underground 'castle'. "Their servants, the Exalted like me, would come. Should that happen, we would evacuate through the tunnels. They would enslave the dead and slaughter the living. We have wards in place that are keyed to the Abyssal Exalted, and ward out the dead as well. They could break such things, but I would know of it."

"Can they be destroyed if that connection is broken?" asks Egress. "If they were pressed to come here, could they truly be defeated or imprisoned?" asks the Lioness. She imagines the threat of the rising Celestials will make it far less likely that the Deathlords shall have time to meddle with this city in between worlds.

"I do not know," admits the Abyssal. "So much about the Deathlords is cloaked in mystery."

"Perhaps something can be learned from this strangeness," says Egress. "But all things take study. Perhaps the Sidereals might use this place of mingled fates to learn something of those who stand outside fate." The Solar imagines that the Sidereals will inform her they've known about this place all along. It hardly improves the Heirophant's mood.

Chi-Yosh turns to Ra. "And, how goes you? How has your transition to a Solar gone, and treated you thus far, beneath the capable hands of Erisus?"

Ra smiles unsteadily. "He is a harsh teacher," he says, reverent fondness in his voice.

Those who are gathered for the banquet find their seats. In due time, the first course is carried out by half-clothed girls who bow, smile, and giggle a bit. Like all the rest, they are pale almost to the point of translucency.

Chi-Yosh opens his mouth to reply to Ra, and then recalls that Ra had sacrificed all of his memories. He could not answer how being a Solar feels, or is different for him, as he would not know. The Dawn simply nods.

Food is laid out - and it is rich, piping hot, and well-seasoned. The others begin to eat.

Egress remains quiet for most of the time, thinking and saying little. It's a positive trait she's picked-up only recently. She doesn't like this place in the least. Nor would any Solar, she thinks. There is living and death here, which is better than pure death. Is this truly recovery? Is there any healing here, or is this simply a way for a Deathknight to grow into a Deathlord in their own right?

Ra eats quietly and sparingly. Sun-and-Moon, for all her initial hostility and confusion at the time of her Exaltation, has been quiet. But she demonstrates a regal air, almost of command, in her every motion. Even when sampling the appetizers, she carries herself as a future queen. Erisus eats with speed and practicality. As for the others of the city of Grave at the table, Blood on Snow and his daughter included, there is little formality. The 'patron god' of the city is welcomed as simply another fellow at the dinner-table by those sitting around him, and even those who bring food are not servants or slaves. More like waitresses at a tea-house or restaurant. Nevertheless they continue their girlish titters, staring particularly at Chi-Yosh and Ra and whispering at each other.

Chi-Yosh offers smiles to the onlookers, pleased with a distraction from the forboding. He does not let the darkness of his surroudings errode at him. Even the darkness is a small one - there lacks the forlorn loss, or the dreading cold of the Underworld, the hunger and fear that the dead bring in many places. It is not a place of fear or sadness or pain. It does not make him like the dead any more, but it is a small comfort. The food he samples with interest, finding it very earthy - naturally.

At length one of the men who came with Erisus from the 'lodge' above leans over to explain. "The girls have never seen men whose faces look like leather," he explains, referring to the fact of skin color, for all who live here are virtual albinos. "They wonder how heavily you paint yourselves in the morning."

Chi-Yosh manages a chuckle at that. "Ah. But it is not makeup," He states, loud enough to be heard, "But the touch of the sun. Helios has not reached his fingers this deep in the earth. Before now." It is the job of the Solars to bring light to scatter the darkness. But why not to show those who have never seen the joy of the Unconquered Sun? Sunlight crests over him, shining from his skin in the warm, soft orange tinge of morning, casting long shadows in the chamber and bringing warmth across pale skin.

The girls shriek and recoil at the sudden display, while the men bring their hands to their overlarge eyes to shield them. Only Blood on Snow, once accustomed to the sight of the Sun and experienced in seeing that light's champions, does not wince or flinch.

The Zenith snickers at the reaction of the girls, letting out a sigh. She turns her attention to Erisus, and to the matters that she had been leaving quiet for perhaps too long. "So, has the Mistress of the Well remained silent, or does she stir?"

"We have heard little, which is good news," Erisus replies. "My spirit-allies and elemental friends have been allowed to roam freely near her domain, and have reported nothing amiss."

The sunshine dies following the realization that a lack of exposure to sunlight, even as faint as dawn's warm presence, can harm those who have never been touched by it. He rubs his brow, tiredly, and smiles weakly at Egress. "It seems Torch rises again."

Erisus laughs softly, as the others begin to recover. The serving-girls leave, but do not giggle further. Blood on Snow shows a quirky, lopsided smile. His daughter is grinning like a maniac at Chi-Yosh.

"She moves quietly then," murmurs Egress. "We will not know where she shall strike next until she decides to reveal it to us." That prospect is hardly pleasant. She shakes her head at Chi-Yosh, "If you wanted me to make them panic, you could have just asked. I rather doubt they would know what to do if I brought the brightest rays of the Unconquered Sun to this place."

"Our world is strange to you, and if you are uncomfortable, I apologize." This from Blood on Snow, whose voice is more serious now, and whose eyes stare straight at Egress. "This is who we are. That is who you are. If we do not meet your approval, then please understand that we do not ask for it. We wish only to exist in the way that feels right for us."

Egress meets those eyes evenly. "Many things we are change," she observes. "The world forces us to adapt or to be crushed under the wheels of history. Or if we are strong, to dictate what shall be and make it happen." There is little doubt that the Zenith has no interest in passively watching the world do as it will any longer.

"For now, let neither of us dictate," Blood on Snow murmurs. "Let us enjoy our food." He smiles, invitingly, a silent request for Egress to join in the spirit of the gathering.

Egress is a woman of many talents. Not the least of which is performing to expectation, and so she can manage to at least hide her distraction far better than any mortal ever has. She imagines there is some use to be made of this place and a whole new level of doubt to contend with. How many more pockets of 'in between' are there burrowed into the bowels of Creation? How many Abyssals might be using them not to go on living as they wish, but to gather power?

In due course the food is finished, and Erisus suggests that Ra and Sun-and-Moon accompany the Circle for a short time - "a learning experience", as he puts it. In return, he offers to provide magical transportation to wherever the pair intended to go next.

With assent given, he leads the way himself back up through the tunnels, with his students and the Solars in tow. At length they come to a large, but wholly natural, grotto, in which a small lake or large pool of underground water rests. The Lunar performs a short calling ceremony, and in the water a face shapes itself. He treats with this spirit in Old Realm, bartering a favor, and at length informs the others that they may enter the pool and the god will transport them anywhere in Creation where natural water rests. And so the Circle departs...
