# Gods of Eden 2005-11-04

Paper surrounds Davron on all sides - on the desk, in heaps on the floor, on spare chairs. An extravagance of paper, such as only one of his station could afford to use on working notes. Right now, his finger is tapping on just one sheet of paper, and on one number on that sheet of paper. That number is the number of pounds of orichalcum needed to make the great city's full flight engines, as well as all the armaments it will need to defend itself against the enemies this Circle must make. And the number is too high. Davron snatches up the sheet and stalks out of the room to gather the Circle together. The time has come for the Deliberative to reclaim another piece of its heritage: an orichalcum mine.

"The Realm guards all the known orichalcum deposits, against the return of the Anathema," says Davron. "And their locations are state secrets. But..." Davron looks away toward the east, and grins. "Correct me if I'm wrong, Egress, but do we not have an ally in the East? A leader of a city, who might be privy to such secrets?"

"Perhaps she doesn't know that it is orichalcum they guard," Davron admits, "but she would have some knowledge of troop movements. Supply lines. Things of that sort." Davron grins at Ramar. "And if she can supply the records, then surely we can find some way to read between the lines?"

"I do not know what secrets she might keep," answers Egress. "Nor do I know that she is ready yet to reveal them." The Heirophant sighs softly and nods at some unspoken thought, "I will remind her that we are still here, and that her city is protected by the power of our Nation. She will see that the best way to maintain her people's safety is to aid us. To make us more capable." It's rather clear, though, that something else is in the back of the Lioness' mind.

Davron nods. "There are other things we may do, though. There are legends of orichalcum mines, are there not? Or else how would we imagine that they existed? The earth does move, but it does not move _that_ quickly. Old stories may serve almost as well as new ones to guide our search." He rubs his hands together. "It's been far too long since I've combed through our libraries..."

---

"We shall need the aid of the people." That is what Egress understands very well. It is what she is best at. Her powers have grown and changed. Now she does not need to fly to all corners of the land to speak. Instead, the very essence of her charisma flows out from her like water from a spring. One speech spreads like wildfire through the land, and men and woman of skill respond. There shall be many hands to do the work required to repair and work the mines by the time they are found.

And many minds are needed to find them. The call is not just for strong hands and skills in the mine, but also knowledge of old stories, the tales of the wise that faded over time until the last vestiges of the ancient lore was passed down only in the form of careless stories told to children. They come as tales of wondrous things, and lessons of virtue. It is through these webs that the wisest Solars must reach for the truth.

The minds of the people are swayed, and called to task. Ramar's mind is put to the task of organizing this great mission. Where Egress' words have turned the hearts of men to the cause, it is Ramar who directs them, channels the newfound energy. Thousands upon thousands of individuals become coherent groups, who all answer to people who in turn answer to Ramar. Thus, the directing of the task is accomplished. Yet there is more to be done. It is an easy thing to have a supervisor, much less so to be one. Ramar must attend to the matter of transporting and coordinating the various movements, including those of the Nation's Soldiers.

It is done, however, with Ramar himself directing the flow of traffic. Roads are mapped out, and appeasements made to the spirits who watch over them as the men and women of the Nation travel upon them. And it's done so... subtly as well. There are no massive marches of people, no odd pilgrimages. Merely Ramar's hand behind the scenes, arranging for caravans to be diverted, or for a pilgrimage to leave a few days early or late, with more than they set out. It is not an easy task, though, and he is thankful for Marina's help in some of the more subtler areas. Even if it does mean she has to put up with him.

There are things to consider when going to Greyfalls. It weighs on Egress' mind quite often, that city that is couched in her nation. She has often considered trying to draw it into the Nation, but was never certain enough that the time was ripe for it. She has more than her own guidance in this now, however. With the assistance of the Priestess, the very patterns of the stars may be a guide. She goes to her advisor and asks of her, "Is this the proper time to draw Greyfalls into the Nation? Does fate smile upon such an act, or will it cause harm to the people of that city, whom I care for even as my own."

The once-haughty woman, who now dresses in simple white robes of spun silk and rolls her lovely hair into a severe bun when she appears at all, inclines her head respectfully. "I anticipated your question. You test your fate against a fiercely independent people. Your own independence will be the key to victory. You too stand outside the rules that dominated Creation for so long. Carry that aspect with you to the Cathak woman who holds influence in the city."

---

This occasion is not one of huge fanfare. As with many things, Egress rather prefers to let the sun start cloaked, so that when its glory is fully revealed the splendor is that much the greater. Thus it is only the circle that comes to Greyfalls. The prowess of the Solars speaks more loudly than any following of guards or attendants, and when visiting a friend, weapons are only brought as a sign of respect and of station.

The circle is greeted in the customary way. They are brought to Alcis by the twins Naro and Kano, mortal enemies now serving as hosts. While some rough edges remain, the charisma and deeds of the solars have worn most of them away, so that respect and even friendship can be found here. This far from the Realm, the lies and half-truths of the Immaculate Philosophy far weaker than they were on the Blessed Isle itself.

"You have all been busy.... very busy." Alcis frowns as tea is brought out. "I hardly know what to think anymore. We don't know what to expect from the Nation, and rumors abound." The plain woman gives a sudden, lopsided grin then. "It'll be interesting to be swept along with the current, for you are not here on a social call, are you." And her eyes rove from Solar to Solar, meeting gazes, unafraid.

"If you don't know what to expect from the Nation, then we have been out of touch for far too long," says Davron, with a slight note of apology in his voice. "For today, though, we have a very specific errand in mind: we are seeking orichalcum mines."

"Mines, hmm? For the forbidden gold that you devils like..." Alcis' mouth quirks in a smile. She is enjoying some sort of joke, though there is no malice to it. "The shikari of the Wyld Hunt are sometimes punished, as I recall, by being ordered to stand guard over such places, and those who truly fail at even such a task are outcaste. Greyfalls is a city full of the outcastes of the Realm..." Her implication is clear - somebody in the city has specific knowledge the Circle seeks. "But even the Immaculate Order fears your god enough to not order that the mines be buried over or tampered with."

"There are men of the Rizai Sect of the Immaculate Faith who live here. I'm friends with their abbot. I'll arrange a meeting." And - of all things - she bows, as though she were somehow less of the military commander of a foreign city.

---

Bundled in winter furs, for after Calibration the world becomes chillier, Alcis and the others walk through the forbidding stone canyons of Greyfalls' streets. The Dragon-Blooded disdains the use of horses or rickshaws for transportation even in her own city, claiming a love of exercise. This sentiment seems to be shared by the men of the Rizai Cloister, for the group arrives in time to witness five monks practicing their katas in the open courtyard. Their breaths emerge as clouds in perfect rhythm as they move, and only when they are done does Alcis speak with their chief.

The Rizai Sect are semi-heretical: they believe that if the Anathema are like demons, that like any other demon a determined and persistent sorcerer could learn to bind one to service. Accordingly they hunt but do not kill when assigned to the Wyld Hunt, but even so they remain wary when Alcis introduces the Circle. The abbot, Bruess, wipes sweat from his brow with a towel around his neck, and clasps a fist in his open hand in the gesture of peaceful welcome. The meeting will be friendly.

Several minutes later, as the few laymen of his small temple bring the weary monks tea and serve their visitors honey-sweetened wine, Bruess has completed the major parts of his tale. He has told of the "god's gold", how the Great Houses guarded it as part of their dedication to the Wyld Hunt, and how in the highlands far northwest of Greyfalls the mines lay untouched still.

Of troop disposition he can give little beyond general advice, and of any remaining Exalted who guard the site he can say nothing at all - "men come and go", he observes.

If the abbot speaks true, the Circle realizes that their present force - augmented by Solar power - can certainly overwhelm the soldiers found there. The situation is far more favorable if one considers the chances that the Great Houses have withdrawn most of their troop strength to prepare for potential civil war.

"I have only one condition," Bruess adds at the end of his explanation. "If Alcis respects you, then you are people of honor. I believe you will honor my geas even after hearing my tale. I require that you notify the soldiers, if any remain, before attacking."

Chi-Yosh is surprised by the request. But as it sinks in, he merely inclines his head to the Abbot, providing a reassuring smile. "For you, we shall give them fair warning, good sir." With that, he bows politely.

Inaction. It seems that the Realm has moved all of its older soldiers into the mine. It hadn't always been so; when the Anathema had first started to resurface, security had been tightened in the mines. But in the last year, new management, feeling rather secure after not a single serious threat has occured since the Realm's seizure of the mines, had began to breathe a collective sigh of relief. It's not a practice in all, but a few have become a form of early retirement in leisure while collecting a little jade, or a place where lazy soldiers from well-to-do families are sent.

So it is a rude awakening for the two Realmsmen playing bones when a scout, barely composed from his run, strolls into their outpost. They rise up, feeling something is up. "Greetings. I come from the approaching army coming this way, flying the colors of the Nation of the Sun. Our queen requests you prepare yourselves." It's almost through a dream that the pair stumble to large horns and blow mightily, sending the low, echoing song to echo over the cliffside. And it is with great haste that they take to donning their armor.

Chi-Yosh is at the fore of the platoon that arrives first, hitting the expediously gathered line of defenders like a maul between the eyes. In moments the slam of two sides goes from a defensive line repelling the first wave to an all-out war - archers, perched on the cliffside above begin sending hailstorms of arrows beyond to the second wave of men, while reinforcements dredge up from the mine itself, workers with their pitchforks and shovels to defend their livelihood from demons. While they may be the lazy and grizzled, the Realmsmen are Immaculate trained, and valiantly press the Nation of the Sun's offensive, but as a winged automation overhead streaks past, picking away the bowmen at the cliff-face, the aggressors' second and third wave arrive, moving in to flank.

It is then that a Solar-lead push spears through the bulk of the defensive like, and clearing a path, surges forwards. The driving force then turn and, through the expert demands of a snarling Lioness on the horseback of an orichalcum steed, the Realsmen are surrounded and hewn away like a boulder beneath a sandstorm. Yet still they fight on, and the tides roll back and forth, then start to draw away, the fields red with blood, the soldiers flying Realm colors battered and broken, their numbers a sixth. Then the fighting secedes, the oppression taking a step back at the order from their foul leader, who offers the tainted promise of life and salvation in exchange for surrender.

The dust has settled from the battle before. Though now it is given new cause to be disturbed. The force of workers from the Nation have arrived, to provide support to the military's newest conquest. Now that the mine rests in the hands of the Circle, it is up to them to see to it that it is put to proper use. Ramar helps to oversee the lines of communication, ensuring that word passes from person to person, that the right hand knows what the left hand is doing. He takes inventory of the equipment, and makes certain that the safety of the workers remains the highest priority. Now that the gift of the Unconquered Sun is theirs once again, their heritage closer and closer to being fully realized... there's a tension of a kind... of one waiting for the other shoe to drop...

Meanwhile, as the Nation's miners prepare to embark upon their labors, Davron prepares the way for them. The equipment is still there and still somewhat functional, but the mine has lain fallow for centuries - the Dragon-Blooded may not have wrecked the old equipment, but their fearful respect for the Unconquered Sun did not extend to more than the most cursory of maintenance. The old lifts are not prepared to carry thousands of workers a day, the rusted mine-cart rails would shatter the weight hundreds of tons of ore and tailings. And it would take weeks for mortal artisans to get the old equipment running at full capacity again.

Davron is no mortal artisan. Creaking, crumbling pit props become whole, fit to bear the weight of a mile of rock once more, at a mere touch of Davron's hand; a cracked and rusted rail is set right with a single blow of his hammer. As he travels through the mines, his blazing anima providing all the light he needs to work by, he hauls two hand-carts, one filled with coal and steel and the other bearing a small forge; thus, when even the gifts of Helios cannot salvage a heap of crumbling rust, Davron casts the wreckage into the forge and rebuilds it from scratch. And when the supply of new metal runs out, rather than travel all the way to the surface again for fresh materials, Davron even bears a pickax, digging the materials he needs from the living rock itself.

The living rock is no mere observer in these endeavors. The Earth Dragon whose power lurks so near the surface of any mine, and whose anger is the terror and death of many a miner, can be placated with rites that even the Terrestrials are incapable of evoking. The secret names of earth and stone, the ancient and hallowed traditions of exacting the Celestial Deliberative's tax from the ground itself, are somewhat known. And they are practiced fully.

The mortal miners may have lived longer among the sun-gods than many people in this latter Age, but even they are fearful of following too close behind Davron when he uses his power to the utmost like this. But Ramar and Egress are there to hearten them, exhort them to be unafraid - to tend to the human elements of the mining operation as Davron repairs what is mechanical. And thus, when Davron finally climbs to the surface, exhausted, the mine is already well on its way to full operation - far sooner than anyone could have imagined, had they never witnessed what the Chosen of Sol Invictus can do.
