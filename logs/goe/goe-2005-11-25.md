Egress waits for the others near a fire that is almost failing. The wind whips her hair out, but it is not cold. Few things can truly bring a chill to the heat that surrounds Rain of Fire. The Zenith considers her role in her head again and again. The battle is simple enough to understand. That doesn't change all the unknown factors that shall bar the way. Waiting is maddening to her, of course, but there is, for the moment, little else to be done.

Snow crunches beneath the weight of the volo. The wings curl at rest, ice crystals jingling among the feathers. Chi-Yosh steps onto the chilly earth, stretching his aching legs while removing the goggles and cap that Ramar assured he'd need flying into the North. Egress is not hard to find, her mount like a navigation star in the sky.

Davron's golden boots crunch in the snow as he lands beside Chi-Yosh. "We came as soon as we could," he says, feeling the cold despite the thick furs worn beneath his armor but just as determined not to show it. "You realize that this will set back the Ranapura schedule, of course," he adds with a grin.

"It doesn't matter," says Egress simply. "As long as the deadlines are still met, of course." She looks at Davron with a grin. Deadlines meaning to get it done when it gets done, and preferably before its not being done gets everyone killed. "We have a promise to keep, in any case. The North must be brought around. It will put a satisfying pressure upon the Realm and take a great deal of strain away once these issues are settled in a lasting fashion."

Davron nods, looking away over Yurgen's encampment, in the direction where the Bishop's forces lie. "Indeed. Right now it's _those_ dead lines that concern us more."

Chi-Yosh's eyes follow Davron's, though his concerns fall more upon the fae they are to assist. While a promise of the Fair Folk can never be taken back, investing trust in them is an action of foolhardiness.

Yurgen Kaneko has decided to take on the opponents of the city of Whitewall - the Fair Folk and the dead. The Syndics who rule Whitewall have held an uneasy truce with these two forces for generations; a truce that would be uprooted if Yurgen has his way. His objective is to sweep through the northern half of the Threshold, taking possession of every significant shipping port north of the cold ocean that separates the region in half. With Whitewall in his pocket, the wily Solar will own the North.

In this end, the Circle of the Nation of the Sun have come to offer aid. Through their influence, the fey ruler of the dream-eaters known as the White Queen has promised her aid in destroying the necro-weapon the Bishop of the Chalcedony Thurible wields. An undead Behemoth will fall before the battle can be called a victory, and the Circle is here to ensure that the brilliant and beautiful and deadly warriors of the Fair Folk can achieve their end.

"Now it begins!" shouts Yurgen to the snowy heavens, as he rides atop a majestic mammoth whose tusks have been capped with spiky golden sheaths. Around him the thousands of barbarian soldiers whose chieftains owe fealty to him let out their battle-cries. Ten-score languages are spoken by the tribes here, but the only command they need is spoken in the bittersweet song of bloodlust.

The site of this first battle is a valley in which the Ghastly rests and is tended to. It is surrounded by the Bishop's grandest and most disquieting creations, for the Deathlord is no fool. Now, as the barbarians draw their myriad weapons and charge westward down the slope, the denizens of the shadowlands prepare to meet them.

Davron takes to the air as the battle-lines meet, and flies back and forth across the lines, his anima rippling across his gleaming bronze skin. His mission is to lend air support where it is needed - whenever a mass of undead soldiers threaten to break the barbarian battle-lines, he will halt his advance. But as he seeks out targets of opportunity, a horrific screech reminds Davron that the Bishop has air support of his own - a gigantic undead flying creature, almost as big as a roc, with six great wings beating the air as it swoops toward him. Davron circles around the thing to flank it, to draw it back over the undead troops as he harries it with arrows, sending bone splinters flying as his arrows smash at its wings.

"Hah! Take that!" calls Davron, eventually, as a final arrow crushes the vital support struts of the monstrosity's third left wing. Unbalanced, the enormous skeletal bird's three right wings flap madly, but the skin stretched over its bones only succeeds in putting the thing into an uncontrollable spin as it plummets back toward the frozen earth, crashing into a column of zombie-centaurs with a great spray of bone fragments and rotting flesh.

As the thing spirals to its doom, Davron's craftsman-soul is momentarily entranced by the thing's design - the great wing bones look like they'd been taken from a yeddim and hollowed out, rather than coming from any kind of bird at all, for example. Truly a work of art and craft, and Davron feels a brief but unsettling pang of kinship with the necro-surgeon - possibly even a Daybreak mirror-image of himself - that had conceived this unnaturally animated war machine of the air.

But there is little time for such consideration, as the flurry of wings of a flock of zombie-shrikes bears down on Davron, shedding frayed feathers as it descends upon him - dozens, scores of tiny birds of prey, each individual no more than a nuisance to even a mortal, but the flock as a whole a deadly hook-billed menace.

A menace - but not to an experienced Exalt. The wings of Davron's volo creak as he accelerates right _through_ the reanimated birds, and even as they spiral in confusion, Davron's anima bursts to life and his hand becomes a blur between bow and quiver. Arrows fly into the cloud of feathers like a swarm of angry hornets, sending about half of their number plummeting from the sky, each one neatly impaled on a wooden shaft.

There is a ghostly cry from within the flock, then - and Davron's second sight has a glimpse of something _else_ amongst the remaining birds as they reorganize themselves for a second attack. _A nemissary!_ thinks Davron, as the reason for the uncanny coordination of the flight of zombies becomes clear. Again, Davron admires the undead phantasm's virtuosity in manipulating the bodies of a hundred forms at once - but its virtuosity is in vain, as Davron draws his own Solar Essence across the bow and fires it at the heart of the puppeteer-ghost itself.

The nemissary shrieks with the chilling, piercing cries of all the remaining birds at once - and then its scream is cut off as a second Solar Spike puts an end to its unlife. The remaining shrikes flutter aimlessly, and Davron reorients himself - and finds, to his dismay, that although the flying zombies were not a danger to him, they were an effective distraction. The zombie-centaurs have marched on past him, and are now threatening Yurgen's barbarian hordes, their hooves speeding them across the field while their human upper halves wield sword and spear and bow. Shaking his head, Davron flies back across the field, weaving and dodging the arrows that fly up in his wake, and returns to the task of harassing the undead ground forces.

The Fair Folk host have not been tardy; if they did not attack at the same time as the barbarian hordes, it is perhaps because they do not hear the song of bloodlust. They instead sing it, marching forward in their ant-like perfection of rank, gossamer weapons and bright eyes instinct with heartless menace. Their too-perfect countenances belie the horrors of war, and their flawlessly-arranged uniforms will all too soon be marred with the gristle that Yurgen's barbarians are even now coated head to toe in.

Four long, nimble limbs, several sets of human legs apiece ending at sharpened points, scramble across the ground, leaving pin-pricked holes as their sharpened points ravish the earth. Skin cracked from the cold is wrinkled between rows of whale ribs fused to its hulking "body". When the Walker runs above some hapless soldiers, the ribs part, skin stretching like bats wings as it crouches and snaps down, scooping them up between those ribs into a yawning cavity full of predator mandibles.

Romping towards the front-line of fae, the Walker stumbles as a rib sunders within the leathery pouch of its gut. Chi-Yosh falls to the earth beside it, arching up for another attack, yet the thing proves faster, righting itself before snapping the gaping maw downwards. Back and forth the Dawn tumbles, taking passing swipes at the Walker's legs. Though they are two thighs thick, and prove harder to wittle than anticipated. After several failed attempts at snatching the Solar, the agile necroptic stitchwork darts back and kicks the Dawn, sending him sailing several yards to roll across the frigid ground before hounding after its prey.

Rolling to his feet shakily, Chi-Yosh reaches into the dense jacket, grabbing his belt to whip it outwards. Liquid ripples and streams out like a lash, the weapon Cresting Wave surging within his fist. As the Walker bares down before him, the Solar leaps backwards, snapping his fluid armament downwards, sending an arc of water splashing across the cold earth, right in the path of the Walker. The sudden splash of water is nearly solid before hitting the ground, but does not freeze until dirt is mixed with the lifegiving fluid. One bony appendage hits the water-soaked patch, its spike skidding, and its weight bares it forward, sending the dead flesh pitching off its feet. Right upon the water-shaped spear Chi-Yosh had set into the ground.

The point impales through the center of the Walker, pinning rib-webbing shut. Boney legs clack, scraping at the ground as they fitfully try to right the bulk back up, but only scrape furrows through the unpurchasable earth. And no time is spared to it; the Solar leaps atop it and begins tearing at the stitching holding skin and bone together, punching through the hard latticework of bones, until he picks apart the spine keeping the Walker together. Soon, the assembled parts crumble into three segments, sagging between the bridges of parchment-like skin. Tearing the bits from his hands, Chi-Yosh reclaims Cresting Wave, hunting for his next target.

Elsewhere, the other Solars who participate in this battle fare equally. Ramar has little to do to defend himself, for he has a companion. Heaven's Iron Mountain Shield, the impregnable stronghold of animated rock, is his guardian. The golem defends his master adroitly and ably, punching hard enough through one onrushing jackal-zombie that its fist connects with the one directly behind it, swatting away javelins or sharpened bone-fragments answering the same purpose, and moving with the speed of lightning and the sure power of the Imperial Mountain.

The noise of battle is usually where Egress feels most at home. Still, there's something about this battle that is distinctly wrong to her. Using two hated enemies against each other ought to be more satisfying. Still, there's more than a bit of Silver Pact honor in her bones now, and it wrankles to share the glory of such a victory with the Fair Folk.

She has little time to waste on such thoughts, however. There is still glory to be had, and it seems enough for both the Zenith and her fire god steed. A greater darkness looms as a last guard of the Ghastly, massive and black, a cloud of shadow that has no form but drives men back with the power of its fear alone. This is something worthy of a Zenith, something that her powers alone may overcome.

Egress bursts into a greater light still and directs Rain of Fire into that shadow. She extends a hand and a burst of pure radiance leaps out and strikes the darkness. For a moment, the blackness gathers, drawing together like a flowing pus, trying to withstand the revealing light. It shatters with an explosion like thunder and bares its source.

Rearing suddenly as its illusion is shorn is the form that looks rather like a pale snake. Yet the eyes of those nearby reveal it something far worse. It is no thing of flesh, but rather a body of rot and filth, full of maggots and countless corpses. Fearlessly the God of Fiery Rebirth charges against this hated foe, this abberation against nature.

It is the light of the sun and vicious flames of the dragon that beat down the great serpent, and all about bits of it fall away, scalded, some incinerated before they even reach the ground. Leaping from the back of Rain of Fire, Egress lands atop the head of the beast and dragging her spear in one long, cruel slash she races along its full length, dogging arrows of friend and foe alike and leaving in her wake a wide opening.

At the back of the Zenith swoops down Rain of Fire, a long gout of angry red flames tracing that wound and sending the heat of the earth's depths into the beast. At the very last moment she seizes hold of Egress with a claw and rockets upward, leaving behind a burning form that thrashes mindlessly, the spirit that once held together its many fouled parts failing. The way is open.

With his guardian fighting back the hordes of hungry dead, Ramar is left free to Channel the Essence of the North. The ice and snow obey his command, flying as true as any arrow fired from Davron's bow. Enemies further afield are not nearly as safe now that their legions cannot stand between them and Ramar's sorcerous might. Further, works of magic are rent and undone, bands of Sapphire and Emerald Essence wreathe Ramar's body, glittering in the gold-white pyre of his Anima.

And when there is little enough time for magic, when ice and snow have answered Ramar's final call, flames spring in his hand. Swift South Wind cuts through dead flesh and unhallowed bone, shattering and scattering the enemy as he and Iron Mountain Shield march forth to aid their companions. Against the might of the Solars, the dead shall fall.

Then of course, there is the matter of the Ghastly itself. It strides out, tortured and rotting limbs moving at awkward and impossible angles. In its wake, undead and the living alike can be trampled. Each footstep echoes with a cacophony that would rouse mountains from slumber. Then... then it comes. It begins with a soft shift in reality. A subtle shimmering-the Ghastly's movements become more surreal. The thunderous sound of its footfalls sound more fluid, and those trying to speak nearby find their voices tangled, caught in their throats in the same manner as one who tries to speak within a dream. The Fair Folk are striking now. Their gossamer weapons and their very bodies seem to glow as Essence floods the area.

The ground beneath the undead behemoth's feet changes slowly, subtly. Where it's feet land soft ripples begin spreading over the ice and the snow. The Fair Folk's soldiers march through the hungry legions, their haughty commanders riding atop beautiful white stallions. Ahead of them, the blood of the Fair ones mixes with the ice and snow, their bodies fall slowly, glamorous and glorious even in death. For every Fae that falls, several more rush forward. The behemoth itself is beset on all sides now by the warriors of the Wyld. Generals and Warrior-Poets cry out at the behemoth, their voices becoming harsh and cool in the air. Their words are incomprehensible. Beside them, loyal soldiers charge forth, trampled underfoot while still more begin swarming the great beast.

It shimmers beneath the assault. Glamour-forged weapons shine brightly as they strike the dead flesh, soldiers are plucked from the great behemoth, and still more fall when the spirits that help maintain the beast rush from open wounds to fight. And all the while, the air around the behemoth changes further. Each Fair Folk is living and dying as he was meant to. Each one is fulfilling their purpose in the story. Now comes the story's end. After all, every great battle must end with the forces of righteousness triumphant. The ground itself seems to rise with the host of Fair Folk. Every snow flake is a perfect mirror of one of the Fair Folk, each crystalline facet of ice holds its own world. In each world, each reflection the behemoth is beset by glamour, by gossamer webs that spin deep inside its carcass, seeking out the dreams of the dead, the haunted memories of life. And then, in one perfect moment, a cataphract clad in brilliant crimson armor wielding a spear made of starlight strikes the ground. A

Every last mirror-world explodes. The behemoth in each reflection is pierced on all sides by the spears of the fair folk, and shards of ice bury themselves in it. Even the snowflakes seem to explode, sharp as razors, slicing through warriors that cling still to the dying beast's carapce, opening great wounds for strands of glamour to fall within. These wounds turn to the stuff of nightmares, the stuff of the Wyld. The razor snow becomes a deadly voice echoing throughout the cavernous body of the behemoth, sending what evil ghosts remain within fleeing from their host for their sanity. And from the inside out, the nobles of the Fair Folk unmake their glamour, and in turn, the behemoth.

---

The tribes of the North retreat from the valley, leaving the remnants of the Fair Folk to hold their own against whatever the dead might do. Creatures from the Wyld and the unalive are both enemies of mankind, but the sage's words that "those that draw a blade against you save another for each other" are still true. The two supernatural armies have little love for each other, and have little need for provocation to continue fighting.

Yurgen has invited the Circle to join him in confronting the Syndics of Whitewall. "I ain't slingin' fancy words, just makin' my position clear to those yammering gods," he explains, in his typically lucid and articulated fashion.

Davron grins. "Well, if you _do_ need any fancy words for anything, I'm sure you know where to find them," he says, gesturing to Ramar.

The irascible Solar, along with several of his senior chieftains, and the Circle along with their supernatural allies, approach Whitewall. In due course they are recognized and shown in. Yurgen wastes no time in his dealings with the three spirits seemingly formed of sculpted ice who rule the grand city.

He contends that he is capable of fending off both the Deathlords and the Fair Folk, at least from the city, and that the current treaty the Syndics have requires rather onerous burdens. It is more-than-whispered within the city walls that when not enough criminals are expelled from the city in a given year as part of that treaty, that citizens are instead selected. The Bull is just diplomat enough to gloss over this point, instead suggesting that in alliance with him, all lives would be equally safe.

In time, the Syndics relent somewhat. "We will watch your further battles, for you have invited them upon yourself by your actions," one of the ice-gods whispers. "Within a year we will give you our answer." This satisfies Yurgen, and he calls upon Ramar to seal a pact with the three, that they will promise to evaluate this offer seriously, and that he will not renege on his offer of protection.

His business is concluded. Yurgen announces his intention to return to the Icewalker lands for now, to resume gathering strength. And so the future ruler of the Northern Threshold steps out of the city gates, and into the white-swirled morning air. He turns, waving to the Circle and grinning fiercely, then walks across the Road toward his waiting entourage.

"We have done well," says Egress quietly. "Our word has been kept. But the North shall call to us again, I think. Friendship is a bond that does not end." She turns to look at Rain of Fire, nodding deeply to her. "Thank you once again for bearing me into battle. It is an honor that I shall always strive to prove worthy of, my friend." Turning back to her Circle, "We must go back now. There is, as there always shall be, much more to do. Still.. I think we can afford a few days of rest, don't you agree?"

Davron smiles and nods, rubbing the still-healing scar along one arm where a lucky arrow had bitten too deep. The scar will be gone in a few more days, but... "I agree. I want to be at the peak of my abilities once more before I return to my work on the city."

"My sentiments exactly, Egress m'dear," replies Ramar. "A few days of rest and celebration are in order, and our way of honoring the fallen, remembering their lives so that they themselves do not forget and rise again." He stretches his arms towards the sky, and sighs very contently. "It feels good to finally get the job done."

Chi-Yosh glances out over the frozen planes. "Another behemoth has fallen to our exploits." Or at least, to actions heavily influenced by the circle. "At this rate, we will have left none upon Creation."

And Iron Mountain Shield merely stands silently amidst the Circle. An incredible amount of pride and joy seems to permeate its being, and its stance and wary gaze seem relaxed among the company of the Circle. It has protected Ramar and in doing so fought off hordes of the dead. Indeed, there is nothing quite like the feeling of a job well done.
