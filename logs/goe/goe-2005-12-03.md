After the great battle, Ramar has spent some time healing his wounds and preparing for the next one. He's studied plans for the great city and spent time simply relaxing. Now, however, he calls out to Katya. It is a difficult thing to ask the goddess of abrupt arrivals to simply appear. His Caste Mark glows bright enough to be seen even in the daylight as he calls to her from the shade of a nearby tree. Then he settles back against the tree, looking as though he might begin to daydream when she arrives, with all the subtlety befitting one of her station.

Ramar has not long to wait. As he tilts his head back against the tree, a dazzling flash erupts from above him. The next thing he sees, and feels, is a foot being planted directly on his face. The weight of a spry girl is applied without apology, and is as abruptly lifted as Katya Ken vaults off his head to land on the grass in front of him. She turns, smiling, and waves as though nothing amiss had happened.

Ramar staggers up from the tree, and greets Katya Ken. "Good day. I've called you here so that we can discuss the terms of our agreement. A knight-errant of your own in exchange for one of your Names. That was it, was it not? I intend to hold you to those terms. I need to know what kind of knight-errant you want. What your knight should be like and then I will need one of your Names."

The spirit scratches her head. "Knight-errant, huh? Hmmmm... Oh! I did ask for that, didn't I." Suddenly she sounds enthusiastic again, now that impulse has aligned with memory. "I want a handsome, beautiful, dashing knight in white armor, with umm, long hair! And he's got to have a nice sword. Well, I don't so much care about the sword part, but it's got to be a really good weapon. He should be a snappy dresser..." Katya is babbling.

"... And he's got to like _poetry_, and be a good _horseman_..." Katya ticks off a few more qualifications.

"Yes. Yes, okay. Right. I've got the idea. Believe me. No need to go on. One dashing knight in shining armor. He'll need a name, of course. As will I." Ramar makes a mental list of the qualifications Katya drones off, "You will of course want him to protect you."

"Yes! And we can go riding, too," she adds. "And umm, umm, he's gotta be bold and noble. .... So... umm."

Katya pauses. "Vanileth told me how to do this, to give a Name. If I am slow about it, be patient, alright?"

"Yes. I will. I understand, and I will be patient." Ramar nods, "I can hope that you also understand the patience and care I shall take in crafting your Knight."

Through light and darkness and light, Katya teaches Ramar one of her few true Names. It is the name of the Abrupt Transition, embodied by rangers, spies, and cats. It is the Name given to those who are never seen to disappear or reappear, whose presence is only missed too late and noted after arrival.

Through use of this Name, the speaker can gain such powers. It is not stealth, for he is no easier or harder to detect than before. Katya explains that it is also associated with the moments of sunrise and sunset, moonrise and moonset, and associated with the five constellations in the House of Journeys.

After the meeting with Katya Ken, Ramar spends some time lost in thought, trying to come up with a likely candidate for her White Knight. The idea he reaches is not a pleasant one... but it just might work. He sends a summons to the rest of the Circle, hoping to gather them together to see if they have any insight on his plan. "You see, I think we might be able to tame a Fair Folk and have it be her Knight..."

Egress listens to that, her ears pricking up at the mention of Fair Folk. "Where exactly do you plan to keep something like that?" She frowns thoughtfully, "And.. where exactly will she be feeding her knight? Is this truly the best idea we can come up with? The symbol of her knight will be one of sworn enemies. Indeed, an enemy of creation itself?"

"But would a heroic knight such as the one the Fair Folk embody endanger those he is charged to protect, or even harm an innocent?" Ramar begins listing the qualities Katya described. "They are Creation's enemies, yes, but perhaps not every last one of them must be."

Davron rubs his chin. "Just because Katya wants her dream knight doesn't mean it needs to _be_ a dream. I'm not saying you _can't_ make this work, but... well, I have to admit the idea makes me a little uneasy as well."

"I surely won't want any Fair Folk to ever be in our city," says Egress. "The thought of it is madness, I think." She frowns and lets out a sigh, "Why not make use of someone who isn't mad. I'm sure there are some who would be very pleased to be so close to the Gods. I imagine we need not look so far afield."

Ramar nods, "It makes me uneasy myself... but then we are Solars, are we not? Isn't this the sort of thing we can do?" Ramar looks off for a moment, staring beyond the world it might seem. "Or I am going more mad than I thought... but I don't think that they must all be our enemies. We deal with demons and death... why not this?"

"The problem that I see, Ramar, is this: if you constrain the fae so tightly that Katya's white knight _cannot_ betray us, you may break its spirit so much that it would no longer be acceptable to Katya. And if you _don't_, well..." Davron trails off. "Do you see a way out of that dilemma?"

"Fair Folk are Fair Folk," says Egress softly. "If you shatter it with magic and warp it into something else-a rather huge waste of time and effort I say-then it is no longer what it was. Just as essence may shape the whirling madness of the Wyld, it may shape its children. The question remains, is this what we ought to be doing right now? I say absolutely not."

"We don't necessarily have to shatter it... but... if we do it... if it worked. If we could find a way around this problem... just think. We could change the Fair Folk across Creation. No one would need to fear for their dreams. We could make the world a better place. We could... we could..." starts Ramar.

"We could change a handful of Fair Folk into something else," says Egress gently. "But the Wyld shall always stand, Ramar. There will always be more Fair Folk. I think so long as there are dreams, there will be those who feed from them. I know you might wish for a perfect and complete ending, but I do not think that is the nature of things. Creation requires life and death, pain, love, joy, and sadness. I do not believe any of these things can have their meanings if they lack their opposities."

"But think of how it would be. It would be a place that was..." Ramar begins again, and then stops as Egress' words hit home. "You make a point," he says, gently, after a time. "I believed so much that I could do this... I just... I want to do what's right. And this would not be. No. Life without meaning is... too dark a thought to entertain further." He takes a deep breath and sinks back in his chair, looking tired. "What should we do then?"

Davron chuckles. "Well, if we have ruled out the fae, what does that leave? The most obvious next step is the world of humans."

"Her request is very specific," says Egress. "But let us think of our own people first. Ramar, do you remember a certain deal made with Great Forks and the Dragon Blooded in our own Nation?" She smiles and nods, "Do they not seem to have something of an affinity with the Gods? Unlike many they delight in the presence and even coupling with spirits. While I'm not precisely sure that this is what she wants, I have a feeling from your description that she is not looking for just a knight but.. well, for someone who is at least capable of being a romantic partner." Egress smiles and says, "It is lonely on the heights, dear."

"Not as lonely as it could be though," replies Ramar, with a smile towards Egress. "Not quite so lonely. Very well then... we'll see who we can find then, and perhaps see abotu finding a suit of white armor."

"White Jade," suggests Egress. "I have a suit myself he can have. That surely is a worthy of her knight, don't you think?" She cannot help but laugh a little over it. Knight, indeed! "I just wonder if we should pretty them up a bit first. I have no idea what she'll be like with her knight, honestly. She's not precisely.. well, in any case, we'll just see who is willing and go from there."

Ramar nods, "Very well then." He chuckles, and seems raher curious to see how Egress handles herself. _Like mother like daughter..._ "If you've someone in mind, let's go find him."

The Dragon Princes have done well by the land they claimed from the Nation. A small portion was set aside in return for their services during the earliest founding of the Nation, and now they have become a fully-integrated client state following a brief period of observant distrust. Already, stone buildings - almost universally shrines to some spirit or another - have begun to appear among the wooden homes and businesses. The elemental powers of the Hundred Kingdoms region, plus the visiting divinities from Great Forks and a handful of barbaric, foreigner gods from further east in the Threshold, all have presences and mortal servants represented here.

Here, the Dragon Princes live as did the Terrestrials of old, side by side with the spirit world. And yet they commit acts which would be blasphemy, heresy, or at the very least a perversion in the old ways of thinking. As the Solars arrive to speak their minds, they note the alien heritage of the unseen world in many of the children who run and play on the verdant grass that freely grows within this walled, wooden city.

Boonton it is called, the boon granted to the Dragon Princes by their Solar neighbors and masters. At the center of it is the Benevolent Manse of the Arbiter of Rightness, the city's chieftain. And at the front doors to this half-alive abode, Ramar and the others are met.

Their host is a smiling man whose black hair is done into a queue that hangs to his waist, dressed in silk robes. He clasps his hands together and bows respectfully, averting his eyes. "Welcome, friends," he intones. "Your message was received. I am to escort you to the presence of the Arbiter of Rightness."

"Thank you for receiving us on such short notice," says Egress. She bows politely, adding, "It seems that much has been done here in so short a time. A great deal of progress, indeed. I had no idea how much things would change." She is impressed, even if she's not entirely sure that this is quite right.

The Circle is led into the Manse itself. As they walk, they discern what has been done here. A grove of trees that once formed a minor Manse here has been expanded upon. The construction is quite cunning, for the Second Age. And yet, Davron has beheld the works of the prior Age, and what he sees is a growing child straining to reach something just beyond him. There are glimpses of true brilliance in geomancy here, and yet they remain only glimpses. Perhaps this is due to the influence of the spirits on the bloodlines of the Dragon Princes. Such musings come to a halt as the group enters a wide, open area - the 'front room' of the Manse, near to the Hearthroom itself. Seven men stand at attention here, and Egress recognizes some of them from their initial meeting. Their Caste Marks shine brightly on their brow, a proud display of their Exalted heritage.

The man in the center of the group approaches, then drops to one knee in a respectful bow. The others follow suit, and the man speaks. "I am the Arbiter of Rightness for this city. We are at your service."

"Thank you Arbiter. I am here to find someone to serve as the Knight-Errant for the goddess Katya Ken." Ramar begins, a little unsure at first. He begins to explain just what such a job would entail, and where the knight would likely have to remain. He dances about the details, revealing them in a gentle manner, adding them on one by one until it has all been laid bare, so to speak. "And thus, we came here..."

The men have risen as Ramar began speaking, and they nod amongst themselves. "There is only one man for this task," one of the Exalts volunteers, and glances at the others. Each nods his silent assent, and the original speaker finishes with his name: "Burgundy."

---

The Solars are escorted through Boonton. And, inauspiciously, they arrive at a house of healing. A layman of the Immaculate order is standing outside, and bows low as the group enters. Within, raucous, drunken shouting can be heard. Within, an Immaculate monk is holding a half-dressed man in a 'Haltan Spider' grappling move. The man being held is struggling futilely, and shouting every manner of vulgarity. His rich black hair is out of its queue, and is flailing about just as much as he is. His face would be handsome in repose, but not just now. "The knight, Burgundy," the Solars' guide announces, by way of introduction.

"Charmed," says Egress, looking anything but. Still, this is quite fitting, she thinks. "I imagine when he is not in the arms of another he is reading poetry?" She can't help but smile quite cheekily at this. It seems the dunce prince has been found for the insane goddess.

"I wonder what he's like when he's sober," says Davron, quietly. "Does anyone around here know?"

The guide answers this, for the Immaculate is too busy restraining his prisoner, and the man himself is incoherent. "Burgundy is the child of the City Father of Nathir, city of spices and wine. He inherited a great deal of the culture and class of his sire, but, ah, inherited other qualities as well."

"I see," says Egress quietly. She's trying so hard not to giggle right now. Heirophant of the Deliberative, Queen of the Nation, Zenith Chosen of the Unconquered Sun. And here she is, listening to a drunkard curse. "He definitely does have an eloquent way with words," she says. Her eyes light up just a bit and she listens carefully. She's never even though about that part of a yeddim's anatomy before! "I think he's _fascinating_."

The monk finally releases his grapple with a regretful sigh, then swings a vicious chop at the base of the drunken knight's neck. He falls, senseless, and the monk makes a brief gesture of contrition to his patient. "He will recover shortly. I will detoxify him with _yaru_ root." He bows, then moves to take his leave.

Ramar considers, "Well, I don't know about the rest of you... but I think he's perfect."

Davron rubs his chin, then nods with a smile. "It seems to be our fate, of late, to take those individuals that the present system can't or won't do anything with, and help them make something of themselves."

The guide sighs a bit. "Please do not get the wrong idea," he half-whispers. "He is an exceptional man, a skilled swordsman and rider. However, ahh, his intemperate quality in this specific case has led to a deficiency of marriage opportunities."

"Exceptional men often have exceptional flaws," says Egress. "I'm sure it will be fine. In a way, I believe we have accidentally found the ideal person for the task! All will be well." She sounds supremely confident, somehow. "After all, Ramar, surely this isn't going to be any harder than your first idea, is it?" She can't help but laugh now, though it's not mocking, it's warm. Her laughter is something that hasn't been heard a great deal as of late..

While the Solars consider this dubious turn of events, the Immaculate has time to return. He has stirred together a sweet-smelling concoction in a ceramic mug, which he forces down the unconscious man's throat. "He will rise in a mome--"

The stuff is fast-acting. Burgundy's eyes fly open, flutter, and he lets out a yelp. The Immaculate hauls him to his feet, helps him steady his balance, and sighs as the knight once again passes out. "Return in a few hours," he suggests gently.

---

The Solars spend their intervening time exploring the city and speaking with some of the people. Many mortal soldiers, servants, wives, and children came with the Dragon Princes. They have been supplanted by groups of people in the Hundred Kingdoms region, who have immigrated to live under the protection of these peculiar Terrestrials. In due course, suitably enlightened, the Solars return.

Burgundy is immensely presentable, and he meets them at the door of the healer's building. He wears the fine silk robes of his kind, embroidered with otherworldly sigils and characters of the Old Realm script. His black hair is pulled back into a handsome queue, with hints of alluring disarray in the bangs. His eyes are steady, strong, and deep. His gait marks him as a cultured warrior as he steps forward with the grace of a panther. His respectful bow of greeting is picture-perfect.

"I am Burgundy, son of Nathir." His voice is a rich baritone, full of contrition. "I apologize for my earlier display. It was unseemly, and I have disgraced myself."

_Recognizing when you are in the wrong is the first step to correcting it,_ thinks Davron as he returns the bow. "It is good to make your acquaintance, Burgundy," he says - but this meeting is in Ramar's hands, and he will allow his Eclipse companion to present the offer.

"I am Egress," says the Zenith calmly. She bows deeply, quite surprised at the change. Surely this is the same man, but how can it be? Whatever they have given him, it has certainly done its job! She waves a hand and intones, "There is nothing to fear. The gift of redemption is offered with the coming of every new day."

"Burgundy, son of Nathir, you are not disgraced. You are called to the service of Katya Ken, whose stewardship of the great City requires a knight-protector. The Arbiter said that of the many here, you were the one who could serve her best." Ramar finishes speaking and allows his words to sink in. "Will you accept the call, and serve her to the best of your abilities? It would honor both us and her, not to speak of what you will reap from service."

Burgundy drops to one knee, as did the Arbiter before. "I am honored and privileged to serve, my lord." His voice holds passionate restraint, and eagerness.

"Then rise, Burgundy, son of Nathir, knight of Ranapura in the service of Katya Ken. Take a few days to put together your affairs and then return with us so that you may meet the goddess," says Ramar.

"I am ready now, my lord. I have.... I have nothing but what you see here," the knight replies, quietly enough to hide his shame.

Egress smiles and says, "Now, just a second. Hmm. I think something is missing!" She turns about, looking skyward. "Where did I put it.. let me see." She raises a hand, aiming it with great care into the sky, and from it projects the very light of the sun in a focused blast, sent skyward not as a weapon, but as a beacon. "Should be but a moment," says Egress calmly.

For a while there is nothing. At least five minutes pass while Egress waits, unmoving and clearly untroubled. Then a great fire explodes in the sky, and there is the blasting of horns and a proud music booms. From the sky comes Rain of Fire, who in her right talon bears a suit of white jade armor and in her left carries what appears to be a finely wrought trunk. The music comes from the gates of the city, where a large procession awaits. But first, there is the matter of the dragon to deal with. The sheer majesty of Rain of Fire makes her identity clear, and those in this place know her as well as they know her rider, so that when the armor and the trunk are set before Egress none cry or raise arms.

"Now come, Burgandy son of Nathir, the Knight of Ranapura must be given the arms worthy of his station!" Egress' voice booms out as loudly as the music, seeming somehow to join with it. She strides forward, bowing before the great dragon, "Thank you, my friend. Once again, a most timely arrival." The dragon bows its proud head, so that the Zenith may settle a hand above its brow. The trunk and armor stand waiting for their new owner to claim them.

Burgundy clasps his right fist within his left hand, bowing low as he is able to do without abasing himself. "I will not dishonor them, nor you," he says with conviction.

Egress smiles at Burgundy and waits for the man to rise to go over and put a hand on his back, leading the way to the gifts. "Now, the armor I think is clear enough, but let's see.." She pauses in front of the trunk, looking thoughtful. She gestures for the knight to open the box and smiles warmly as the contents are revealed. For a large part, the trunk is full of the finest in clothing. Shirts, breeches, some fine boots as well. But that is not the most important of the gifts, for on one side are many books of poetry. The works of the masters are all there, in both translation and in their original forms. Naturally a personal touch was desired, so Egresss included a few of her own work as well. "Still, our knight has one more need, and for that, we must go to the gate." Egresss' words are kind, and she nods to Rain of Fire, who rises into the air in a gust of warm wind. Another tremendous gout of flame lights the sky and the music grows louder still near the gates.

The Zenith leads the way to the gates, and in the wake of the Solars come children and others who are now curious. Egress will find near the gates that the leaders of the city have come already before her. "Ah, my friends, it is well that you are here already. I am afraid I may have offended, but I do relish surprises of the best kind. But first, I have a last detail to attend to with our knight, then I shall turn my mind back to the other surprise." The Zenith turns back to consider the procession and with a clap of her hands causes its ranks to divide in one smooth, efficient motion. A sergeant near the front salutes her and calls out, "Present the steed of the Knight-Protector!" in a voice as clear as cloudless day. Up that sudden break in the ranks is lead a fiercely proud steed, with a black coat like midnight. Surely this is not of any eastern stock, but is rather one of the finest horses of the Marukan.

Egress smiles warmly, nodding to Burgandy to go forth. Midway down the ranks, the horse and the knight meet. The steed stands obediently, letting the knight swing himself astride. A joyous shout comes then from the soldiers, as they see another fine rider joining their ranks. A man whom Egress hopes will prove to be an able commander for them, as well. She turns back to the city leaders then and smiles, "And now, the parting gift, for friends should never depart without leaving something of themselves behind."

Egress does not need to give the command. The sergeant knows his place quite well in this and cries, "Come forth, free bearers!" For there are no slaves in the Nation of the Sun, nor shall there ever be. The ranks divide farther, opening many wide lanes so that carts may be drawn down them, upon each are many boxes. "A gift to our loyal friends," says Egress, and she waves her hands, so that those upon the first carts, which have been turned to show their contents, will draw open the gifts and reveal the jade armor that lies within. "One hundred of them, my friends," says Egress.

The audience of people, mortal and Dragon Prince alike, gasp in awe. And that, really, is all that they can do. Words aren't enough, and they realize it.

---

After presenting Katya Ken with her Knight-Errant and sending a knowing look to those deserving one, Ramar retreats away from the crowd and returns to the Book of Three Circles. He opens it up, and requests, "Show me what you can about stretching out the minute and the hour, not merely viewing between it...." He is not seen after that. Not for another three weeks. Three weeks of channeling Essence, studying the Book, reviewing arcane principles... and prayer. _If I can even do this... I'll need all the help I can get._

Time passes. Ramar is exhausted from research, his dreams are haunted with possibilities, magical and mundane that stretch out before him. If this spell works, he knows he must be careful, lest he do more harm than good. _Creation's no good... I'll have to head into the Wyld. This may be one of the most dangerous things I'll ever try._

And further consultation with the Book reveals that there's a way to protect himself from the Chaotic influence of the Wyld. Three weeks pass. The others have gone about their business on Ranapura's behalf. The Circle's goals all seem to be coming to a head soon. Now that the time for studying has passed there remains one thing left to do. He leaves a note, informing that he shall return within five days, and what it is he is attempting to do. He makes the last few arrangements and leaves a tender note for Egress as well, before speaking Katya's Name and heading off for parts unknown. Heading off in the direction of destiny.
