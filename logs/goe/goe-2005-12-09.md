Egress rarely makes promises lightly, nor has she very often delivered a promise of this magnitude, to not just disrupt the power of the Realm in the northeast of the threshold, but to turn that spear against the Realm. She says only that she has a promise to keep, and takes those who are willing with her. Rain of Fire and Jin-nu both wish to attend her, naturally enough, and they will make their way carefully to the lands they must reshape. Lands where the Realm's dominance is welcomed mostly as an economic boon, and because they are still seen as the greatest power in Creation. Still, the certainty of that wavers, the confidence cracking, ripe for the shattering.

The power of House Ragara is felt in these lands, and though Egress knows that the power of Solars is greater, she uses caution. It is not an overwhelming show of force she wishes to use here. Instead, she sends out a far more deadly weapon ahead of her. She begins by visiting small villages near Minnaturo, spending just a few hours in each, and in each she does one act of kindness. Certainly many will realize what she is, but her raw presence utterly over awes mortals, and her soft words work in them with a potency beyond that of swords. And so the story begins to spread, of a demi goddess and her entourage who bring peace and justice to those about them.

By the time Egress arrives at the fortress of Minnaturo, stories of her bubble through it. The gates are open, however, which is strange. That was hardly expected, but is most welcome. Egress enters the fortress with a confident stride, followed on either side by her friends. The wizened woman who greets her near the gate presents herself as the Will of Minnaturo. From the tales that Egress has learned while travelling she knows that this woman is descended from a long line of women who have coupled with the city god, each producing an heir that in turn becomes the Will of Minnaturo, and who will eventually produce the next Will of Minnaturo in her time, perishing when her child comes of age.

The conversation with the Will is a very strange one. Or would be to mortals. Thankfully, Egress has Rain of Fire with her, and with her assistance she was able to speak with a very ancient spirit that dwells not far from the borders. The Will of Minnaturo is presented with a single silver bell by Egress, a handful of hops by Jin-nu, and a chalice of sea water by Rain of Fire. The old woman smiles and bows to each, leading them in to speak with the city god. Minnaturo himself appears as a dashing young man with flowing hair as white as ice and eyes that are unmistakably ancient. The Solar bows politely, treating the god as a respected equal, no matter that his borders have drawn in very greatly.

What follows is something of a curious sparring match, delivered entirely in an ancient mode of poetry called Grei-tan, which follows a very rigid cadence structure as it is chanted. Egress is not a bureacrat, but she is a forceful speaker who matches very well with the skill of the god. It seems Minnaturo is so pleased that someone treats him in the way he himself requested so long ago that he at first forgets under whose sway his land lies.

Egress brings this point to the fore, carefully guiding the god back to the present and the reality of his situation. She paints the picture of the Nation of the Sun, where chaos and disorder was ground away and in its place the power of the Solars and their Celestial allies brought glory back to the people. It is not greed, but the thought of being more able to defend his people on his own terms that appeals most to Minnaturo. If Egress promises to keep the power of Ragara at bay for one year, an army shall be readied to throw back any undesirable influences from the Blessed Isle.

It is everything Egress could wish. Sure, it is not the strongest of promises, but it is a promise, and one that the god seems quite likely to be bond to, even if Egress hadn't arranged for the Sidereals to show up at a most convenient time with a young Eclipse to make the pledge binding. With one nation willing to cast off its chains, Egress turns her mind on the next.

The aptly-named Truefeather proves most polite, his easy words demonstrating a social talent that is most helpful in smoothing out the last details of the agreement. Moreover, Egress is able to convince the kindly Eclipse to go on with her, so that they both might learn from each other. The next goal is to address the rather shaky peace between Icemount and the Deathdrinker's land, where Minnaturo says the living and the dead stand on the very brink of open warfare, held in-check only by the power of Ragara. She is warned that Ragara keeps forces there at all times, to enforce that peace and prevent any raiding of their wealth.

As in many conflicts, the point of contention is almost comical to those outside. Egress is not laughing, however. A very modest manse with a black history stands equally between the two, and stands as the point of their wrath. While that is the crux of the issue, it is not there that Egress begins her work. Instead she meets with the Dragon Blooded of House Ragara, who prove to be a proud but frustrated lot, stuck in this land due to misfortune, so very far from their families and their ambitions. These are the men and women Egress must win. Truefeather, though he has faith in Helios, can but calmly question the sanity of the Zenith he is following, but the confidence of Rain of Fire and Jin-nu, not to mention that of Egress herself is more than enough to set a fire within him, and he strides forth, calling upon the Dragon Blooded in a bold, strong voice, that they will come out and treat with the envoy of the Celestial Deliberative.

This call draws attention, and some measure of fear, once the glow of Egress' caste mark makes it clear that this is no joke. She presents herself with no weapon, no armor, but her words are again more than powerful enough. She does not shame these terrestrials, but instead touches their souls, even weeping over their unworthy positions. But she does not simply lament, she speaks instead of what might be, what ought to be, and what will be for those who seek it. There have been whispers that others, yes, even of House Ragara have come into the service of the Anathema. And here is such a one now, seeking their allegiance and promising a greater glory.

But what of the tales of Anathema? What of the bogeys that sent children darting under the covers and led men and women to dedicate their very lives to the protection of fate? The image is torn, then obliterated. There is a power that still dwells in the Dragon Blooded, the old oaths broken once long to hold once more, and the thought of golden banners and glorious victories against Creation's enemies sounds far more impressive then keeping money pouring into the coffers of those that cast them out in this forsaken land. Still, there is the matter of ending this conflict.

For the first time, Egress exerts her will with a show of force. She calls upon both cities to send forth their leaders to battle over the Manse of the Blackmere. There, on top of the dark waters, with the Solars witness, the two sides give battle, their mad feud presented as a fight between twin gods, brothers whose only inheritance-the manse itself-they could never quite share. When they have battled for a full day, Egress and Rain of Fire walk forward. "You are cast down," she says flatly. "Your people starve and die, you have lost your way." Her eyes are disdainful of these pitiful siblings, and rather than face the wrath of the furious Zenith and her entourage of Dragon Blooded, they fly, their hearts burning with malice, and yet even as they depart they lash at each other, as they likely shall until they are reduced to shadows.

Egress turns to the Sidereals for guidance, now, who show up timely as ever, bringing with them two prospects, a pair of spirits who will take over as the city gods. The two both attune to the manse, and with the power of Truefeather a bond is made between the gods and Egress, pledging aid to the Deliberative so long as it aids them in throwing off the power of Ragara. A shrewd bargain, perhaps, but with all the enjoys of Ragara at her back and heeding her words, Egress is untroubled. With this act, the word of her presence spreads like a roaring torrent, so that only the most sheltered hear nothing of her deeds.

As Egress proceeds, she finds her ranks growing. Six Dragon-Blooded ask to go on with her, while five remain behind to assist the new city gods and help the people recover from the long, pointless skirmishing.

Egress leads her new friends upon Skinner's Walk next, where she finds the work quite handled already. She finds upon the ruins of the old city center a dusty, ragged man holding a small scrap of paper. He greets her by holding it aloft, and on it Egress sees a sketch of herself, made in charcoal. The vision brings a smile to her lips and she greets the man with a very slight bow, "You have brought yourself much glory, Red Tusk." The man considers Egress for a moment, bowing more deeply than she does. "Much remains to be done, Ikth-ya," he replies. He cares nothing for the Deliberative, but he knows the name Egress who was Gallius, whose circle came back from the Well of Udr, who has faced Oblivion and death itself yet returned. "The stones shall lay where they have fallen."

For that is the wish of Red Tusk, who has now gained vengeance upon those who slaughtered almost all of his people. Few still live, and these are leaderless. With disgust, Red Tusk sets them flying across the bitter ground that they stole from his people generations ago. Those who survive their punishment will be the stronger for it.

The Dragon Blooded hear the true stories of what happened from Red Tusk, and while they might at first be apprehensive, even revolted by the uncivilized Lunar, they know the desire for vengeance most keenly, each having in one way or another been cheated of a fine future to be cast away, and with a few soft words and observations from Egress, their minds are opened, and yet they still see in the Zenith a gentleness. She may not stand against the righteous wrath of the Lunar in this case, she will put no cities to death on her own. She has claimed three lands for the Deliberative and inspired the destruction of another without doing more than holding the curious spear of prayers.

The final two targets are Harborage and Omen, and there can be no doubt that both cities are keenly aware of what is happening. The remnants of Ragara's forces have gathered in Omen, and it seems that all that must be done is to get them to listen, though it is rather doubtful they will be willing to lend an ear to one who already has 'corrupted' every Dragon-Blood she's encountered.

Fortunately for Egress, she need not be listened to to exert her influence. They are wise enough to not allow her near, making it clear they will do horrible damage in battle rather than be taken. Yet they need news, they need to hear what is happening, and so Egress moves about the small villages, even telling stories to children and giving food to the poor.

And the Dragon Bloods, so thirsty for news of her, wanting to know just what this demoness is doing, drink up every scrap they can. Again and again they are confronted with the honest kindness of the Zenith. They seem unaware that their own spies are leading to their downfall. By the time they are aware of the nature of this curious influence there is mutiny in the air, and half the garrison deserts in the night, casting open the door so that Egress and her followers may enter the fortress without battle.

In the end, only one of the Dragon-Blooded still stands against Egress' words, spouting venom and in a fit of madness dashing at her with a table knife. Egress never has a chance to react, for the singing of Moutin-boul's bowstring comes far too swiftly, the shaft of the Immaculate of Wood dropping his crazed fellow like a stone before he takes his second step. There is silence for a moment, and then Egress bows to pray for the reincarnation of the lost one to bring him peace. With a flash of golden light his soul is entrusted to the care of the heavens.

With Ragara's Dragon Blooded swayed, the mortals follow swiftly, quite happy for any promise of change. Egress makes no false oaths, however. She only swears to do all she can to cast down the madness and greed of the Realm and restore it to its glorious beginnings, where shallow bureaucrats were not able to destroy a worthy man's life on a whim.

The arrival of Egress at Harborage, where the remaining mortal crews of Ragara's ships await, is not so much a matter of cautious diplomacy, but something of a victory parade. Rain of Fire happily allows a young boy to present her with a flower, Egress finds many garlands of the bright blue caraiel flowers of the land laid at her feet, and when she meets the city council, they are expecting her to accept a crown. Gently she corrects them. The promise has been kept. The lands have been stolen, Ragara's own now stand at her side, preparing the cities for a battle that she will never allow to occur, and Truefeather is willing to stay and help the lands be put to rights, accepting a final promise from Egress that she shall direct other Solars to join him and protect that which she they have all worked so very hard to gain.

And yet Egress does not leave with just her friends, for Moulin-boul insists that his place is at the side of his brothers who fight at her side. This Egress does not argue against, gratefully accepting his service. It is with a joyful triumph at her back that Egress returns to the Nation once more.
