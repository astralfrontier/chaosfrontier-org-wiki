# Gods of Eden 2005-12-23

Ramar has gone to the Wyld to learn magic. The other members of the Circle are present on Ranapura. The flying city drifts gracefully through clouds, and with it, the Solars and their allies take stock of their new prize.

Among the many wonders here is a relatively mundane item - a submission from Marina, written on several scrolls, detailing the mercantile possibilities of a flying city as a traveling port of call. It outlines a strategy for economic competition with the Guild.

The proposed plan is straightforward, but complex in its permutations. It speaks of bringing together artists and masters of the crafts and sciences, because unique talents suit the city's nature better than mere bulk power.

Indeed, a city that flies should draw not the many, but only the greatest. "What we need to do is sift through the tales of greatness so that only those avenues that truly lead to remarkable people remain," suggests Egress. "Still, we need a point of origin. In Nexus there is trade from all corners of Creation, and there we may judge the great by their own works. It will simply be a matter of following those stories back to their points of origin. We must proceed with caution, however, lest the Guild learn of what we are doing before the time is ripe."

"Although," notes Chi-Yosh, "Nexus may not be the only place to seek out. Perhaps to we should look to those who not only are the best, but those who have the potential to be. That which has not ripened, that way we give them the opportune environment to flurish." A nod towards Davron. "After all, they all start in little towns stringing bows, after all. And those who have not become the greatest success yet would not have the resources to cross Creation."

"It is an origin point," says Egress again. "We cannot visit every city, but there we can learn which lands we would do well to visit." She smiles and notes, "We will need a great deal of silver for this. We must be noticed in Nexus, I think, and Nexus swiftly notices the wealthy." Of course, with the power of essence, Egress can see to it that all in power swiftly notice her coming. "I would like to bring Rumika with us. Will she come to our aid, Davron? I have a special task for her."

Davron seems distracted, and the mention of Rumika's name gives him quite a start. He does not answer immediately, but the dream he dreamed the night before comes back in its full measure, and he seems to live it again.

---

In the dream, Davron stands before a cliff. It is similar to the one he encountered in the Labyrinth of Lies. This time, the Clock King's vile perversion of his craftsman's soul is not etched on the rock. The cliff face is pristine, virgin, awaiting the touch of the hammer. On the beach stands a woman garbed in silk spun by the very Queen of Spiders herself, for it shimmers in opalescent majesty as the sea-borne mists rush past it.

The woman's face changes as the tide rushes behind her. Sometimes the cheery vision of Willow, sometimes the unutterable beauty of the sorceress Rumika, whose chains of bewitchment tug at his heart. Sometimes he sees other faces, all beautiful in their way, all bearing the seed of love. All potential queens for his kingdom.

Behind him is the cliff. In his dream, Davron has labored long in his imagination, and a throne-room of surpassing splendor is at the forefront of his thoughts. The essence of craft is the endowment of a dream into the hands, and skillfully Davron teaches the cliff of his wishes. The tongue of rock comes fitfully, but he cannot help but overwhelm the very stones and pebbles with the desire he feels. The cliff throbs with Essence as the outpouring of his desire concludes, and raising his hammer, the Solar brings it crashing down upon the stone, striking the nexus point of Essence.

There is a tremendous explosion. The cliff crumbles into powder and dust, swirling around the two human figures. For Davron has not wrought mere destruction, as a barbarian might. He has struck at only the unnecessary parts. His magic forged a design within the spirit of the cliff, and he has knocked away the superfluous from it. By reforging the spirit, he has reforged the land around it. And as the dust-cloud settles, perfect thrones of gold are set upon a perfect marble dais.

Egress notices that Davron is off in his own thoughts. It is something that she has grown rather accustomed to. It's when his greatest ideas seem to come to him. "Well, perhaps I'll just handle that invitation on my own," she murmurs. "Chi-Yosh, do you agree that Nexus is an adequate starting point? We can expand from there, and use those we find to seek out still more. It's the same way you find the best horse thieves, really."

"That is a good enough spring board for our search," responds the Dawn. "Nexus does have the best, and we need masters before we find apprentices."

"If you could arrange the appropriate guards and gear for the trip, I will focus on the special requirements of our voyage," says Egress. "Oh, and I think that medicine is a craft we will wish to draw to us, as well. If you have suggestions for how best to attract the interest of healers, I will certainly listen and provide assistance."

Chi-Yosh looks thoughtful. "I would say the best starting point is to appeal to their access of materials. Nexus has a great many herbs, but the Nation of the Sun has access to more of the rarer from the East at a cheaper cost. However, if they are dedicated to doctoring, they may not come; Nexus's people are large, with many in poor squaller, in need of help."

Egress nods to Chi-Yosh thoughtfully. "Then it is our duty to supply them," she replies. She bends her mind to still other thoughts, as well. "We will send word to our cousins that the city of the Celestial Deliberative seeks the most talented of artisans. This is not our city alone. With the aid of all of our allies we will find men and women of great talent." The swiftest path is magic, which draws Egress to turn to the Priestess and the Sidereals. She will open her mind to her advisor, trusting her judgement, but making it quite clear that Marina's plan is to be followed. It is only the manner in which it is followed that is open for debate.

The Circle has friends and allies in Nexus. Ragara Soras Minan, the abolitionist, is well-placed in high society and has a strong desire to aid the enslaved. As Realm client states typically enslave the artisans of their military conquests, she is happy to find a permanent place where such men can be forever free of domination. And Davron has spoken mysteriously of "another gift" that can be given for those who will not enrich the city so much, but who nonetheless deserve a life and livelihood away from their former shackles.

Pai Tao, the dealer of ensorcelled trinkets, has seen every manner of crafted wonder. He provides a long list of Dragon-Blooded candidates when the Circle's messenger comes calling, bearing the seal of the Nation of the Sun.

Nara Temi, from Great Forks, once gave Davron the golden tools forged from _ho te ri_, and he has fulfilled his promise to her to beautify the world. But he was not the only artisan who sought her out. She too can provide references for many of the prominent Exalted craftsmen in the Scavenger Lands, and she languidly acquiesces to writing letters of recommendation for her most promising scions in the art of occult craftsmanship.

From Nathir, City of Spices and Wine, comes a mortal woman called the Queen of Cups. She has been blessed with a lifespan thrice that of other mortal women for being one of the prized consorts of the city's patron spirit. She has devoted her life to the grapes and grains that make wine, and she is said to have actually forged a pact with the spirit of the forest in which many bee-hives live, so that she alone can harvest honey no other mortal could. Burgundy, chosen knight of Ranapura's patron spirit herself, brokers the exchange, and the flying city leaves Nathir richly endowed from the Nation of the Sun's bountiful harvests.

And a few days' march away from Nexus, a small crowd of refugees has reached a verdant hillside, with Davron at the head, and several of his other Circle-mates helping to keep the crowd in order. The Twilight craftsman looks at the hillside before him, and rubs his chin. "Good rock in these parts..." He kneels and runs his fingers through the earth. "Good soil too." His eyes move further up the hill, and he grins. "Oak and beech... perfect. Keep everyone back, all right?" he says to Egress. "This could be dangerous to bystanders."

Davron begins to walk up the nearest hill, his fingertips brushing along tree trunks, occasionally sifting through the dirt, murmuring in a soft singsong that speaks to the small gods of the earth and soil. In his wake, there is an almost imperceptible _brightening_ - the Sun seems to shine through the leaves with a particular vigor, as his Essence begins to permeate the landscape. Flocks of birds emerge from the trees, and squirrels scamper away - they have heard what Davron has in mind, and flee to seek new homes for themselves.

The Sun has traveled well in His course along the sky before Davron comes back down, his anima blazing, and picks up a shovel. The dirt seems to be as light as air as he begins to dig, and yet it does not collapse about him as he digs deeper. In mere minutes, there is a tunnel through to the bedrock. He runs his hands along the granite, whispering to it, listening to the earth's reply... and then nods. "This is the spot..." he says, pulling a golden hammer and chisel from his belt. "Get further back!" he yells, at the top of his lungs. "No, further than that!" When the onlookers are well away, he raises the hammer, and his anima wraps itself around it, setting it afire. Then the hammer comes down upon the chisel.

Nothing seems to happen - not even a crack in the stone where the chisel struck. Then, a basso rumbling, as if the very earth has begun to shake. Which it has. The trees on the hills above Davron begin to tremble... and then, all at once, the trees _explode_, their leaves blowing out in a great cloud. Only a careful observer would notice that many of the fragments of the trees are _lumber_ - beams, lintels, boards, in regular shapes. The shaped remains of the trees fall to the earth - and into it, as the dirt has become like a liquid beneath them. Davron begins to back away, the swiftly-dug tunnel collapsing neatly on either side of him and leaving him untouched by even a grain of sand.

As Davron makes his way back to the waiting multitude, the reshaping of the hill continues apace - shafts of bright golden light occasionally radiate from the churning, roiling earth, signs of some Essence-fueled transfiguration within. For a long time, it seems as if he is merely demolishing the hill. And suddenly, the dirt flows away like a receding wave into the valley below, revealing spires and craggy rooftops...

Davron's fellow Exalts are reminded, somewhat, of the raising of Ranapura from the depths. It is as if there had been a village here all along, just waiting for the touch of Davron's hands to unearth it. The trees have become window frames, doorframes, doors, and other wooden accents. The bedrock beneath now forms the crucial structural members of houses and shops and storehouses. And even much of the soil has been transformed, fused into panes of glass or sandstone walls. Not all of the trees exploded, either. A handful of the trees had sunk whole into the earth, and now are scattered in auspicious locations throughout the new town, providing shade and comfort.

The buildings have a rough-hewn look, to be sure; but they are well-proportioned and sturdy, and need nothing more than proper finishing, need only to be carved with whatever decorative style their new residents favor. Great mounds of dirt did not flow away; but it is but the work of many wheelbarrows to clear the streets. The buildings are not furnished; but great piles of lumber are scattered about, ready to be shaped by other craftsmen as they see fit.

Davron wipes his brow. "Behold," he says to the awe-struck crowd. "Your new home."

But the work is not quite finished. No town is complete without a god to look over it, and a blessing worthy of it. A great offering of silver and the finest of livestock has been brought from Nexus to sacrifice to Valeo, God of Spontaneous Wonder. With the city fully prepared, the god waits near the city center, where a well-built house has apparently caught his fancy. Led by Egress, the new people of the city follow in wide-eyed wonder, still not quite believing what they are seeing. Their every gasp and every cry of a happy child who has never known a roof of their own is an offering to Valeo, so that when Egress approaches the silver is ordered to serve as a coffer for the city and the livestock is to be delivered to the farmers.

Valeo has a different request, and to this Egress gladly agrees. For a full night she is relieved of her worries and serves only as the musician for the city's celebration. While the music fills the air and Valeo sets the sky aglow with patterns of light, Marina's quiet will prevents a single conflict from arising as the families select their new homes. Only when the town sleeps peacefully does the music of Egress stop, her voice by then a soft lullaby.
