# Gods of Eden 2005-12-30

_This is something I have to do. That's part of the price of making the world a better place. You have to actually try and do it._ Ramar glides through a sapphire sky as twisting energies cascade upwards from the ground, casting an odd glow upon the Volo as it soars through the Wyld. Reality has faded to mere hints and guideline... the background theme of this place, and even that is not apparent in a few places. Crystals made out of solidified fire come together to form a makeshift tribe of beings, marching desperately towards a sea of fantastic proportions. Around Ramar, though, the pattern of reality, of Creation holds firmer. Essence shores up his being.

It takes a while for the preparations to be complete. These preparations are made even more difficult by the fact that in this place, Sunrise and Sunset are fluid things, seldom connected in the same way twice. It is done. Essence flows through Ramar and out into the Wyld, gathering up the twisting nexus of possibilities and folding them together. Around Ramar, the chatoic rippling of the ground grows more rythmic, more stable and slowly begins to spread outward. It's noticeable as an area of unchangingness... an island from which Essence flows shaped only by Sorcery.

Time itself begins to unfold before Ramar. The Sorcerer, trapped in an area of his own making, can do little more than watch as he guides the energies. There is no chanting, no gesturing... such things would only distract from the sheer force of will needed to keep things from spiraling out disastrously. Through the soul of the sorcerer, magic flows, and time is grasped. When at last the blaze of his anima fades, motes of light echoing around him, Ramar sinks to the ground and fades away. Time passes.

Within the warded area, time passes differently. Where a day passes in Creation, a year stretches out before Ramar. A year of work, of solitude. A year of fervent design and occult rituals designed to stave off the inevitable confusion of experiencing two times at once. His work is fruitful, the notes he'd made from the Books have helped his project soundly. Though he cannot bear to channel more Essence while sealed away from the rest of the world, his theories seem sound. And the last few days of the year are approaching. The last day he spends in meditation, preparing his mind for reintegration with the natural flow of time. He is not quite ready for it, ready for the sheer exhaustion, the conflicting signals he must put up with... but he weathers it. He fares better than many, and strides out of the Wyld... _Hopefully I shall not have to do this again... not for a long while..._ But more than this, his friends are on his mind. He's been gone for so long... it's time to go home.

And so it comes to pass that Ramar returns to his friends, eager to see what has changed during his absence.

After a day or so of rest, Ramar once again boards his Volo and leaves for Ranapura. _They did it!_ Excitement is on his face, and he is utterly unable to contain his delight as he arrives at the city with a word. A Name, really. He simply turns up, and sets off to find the others, to bring them news of his journey, his success.

Davron is standing on one of the parapets of the Gear building, feeling the high breeze blow through his hair. The logical reason is to acclimate himself to high altitude, but in truth he's just admiring the incomparable view of Creation through the clouds. He turns... to find Ramar standing there, and takes a step back. "Oh! Welcome back, Ramar. When did you get here?"

Chi-Yosh can be spotted from the Gear buliding roof. Flitting from one rooftop to the other like some feather caught in the breeze, the Dawn is going through daily practice. While not all the pathways to being better is achieved simply through rigorous training, it helps clear the mind, and allows him to think at the same time; a more active form of meditation. Though, he stops, wiping sweat from his brow, and takes note of the Volo landing. Off he goes, streaking towards the tower.

"I just got here. I've um, well I've been gone for a bit. It's strange how long it's been. You'd barely believe me if I told you. I barely believe me but... wow... you did it. It's... it's up in the air!" Ramar beams, looking about, watching as Chi-Yosh is inbound after a while. "It's nice to know I've not been the only busy one lately. But all... all business aside, it's good to see you again. I've missed you all!"

Davron gives Ramar a brotherly hug. "It's good to have you with us again," he says, his eyes twinkling. "Now, what do you mean about us not believing you? Look at this!" He waves an arm to indicate the entire panorama. "Do you think I would've believed, two years ago, that I'd be responsible for something like _this_?" The Copper Spider grins. "Ramar, my friend, we're long past mortal notions of believability. Come inside - I'm sure Egress will be thrilled to see you too. And you have to meet our City Mother and her knight! She's... changed, now that she's in charge of a city. Though a lot the same, too, of course."

Chi-Yosh vaults over the parapet, landing on both feet set wide. He takes a breath, easing the air out in an exhausted sigh. Crossing to Ramar, the Eclipse is clapped across the back and afforded a smile. "The Dreamer returns."

"Returns fromt he Wyld with fantastic tales of beings that would twist sideways as soon as lookit you." Ramar laughs and hugs his friends, "But... then someone's got to do the dirty work. It can't all be flying cities you know... but... I must say I'm impressed, and proud to have you guys as my Circle. As my friends!"

Chi-Yosh casts a glance over the view, admiring the whirls in the clouds and Creation below. A side glance back to Ramar, providing a pleased nod. "Aye. And, how did your research go? The spell you went off to investigate in the chaos Essence?"

"Oh... it went well enough. We'll see how it goes when I get the chance to cast it. It was an interesting experience, researching out there...but I don't want to have to do that again for a while." He smiles, and looks off in the distance, but all too easily, his gaze slips back to his friends. After all, Creation can wait... here's his Circle. It's been a year. At least. Or just a few days. "Has there been any sort of trouble?"

Davron chuckles dryly. "When isn't there trouble, in this age? But we've been handling it pretty well so far. We've _all_ been quite busy, of course."

"Ah good... erm, well I was just making sure I didn't miss anything that I was sorely needed for." Ramar chuckles, "AH, it's good to be home. What's in the works now, I wonder?"

Chi-Yosh glances outwards over the city, towards the bureaucratic halls. "Perhaps Egress can answer that."

"Ranapura is becoming a _working_ city, as all true cities must be," explains Davron. "We are attracting craftsmen and tradesmen from around the world. A flying city can go _anywhere_ in Creation, and faster; even the Denzik city-ship cannot match us for speed, let alone mobility. And a flying city can carry more goods than the biggest of Guild caravans."

"Good. It is time to attract more than cratfsmen and tradesmen. If we are to truly be a city of the world, we'll need to make contact with those who've been... wel been away for a while. When we've time... I plan to head for the East to speak with the ancient trees... trees older than time itself, they say. I believe we can learn much from them, for they have seen much during their time, which makes even an Exalt's time seem no more than a drop in a bucket..." Ramar pauses somewhat dramatically here. "But erm, I plan on offering them my spell, that knowledge in exchange for their knowledge, and perhaps we can get them involved in the Deliberative. Give them a reason to be involved in the world of men, if only for a short time."

Chi-Yosh tilts his head. "That is a wise thought, as beings so old would have collected the whispers in the winds. But, you will give them your spell, and it will be gone from you? As Ra had given his memories? Or just share?"

"And from there... well, there are plenty of others who can benefit from this life-preserving knowledge. We can keep trading, information for information, secrets for secrets... bring the world a little closer together while we do this. There's so much out there to learn," continues Ramar. He then replies to Chi-Yosh, "No, I mean to share it. So that I can still make use of it as needed."

Davron looks inward, contemplating the enormity of Ramar's dreams. "Binding all of Creation into a working whole... every part aware of its place in the greater scheme..."

---

Right now, the whole is far from unity. Yurgen has only started his battles in the North, and it is rumored that two Lunar packs are working with his slowly-expanding Circle in the war on two fronts. The Fair Folk are enthusiastic warriors, and the Bishop is a Deathlord who does not take well to affront despite his mad state.

Rumors from the Realm talk of a schism within the Immaculate Order, brought about by some monumental spiritual revelation or other act of highly-visible heresy. Trade is down, with the exception of imports of weapons, armor, and steel.

Gilthane to the West, and Mai-Bo and her friends in the Southwest, send Infallible Messengers that talk of a coming storm or great battle with the Deathlords, particularly the First and Forsaken Lion. To the East, the Dowager sleeps fitfully, still nursing her wounds and grudges.

Walker in Darkness and the Mask of Winters have both issued formal statements of neutrality to the Nation, the Confederation of Rivers, and Lookshy. This is no surprise from the Mask, but Walker has traditionally not shown interest in mortal politics.

Despite the troubling reports coming in from all corners, a few reassurances arrive as well.

The team dispatched to Denandsor report startling news - some of the city's self-repair systems are operational again. The Sidereal called the Engineer sends a personal handwritten missive to Davron with a few terse words - "We can dock your flying city to Denandsor and use its defenses."

Davron excitedly shares his note with the Circle. "We should go there right away. It's still going to be some time before Ranapura can fend for itself against our more powerful enemies. I need time to work." The mechanical contraption on his shoulder nods in agreement.

The men and women of House Ragara, who assisted the Circle in bringing up the city, are well-acquainted with the niceties of command. They have been put in charge of operations, leaving the executive decisions to the Solars. In return, they too have profited immensely from the legendary store of First Age wealth the city possesses. This suits them fine.

The power of the Heirophant is not barred by oceans, nor even great distance. Every tale, every picture, every thought of her has its power now, and she may use it to free those she has never even met. Or at least give them a real chance. Her Ragara contacts give her names of prominent house members. Immaculates give her names of truly devoted monks. With an exertion of will Egress reaches out through the tales of her deeds. Though the telling may be twisted, her power makes weak the lies, drawing out the truth, the greatness, and the glory of her cause. Where the teller speaks of chains, her image glows of shattering them. Where the teller lays murders at her feet, the power of essence reveals those she has risked her life-even given her life-to save.

The very powerful propoganda of the Realm that is spread so dutifully even now undermines itself and begins to work like creepers in a great wall. Where there are cracks in the armor of lies, the power of her presence thrives, and as the cracks grow deeper and wider, the truth inevitably begins to pour through.

As the sun sinks low in the western sky, the great control room at the peak of Ranapura is bustling. Ramar maneuvers the flying city into position over a pair of ancient towers in what was once known as the Empty City. His hands dance over the control panels, positioning twin panels on the underside of Ranapura above those docking towers. Even with the glowing scrying-globe giving everyone a real-time view of the docking operation, it requires a delicate and deft touch to avoid smashing into the towers and crushing the delicate Essence-transfer apparatus installed there.

"We are in position!" calls Ramar. Davron nods in acknowledgement, and barks out orders of his own. "Chi-Yosh! Prepare the city grapples!" Chi-Yosh nods, and places his hands into the control gloves - and as he does so, there are two distant **thumps** as the giant panels slide open, and enormous claws like spider legs unfold, poised over the dual peaks that cast their long shadows over Denandsor.

Davron turns to Egress, sitting on the great chair in the center of the room. "Heirophant, we're as ready as we're going to be. Shall we commence docking?" Egress looks over the room, reads the quiet confidence in her Circle-mates - and nods. "Do it!" she says.

Chi-Yosh's hands tense in the waldoes, and the docking clamps reach downward, clasping onto the towers as if fishing some great wreck from the ooze, as they once had done in the city's aquatic former life. As Chi-Yosh guides the modified salvage claws into position, lights flash across Davron's control board, and he yells, "Contact confirmed! Ramar, take us down!" Ramar's hands become preternaturally steady on the control yoke, and the great city lowers itself, the docking arms retracting back into the bulk of Ranapura.

Ramar calls out, "It's going down too fast!" Davron curses, and presses his hand on a golden panel, channeling his anima into it. The panel confirms Davron's unique energy signature, and authorizes access to the power controls for the city. Davron flips switches and adjust dials like a madman, and throughout the city of Ranapura, lights flicker and dim; for Ranapura draws much of its power from the sun, and as the sun goes down, it takes more and more of the Gear's energy just to keep it aloft.

As Davron struggles to keep the city afloat just a few seconds longer, Chi-Yosh calls out the range on his own console. "Fifty yards... thirty yards... ten yards... five yards... zero!" At the final word, there is a sudden lurch, and a low grinding sound, and the city seems to tilt, as its weight begins to rest on the towers.

"Ramar, zero descent now!" yells Davron. "We have full contact! Channeling power!" At this point, Davron is putting his full trust in the Engineer. If the thick web of Essence cables that were strung along the outsides of the two ground towers cannot handle the strain, then Ranapura will lose lifting power utterly, and rip the two towers from their foundations as it crashes into Denandsor. Saying a prayer to the Maidens, Davron pulls the two great levers on the top of his console...

For a long, anxious second, nothing happens. And then, the bases of both towers are kindled with brilliant amber, the light rushing up along the network of cabling and into Ranapura's underbelly. As the power feeds into the system, an eldritch blue light issues from the opened panels... and a wave of lights sweeps out from the central tower of Ranapura as power is restored.

And finally, hatches open around the periphery of Ranapura, and beams of actinic light focus themselves on various points in the Empty City. As they strike home, the streetlights of Denandsor itself blaze into life again, as some of the power diverted from their Manses is channeled back into the network. Ranapura's swaying dampens, and then ceases completely, as the smaller city balances perfectly on ten pillars of light, poised as if it had always been meant to rest atop Denandsor like a citadel in the sky.

From his vantage point near the very bottom of Ranapura's belly, Chi-Yosh breathes a sigh of relief. For several terse moments he had doubted Davron's calculations. "I think she's going to hold," he says into the communications panel. Looking over the Empty City, seeing the path of destruction he had lead through, the Dawn is glad his second visit will be less eventful.

In his sanctum within the groundbound city, the Engineer activates a sequence of controls, channelling Essence and operating more purely mechanical devices in equal measure. Around the Empty City of Denandsor, a light begins to shimmer. It solidifies, growing in brightness and power. An audible hum fills the air. The long-forgotten, disused barrier system has been activated.

And in the director's chamber of Ranapura, a luminescent pane of light springs to life. The Solars turn, to hear the Engineer's voice come through the flat, floating curtain of illumination: "Step through, into Denandsor."

There is little to do, then, but step through the pane of light. Ramar walks forward, a curious expression plastered to his face... _wow_

The Engineer is waiting as the Solars arrive, and he smiles. "Two cities, joined as one. The protection of Denandsor, the mobility of Ranapura. In addition, this docking allows us to load heavier defensive wonders onto your city - a drydock, if you will."

He regards Ramar with eyes that narrow. "Your skills will be called on as well, sorcerer. There are attacks against which a city has no defense, even one such as this."

"Of course. I shall be ready to help however I can," says Ramar, bowing his head a little as he looks around. "Thankfully... there will be those of us who can help defend the city... cities."
