# Gods of Eden 2006-01-06

The Circle of Solars departs from Denandsor in a manner as befitting them. They fly, be it on Volo or Dragon, towards Rathess. The echose of an age long past seem louder as they draw closer; here a hint of some arcane efficiency in the canopy of the thick jungle or scattered bits of ruins there. They arrive without much in the way of ceremony-just a simple if elegeant landing that brings them once again to the ground.

There are few, if any, who witness the Solars as they secure their respective mounts. Weeds seem to shift towards the newcomers, though it could simply be the wind passing over them. Green stretches out over the outskirts of the city, nearly infesting it. It has not been tended to in some time, though there are still paths apparent, still places that were meant to be walked. The signs are there for those who've learned to see them, and Ramar motions for the others to follow after him as they proceed deeper into the city.

As the Circle passes through the ancient tunnels, Davron reflects that though he has visited the ruined city before, he will never find it truly _familiar_ - or at least, not in many mortal lifetimes. The angles between floor and wall, the shapes of the abstract glyphs carved deep into walls, the peculiar tapering of support pillars - every detail of architecture serves to remind him that this city was not built by humans, or for humans. It is still of Creation - the Dragon Kings were the mortal lords of Creation in the time before man - but it is alien, all the same. The occasional collapsed arch or tumbled pillar only heightens the effect.

A pair of pillars leaning outward mark one of the entrances to the lower tunnels. The markings on the walls which must have once served some nigh-unfathmoable purpose are worn and shot through with roots. Water drips slowly, passed through where plants dare to break through, creating an eerie echo in the darkness beneath Rathess. After a time, it is only the light of their Caste Marks which allows them to see what lies before them.

Egress does not find this place so foreign as the rest of her circle. Certainly, the Dragon Kings were different, but in studying their tongue, in talking to them and even in brushing against death, she came to understand them better than any have in centuries. She brushes a hand against the pillars and speaks softly, the tongue one that hasn't been heard here in nearly an age. Though there is nothing to be seen there is a feeling of sudden stillness, as if even the walls grew more silent to listen to the ancient words. "There are devotions to the Unconquered Sun here," she murmurs, indicating a piece of script upon the wall that has not utterly worn away.

"This was once a City of the Sun," notes Ramar. "And he still is there, still lingers. He must... even if only in the back of their minds. There has to be a way to turn them back towards the light, to see them blossom beneath the gaze of the Unconquered Sun once more. Together we can be greater than before."

"They have never turned away from the Unconquered Sun," answers Egress. "They offered themselves as the final sacrifice, they were loyal when they were abandoned. They.." She frowns thoughtfully. "They suffered a grave injustice, but it was not Lord Helios that abandoned them. It was the Solars. We have much to answer for to these former allies."

"Then we shall answer it..." says Ramar, grateful for the sketchy lighting, "I was mistaken, but then I suppose I have much to learn about them still." There's not much he can do to hide the embarrassment in his voice though. "There must be something we can do... perhaps... perhaps we can give them a dream to follow. Touch their minds deep within themselves and reawaken that part which lies dormant now..."

Chi-Yosh feels the gloom and weight of the tunnel and ruins in the air as in the mood. "The Solars have had much to answer to Creation for. As we have worked to clense that impurity, we shall in this."

Davron moves quietly along with his companions, saying nothing. Though the restoration of the Dragon Kings is indeed part of the burden the reborn Solars rightly bear, he has not felt called to take an active role, save when his Circle-mates have need of his own skills.

"They are following the dream," says Egress quietly. "They have faith in my vision. They have faith in the new Solars. I will lose my soul before I let them down, my friends." Though her words are dire, her expression is calm, a warm smile on her lips. "It is just my imagination, perhaps.. but I can almost see this place as it once was. Perhaps when I spoke with them I was brushed with those memories. It was so glorious. I can't imagine a grander vision. So strange and wondrous. I wish to see it again. I wish to have them make at least part of Ranapura their own, as well."

Ramar nods, "There are so many who can share and learn from Ranapura and what it represents. I only hope the Mother of our City can appreciate the enormity of her family," he adds, with a bit of a chuckle.

When the chamber is reached, the circle finds that those sent have been busy. They are greated by a leathery skinned dawn caste named Falling Rock. He bows politely, his voice grating out, "Your timing is impeccable as ever, Champions of Ranapura." Yes, even here, in Rathess, the word has spread of the city's rise.

Inside the chamber, the circle finds the work that has been done. Dozens of pens have been carefully constructed and many-times repaired. Now all the scars on Falling Rock are old. There are many alien shapes in those pens. The most dramatic is that of the Pterok, a beautiful (to Egress' eyes) winged Dragon King with a great headcrest of many colors. In the less elaborate pens are kept many long-necked Dragon Kings that are more human in shape, and eyes that hint at great intelligence, as well as claws and muscles that speak of terrible power. In the corner is a lone pen filled with water, and in it swims another of the ancient creatures. "You have done incredible work," says Egress.

Falling Rock looks to Egress. For a moment, he seems on the brink of doubt, but Egress steps forward, setting aside her things. "This shall take some time. Falling Rock, I would appreciate your assistance. I also will require focus. I must go out to on the very brink," she explains. She says to her friends, "There are many things to be seen-to here. There are other tasks. This one is my own. I shall require nine days. On the tenth, I shall lead the Dragon Kings above ground again, and we shall walk in the light of our Lord together again."

When her circle leaves, Egress can focus completely on her task. She surveys the pens carefully, letting her mind drift. Since her passing at the hands of the Deathlord, she has learned that can slip past the bonds of herself more completely. She finds the words at last she seeks. The chanting is in the tongue of the Dragon Kings. From the first word the creatures react. Some begin with resistance, smashing their cages, roaring and thrashing madly. Yet Egress knows no fear. She speaks on, pausing before the cage of a great Anklok, the creature towering above her. Falling Rock steps forward and Egress nods to him. The cage is opened.

The creature seems wary at first, then comes out to battle. The first test is strength. Egress does not meet power with power, but rather with grace, tracing the footsteps of an ancient cermonial dance. A dance that served as the only rite that the solitary Anklok gathered to perform. Unlike in men, the memories of the Dragon Kings goes back forever. The bindings of the past are strong in them, and the great creature cannot strike Egress as she dances.

Egress concludes the ritual and with a gesture of ultimate authority, orders the creature to its pen. It strives to resist, however, and with a terrific flow of essence Egress knocks the beast backwards, putting forth the power of the Unconquered Sun's essence. For every creature captured this must be performed. For the Raptok, it is done to all of them at once, and so the first day of work ends with both a reminder, and a direct exposure to the power of Lord Helios.

The second day is much the same, only on this day Egress enters the pens of the Dragon Kings. Even that of the Mosok, which forces her to fight for her breath as she swims in the graceful arcs of the aquatic Dragon Kings. Again she powers her essence into them, but on this day it is not to force them to submit, but to draw their minds past the limits of the moment, to make the animal in each of them strive past its dumbness, it's utter waste of potential that she coaxes out with the ancient tongue and the gift of essence.

On the third and the fourth day she releases the Dragon Kings from their pens and faces them all for an hour. When they are utterly spent and bruised by the power of Falling Rock and the Heirophant, Egress begins to read from one of their holy books, speaking of the glory of the Unconquered Sun, the virtues of loyalty and the great gifts that come to those who are true to the cause. She reminds them of the fall of the Solars and the terrible punishment that was brought down upon them. But in that failure is couched a promise. The new hope.

What comes next is the truest work, however. The spark of the past has been settled upon the kindling. It is up to Egress alone to see that it bursts into flames. On this day, she draws the Dragon Kings from their cages once more, but there is no fighting. She raises her voice into a soft song that begins before time. The song starts without words, for there was none to speak. There was only chaos.

Then to the chaos came the gift of form. In exchange for the loss of the inifinte shapes of the madness there was growth. Into this gap sprung the Primordials, the ancient masters of Creation, from whom all else were born. The Gods are drawn from the power of the Primordials, and the first living things fill the still land. Hills rise, and the Dragon Kings at last come to the land that has for so long laid quiet.

The moon swings overhead. The sun streaks across the sky. Time passes. The enormity of the years is enough to bring an opressive weight to the room, and even Falling Rock can sense it. Finally there are words. The ancient High Holy Speech of the Dragon Kings, the first tongue ever spoken by a mortal is the song. On it goes.

Men are born, and the Dragon Kings guide them with wisdom, with their gifts they help men feed themselves and scratch out a living in the dangerous lands of Creation. Not all is right, however. The heavens are stirring, and madness is threatening existance. The Gods rise against the Primordials.

The world is nearly torn asunder. The Dragon Kings betray their makers, rushing to the aid of the Unconquered Sun and standing beside the newest Heroes of Creation, the Chosen.

Together they cast down the Primordials, killing many of them and casting their corpses into the Underworld. The rest of them are bound away, sealed from Creation. The victory of the Gods is complete. Yet not all is right, for as time goes on, the madness of the Primordials can be sensed in the air. The greatest of their enemies, the Chosen of the Unconquered Sun himself, the closest to kindred the Dragon Kings have among men, have gone mad. Yet the Dragon Kings remain true to them, avenging the bloody overthrow of their friends.

Many of the Dragon Kings offer up their own hearts to the Unconquered Sun, proving their devotion, but gaining no respite. Finally, they are gone. The song grows very quiet. The weeds grow in Rathess, the glorious walkways are cracking, the most ancient of cities lies dumb, the inhabitants once sought all over creation for their wisdom and spiritual guidance were reduced to nearly mindless beasts. Yet all was not lost.

For as the Solars had failed the Dragon Kings, so would they try to save them. One came back whose memories for these ancient friends had not faded utterly. She walked the lands, growing stronger (as she deemed it) yet did not understand how temporal her own life might be. When she was brought back from the very edge of death, she knew then what she must do. With the aid of her Circle, she was able to speak to them again, for the first time in an age.

The power of this song is fuelled with essence. Every hill revealed as a ghostly image, every face, every terrible turning of the tide in war after war. Until at last it resolves into this day. But it is not the day the song began, but rather the eighth day that Egress at last stops singing. The Dragon Kings lie about her, unmoving, but not asleep.

They wander in the land of dreams. They stretch out their minds, feeling something reaching to them. Something warm. Yet they do not recall how to draw it back in. It has been far too long since they have done such a thing. There is one, however, who has done something much like this all too recently.

It is through a projection of will. It is with gentle words and patience that Egress guides them. The surrendering of the body to the soul, the unsundering to be made whole once more. She recalls it much like a dream, and with the softness of poetic words she leads them one by one back to themselves. On the ninth day, the Heirophant at last sleeps again, and outside their pens, the Dragon Kings stand vigil about her, saying nothing, but looking at each other and at last truly seeing.

The tenth day comes.. and Egress leads them from this darkness towards the light. The first words of the Dragon Kings shall soon be heard with the rising of the sun, for no cloud would dare bring darkness when the loyal followers of Helios are climbing to the temple they devoted to him over an age ago.

Davron's own expedition takes him far afield from the pens of the young Dragon Kings; but in a way, he also is taking part in the restoration of the Dragon Kings' heritage. An ancient airship lies fallow in Rathess' halls, and in the fullness of time, the reborn Dragon Kings will have need of it - although for the time being it will be himself and his Circle that shall have the most immediate use for it.

Stalkers still prowl the ancient halls of Rathess - it would have been impractical for Falling Rock to corral the entire massive population at once - and other dangers lurk in the collapsed tunnels and undergrowth. Fortunately, Davron's route is fairly direct; the glimpse Sa had given the Circle, many months ago, included enough of the surroundings that they were able to gather a rough idea of its location. And thus it is not long before the Twilight Solar stands once more in the shadow of the flying vessel.

Full restoration of the craft will have to wait for the drydocks of Ranapura and Denandsor - the centuries have laid their weight on even the nigh-imperishable First Age construction, and virtually none of the flying machine's systems respond to the controls - nor would they have if the control consoles themselves were functional in the first place. Fortunately, the ancient Dragon Kings and Solars alike built to last in more ways than one; most of the more perishable components were built to be interchangeable, or nearly so. The great airship will not be able to fight, nor execute fancy aerobatics, nor carry the loads it once did. But it will fly.

Working with magical artifacts, made from the Five Magical Materials and other strange Essence-bearing materials, is much harder than working with mundane substances. It took him less than a day to build an entire village from scratch; but it takes nearly as long as that for him to go over just one of the engines with a fine-toothed comb, using his toolbelt as well as channeling Essence from his own anima, to identify the burned-out or depleted devices that will need to be replaced, the miscalibrated Essence channels that need to be adjusted.

Three days pass in all, as Davron ruthlessly cannibalizes weapons, defenses, and other less critical systems, installing the salvaged components in the main drives and control systems. To give himself a break from the intense concentration on the airship's repair, he supplements his rations with the occasional hunting trip through the nearby tunnels.

Finally, Davron seals the last conduit and makes his way to the control room. Touching several softly glowing gems in sequence, he studies the flickering on the panel before him, and he nods in satisfaction - though most of the controls are dark, as he expected, the systems he hoped for are all operational. Taking the control yoke, he eases the vessel carefully into the air, sending whirlwinds of dust all about the ancient plaza, and the lumbering craft wallows slightly as it turns back to the southwest. Flocks of birds burst from the treetops as Davron cruises slowly over them, and sing loudly in its wake as he makes his way back to the Circle's landing site.

The trees grow tall and proud fruther east of Rathess. A bit more to the North, the jungle gives way to ancient oaks who've stood for time immemorial. These are trees for whom the petty competition for sunlight and nutrients holds no meaning. Smaller trees tap into their roots and draw strength from them. Sunlight filters through the canopy and into the shaded growth on the ground below. Ramar walks reverently over stones that dream of being mountains, guided by the light as it cascades down, illuminating the path he must take.

His path takes him through an immaculate pool of water, clearer than any crystal that the roots of one of the largest trees drink from. They plunge deep into the Earth, and a soft wind disturbs the leaves gently.... here is a meeting of elements.Ramar kneels down respectfully, addressing the grandfather trees as his Caste Mark shines brightly on his forehead, all but eliminating what light filters through. "I've come bringing news of the Unconquered Sun, and the world of men, come to talk with you. Come to offer to you what blessings I can offer in exchange for knowledge, for the perspective of those whose wisdom is ageless... whose roots were old when the Dragon Kings first walked, and whose roots will linger long after the eyeblink of my existence has passed..."

The tree groans and creaks, as if the wind were growing stronger, making it sway... but there is little movement. The creaks become a voice, low and powerful, that is echoed and edged by the rustling of the wind through leaves. The tree is speaking. And Ramar listens. They talk, mostly introductions, interpretations, establishing the bonds of common ground. Familiarity blooms in the rich soil of the Eclipse's presence, and after some time, Ramar steers the conversation back towards the business at hand. He explains the doings of Ranapura, which is known to the Trees, and of the deliberative, and of his desire to have their wisdom heard upon it's council. "For even though our lives may be mere seasons to you, perhaps for that short time, with your help, we can make the world brighter. And you can help shape things so that even once we have passed on... our great work might linger."

Beneath the boughs of the trees, Ramar waits patiently. He has learned much of waiting during his time in the Wyld, and this helps him here. "You know the secrets of slow power... ancient knowledge... I would offer you the chance to strengthen the cycle of life and death in this place if you will teach me these secrets. I offer you the means to see that the onslaught of the Shadowlands are halted, where and when you will it." He explains what he developed in the Wyld, the effects of his spell and of other boons he might bestow upon the trees, should they ask for them. And as he speaks, he tries to understand what it is these trees seek, the weeks of conversation give him insight as do his Charms.

When he is done he shows them. Essence glitters, hanging in the suddenly still air... at his feet flowers blossom, and the grass grows stronger. Essence flows through his body as he works his sorcery, sealing off the great Trees from the Shadows of the Underworld. And he will teach them such magic, as can be taught, and in the end, will try to learn from them a Name.

---

_For a time, I had considered abandoning speech._ The tree-god's voice rattles within Ramar's mind, a whisper among the wind which blows the branches of a tree. An hour passes.

_I will give you my name. It is the Name of the World Tree whose roots sunder any stone. On whose trunk the ancient Solar Wu-Dan was crucified by the Ebon Dragon. You will find that it is slowly spoken and sprouts with great patience, but there is nothing which can stand against its growth._ Another hour passes.

_The cost is this. In ten years you will show little speech and think inward. In one hundred you will lose speech, showing the world only your deeds. In one thousand you will take root, standing between day and night as a silent icon to justice._

_This geas be upon you._ The tree-god falls silent.

There is a moment in which Ramar considers the prospect of losing all speech and taking root. A moment during which the possibilities unfurl before him all in an instant, or at least what he perceives to be them. A determined look is on his face as he nods, slowly, choosing his words carefully in response to the tree god. "I am honored. Thank you." Then he too falls silent. There's much to think on already, let alone in ten years time.

Helios' might shines above the canopies of the Rathess ruins, glinting off the emerald leaves and the ancient alien structures that peek beneath the latticework of vegetation as the Circle meets once more, having opted for the pavilion where the once-dormant airship had risen from. Some of the Solars, when not having been capturing new Dragon Kings, cleared the plaza of abundant weeds, sculpting it as a proper place for the first re-emergence of once great beings to be honored as they had been before.

Ramar has trudged back to the fortified campsite in Rathess, spirit-seed in tow, and now finds Egress standing in the center of the cleared space. In a semicircle around her, squatting or kneeling or simply sprawled out, are fifteen roughly bipedal, reptilian shapes. All are wielding some sort of largish calligraphy brushes, and each is engaged in their own individual writing project.

One of the creatures, with an elongated neck and exaggerated grace of movement, rises in a sinuous motion and lays its calligraphy brush out beside the paper lying on the ground. It approaches Ramar and inclines its head. Flanges of scaly flesh bristle, and it hisses a greeting or introduction of some kind. It speaks the High Holy Tongue, and only Egress knows its words: _Give me the seed you carry._

In return, Ramar speaks, and Egress translates. _Take this seed, and tend to it carefully. A gift from the East._ He bows his head to the Dragon King and hands over the seed, putting no small amount of importance in this gesture.

Then a strange thing happens. The creature pops the seed into its mouth, swallows - an uncanny gesture, for the length of its throat - and turns. The others, seeing this, rise as one and approach it as it moves toward the center of the clearing. The others begin to batter at it then, punching and kicking and gouging. The clearing rings with the sound of squeals, as the tortured Dragon King is smashed into the dust by its fellows. Then, just as mysteriously, they cease their beatings and turn, to resume their former sitting position. Their wounded comrade lies still, breathing faintly.

There is little Ramar can do but stand and watch helplessly. As he sees the wounded Dragon King lying still, breathing faintly, he looks towards Egress, the silent question of _should I do something_ written plain as day on his face. He dares not speak, for he can almost feel the Name welling up in his throat...

Egress raises a hand to Ramar, a strange, calm smile coming to her lips. She's not brought them this far to doubt in the Dragon Kings. She knows not what is happening, and yet her faith steadies her. She trusts in the wisdom of these children in ways words cannot convey. "All will be as it must be," she says quietly.

Davron lowers the arrow back into its quiver, hardly aware that he had even drawn it. As much of a shock as the assault was, he can only trust in Egress, even as she trusts in her charges.

Time passes as the attackers continue their calligraphy. Little by little the wounded Raptok regains its strength. As it begins to rise, the other Dragon Kings again cease their labors. One speaks, and Egress listens. _Flesh becomes water, wood becomes bone..._ The others join in, chanting in their High Holy Speech, reciting the mantra. The sole Raptok finally rises to its feat, and cocks its head from side to side. The bones within crackle audibly. It repeats this with its claws, then looks about itself. Its eyes settle on Ramar, and he senses the presence of something familiar. "The joining," announces the Raptok, speaking now in Forest-tongue, the language of the East. "Spirit and flesh have fused."

---

Days have passed. The joining of Dragon King and ancient tree-god has taken a simple name: Rowan. And on the day where a trio of Tyrant Lizards storms into Rathess and send the archaeologists scurrying for their camps, the better-concealed Solars gather to hear it explain to Davron the weapon by which the Lizards will be driven back.

"It may still work. It was part of the heart of the _tetsujin_," Rowan explains. "I have seen your modifications. You sacrificed all weapons for flight, a remarkable feat. We claim the right of the hunt, and in doing so I will show you what your ancestors created for us."

None of the Solars raise an objection to this, and so Rowan and one of his fellow Raptok make their way back to the airship hangar. The _olchilik_ lays claim to Davron's tools, and insists that the craftsman observe and help out. "I will show you the deeper layers your cunning men constructed. Layers upon layers of complexity wrapped into something that looked like a child's toy," Rowan says as he works, and Davron cannot immediately discern some of the purposes behind his modifications. Nevertheless everything continues to function as it ought to.

"The _tetsujin_ will function for you as well as it will for us," he says at last, when the work is done. And so saying, the other Raptok boards the airship and takes his position at the helm.

The airship is not large, like a sailing vessel - it is a smaller boat or cutter, several yards in length, with a flat deck and a complex arrangement of pieces. Its hull is not a single solid chunk, but flexible arrangements of armor and trim that seem able to adapt to the shape of the wind.

Now, Davron has a revelatory flash, for the hunter is activating some of the mechanisms aboard the ship. The Essence-charged jewels hum and throb with sudden life, and the whole boat shudders. It begins to remold itself. Pieces change place around the mutable skeleton of the keel. Articulated grips emerge from protective vambraces, and the essential fore-and-aft character of the thing is becoming more and more that of an up-and-down form.

With a final bellow of escaping steam and Essence, the airship has wrapped itself around its pilot. All that stands before Davron and his fellow-architect now is a gleaming Warstrider.

Davron takes a step back, and opens his mouth... and no words come out, for a long moment. Finally, he manages, "Sun Moon, and Stars! Of all the..." Words fail him again, and he can do naught but applaud the skill of his long-dead forebears.

The airship-strider wobbles sharply, before its pilot resumes control. "It will take time to harmonize," Rowan says. "Let us take that time to get to a good vantage point. We will no doubt need repairs after this."

The Solars move to a high tower overlooking the densely-forested area around the building. They can hear the sounds of tree-branches snapping and the pounding footfalls of the Tyrant Lizards, chasing some smaller prey through the woods around them.

A few minutes pass. "He comes now," whispers Rowan, pointing with one claw. Davron has already seen it - a gleaming metal man, hovering over the woods without support. The strider crashes down, knocking trees effortlessly out of its way. The humming noise from its engines can be heard even to the tower, moreso when it begins to crash through the coverage toward the lizards.

The fight, when it actually happens, is surprisingly brief. The first Tyrant Lizard, instinctively sensing a challenge, roars deafeningly and thunders through the trees toward its artificial adversary. The Raptok pilot wastes no time, slamming one of his metal gauntlets into the side of the lizard's face. A few more well-placed attacks to the vital nerve clusters on and around the skull, and the senseless brute crashes to the ground.

The other two charge as well, and the strider takes to the air just as they come close enough to attack. It lands on the back of one, and reaches around the beast's neck. The augmented strength of the Solar Empire's wonderworking is the victor, particularly augmented by the vicious tactics and grim knowledge of its guiding mind. The lizard's neck snaps, leaving the third Lizard to snap its jaws shut just shy of the strider's legs.

Repeated punches to the midriff down the third Lizard, leaving the warstrider standing victorious among the trio. Rowan smiles, revealing rows of white, sharp teeth.
