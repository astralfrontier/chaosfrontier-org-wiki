It has been a time of travel for Ramar. A time for being in the world, guided by little more than some half-remembered instinct that calls to him. The siren song of wanderlust is answered. Besides, it's time to put his newest spell to a practical test. There's an isolated Shadowland off in the South... long-forgotten, scarcely inhabited by the living much less the dead... and it is here that he brings life. Brings the weakening between worlds to an end. And then, just as suddenly as he'd turned up, he vanishes... the Name of Katya Ken whispered as he returns, Ranapura his destination.

---

Ranapura is dark when Ramar returns to it, but as usual, there some who go without much sleep. The ornate building that serves as the office of the Heirophant remains lit into the night, and there Egress stares out to the west, looking across her table and frowning in thought. Before her are no less than a hundred maps of the Blessed Isle. To the right of these a stack of reports on the houses, their arms, their dispositions, and their economic conditions. Everyone knows that Egress has been more distracted as of late. Something is clearly drawing her mind away from her usual obligations.

"Is everything alright m'love?" It's a voice that seems to come out of thin air. Ramar is the source of this voice, though it takes a moment to pick him out of the darkness. He steps into view and lays a hand on Egress' shoulder. "You look as though you've got the weight of the world on your shoulders... what's on your mind?"

"The Scarlet Throne," says Egress. She looks back to Ramar and sighs, "I am afraid that it's in my heart that no Dragon Blood should claim it." She looks back to the west. "It is in my heart that I should find a way to set myself upon it. I do not yet know how. There are so many difficulties. If it would be managed, though... we would be able to effectively guide the greatest power in Creation. Almost all the Chosen would stand under one banner." She has a distant expression, as if she were picturing this in her mind. "And yet I can't see how to do this effectively. Certainly the Lunars will triumph eventually over the Dragon Blooded, but.. in the end the Isle will be torn apart. I want something faster, far less bloody."

"Something that leaves the Realm intact to face the enemies of Creation," Davron agrees, sighing. "But I know of no device that would wipe out the prejudice against the Anathema. Nor would I trust it, if I did."

Davron looks back to the reports he was poring over, trying to approach the matters of empire as an engineering problem, as is his wont. Thus far, he's had no more success with this approach than Egress has had with hers.

"No device save time and our actions," agrees Ramar. He sighs thoughtfully, "The thing is... while we may be able to take the throne fast and bloodlessly... keeping it might be another matter entirely. It seems to me that none must be able to deny that you are the one to sit upon the Scarlet Throne. I've been speaking with spirits... old gods in distant lands, asking if they would have their voices heard, perhaps if their voices were heard again, with the voices of Heaven behind them, more will listen. It will take more than this... but it may be a good beginning."

"The gods.." Egress looks lost in thought again, then nods slowly. "That would be a very good place to start. Their assistance might be just the thing to give me the push I need to figure answer this question." She stretches, reaching up to run a hand through her hair. "I know I can sway the people. My influence is already reaching the Blessed Isle. There are stories moving through the streets. Though they are couched in falsehoods, I have found a way to project the truth through them. Even the deceits of our enemies can be used against them. The problem is, this approach is slow, and though it sets the stage for our work, it does not bring about the change on its own."

"Yes. I understand this Egress... but for now, it seems all we can do is set the stage for our work. And do what we can to reduce the bloodshed. It is something I have learned... if we are to grow mighty, our roots must go deep. Roots such as these which set our stage for us." Ramar speaks softly, mind racing, "I wish I could come up with something better for you. Perhaps we shall see what can be done to bring about the change... perhaps in setting the stage we will find our script."

"No," answers Egress. "We can do more." She rises smoothly, "I think I know what we must do." She narrows her eyes, "It is time we settled with another Death Lord. This time, we will do it with the officials of the Realm on-hand to see what the real Deliberative is capable of. The question is simply who we wish to lay low. Mask of Winters said he would stand aside for now. I think it is time we remove another from the picture. That is the beginning I need."

"Very well then... if this is what we must do... I will go with you. Ride against the Deathlord at your side." There is a far off expression in Ramar's eyes, "I nearly lost you once... I'll not do so again. Who else would go to do such a thing, though?"

"Mai Bo," answers Egress. "And I do not mean to ride off alone. The Deliberative was not formed so that our circle would face every challenge on our own. We will be using far more than just our powers. It is time to bring the strength of that which we have built to bear against our enemies. It is time to strike back at the Deathlords. This time, we will show them what the future has in store for their kind. I believe, Ramar, that there are many things we can do to disrupt the Shadowlands. Without those places to gather power in, any Deathlord that stands against us will find out how serious a miscalculation they have made."

"Indeed..." Ramar chuckles, "And it is easier to disrupt the Shadowlands now than you might think... this new spell can help contain them... enough so that we can find a way to ultimately banish them."

"I need you to call Black Ice Shadow to me," says Egress. "I will not rest until I've spoken with him. He has information that will be crucial to our plans. This time we will win the battle, but we shall need guidance. I trust the power of Denandsor and Ranapura both will be tapped to the fullest to win this war, Davron. I know you will rise to the occasion. There is much to be done." She looks to Ramar then, "I trust you have something special you can prepare, as well?"

"Yes... though... I am beholden to it." It is then that Ramar divulges what occured in the deep forests of the East, with the Ancient Trees. About the Name he'd learned and the Geas he is now under.

That Geas seems to not sit well with Egress. She sighs quietly and looks again to the west. "It is the way of things. Our obligations are greater than that of others. Our sacrifices are naturally going to be far more than we originally could have imagined. I only hope that this magic is worth that binding." She taps her fingers over the desk, waiting for the Sidereal to be summoned. It seems that her mind is utterly focused. She knows part of her plan. The details are still clicking into place.

"You rang." Black Ice Shadow's voice slides down the spine like a cold knife. The man himself does not appear anywhere, and his disembodied reply is all the more eerie for it.

"The farspeaking system from Denandsor has been repaired, Davron. This I am instructed to tell you." The Sidereal's directionless voice continues. "You may call for me from anywhere within the city."

Ramar looks around with the unease of one not quite used to these things... "I don't think I'll ever be used to that..."

"Timely as always," says Egress. She doesn't bother to look. It's not as if seeing Black Ice Shadow's gaunt figure was ever that pleasant. Somehow, though, this is more strange than normal. "I wish to smash one of the Deathlords from Creation to demonstrate the true direction of the new Deliberative to those on the Blessed Isle. I am considering the Scarlet Throne very carefully. I seek advice on which Deathlord to start against and what I must do to secure the support of the Sidereals."

Black Ice Shadow does not hesitate long before answering. He has considered this matter, it seems. "The Bishop. An unpopular and rather mad Deathlord, even by the standards of those.. people. Consolidate your hold on the North in the process."

"Then the Bishop is our target," says Egress. "I want to see him flattened. I'll send word to the Bull of the North and all the Lunars that walk in those lands. The Deliberative has been roused. We are going to war." She narrows her eyes and goes on, "I will need Yana's help. Or perhaps the Sidereals are more suited to another task. I wish to demonstrate our power and will to the Realm with this battle. If I were to take, say, forty officials from the Realm to show the truth to, who would the Sidereals advise? Also, can the Sidereals see to it that they are taken quietly without too much disruption?"

"Such an operation is .. not my domain. I refer you to the Priestess." Black Ice Shadow's voice holds a note of anticipation. Perhaps eagerness.

"Well, can this system reach her?" asks Egress. She hasn't a clue how it works, of course. "I'm rather accustomed to Sidereals simply appearing when they are most useful, I'm afraid. The Master got me quite accustomed to such timely arrivals." She sighs quietly, trying to recall when she last spoke with the Master. It seems so very long ago, somehow.

"I am here, Egress," the Priestess' voice says, joining in. "Tell me your wish."

"I wish to sit upon the Scarlet Throne," says Egress. "I wish that the Realm be brought back its rightful rulers, and restored in this time of turmoil. Creation needs it to be strong. The Dragon Blooded are divided. They are weakening. I have seen first hand how swiftly they grow when they are near the Celestials. They know in their souls that they belong with us. I simply need to know who among them can best spread this feeling. Who should I reveal myself to?"

"Mnemon will accept no Empress but herself. You have already allied with some in House Ragara." The Priestess hums audibly. "If you are a student of the Isle's history, you know of the downfall of House Iselsi. It is rumored that some of that House still walk the island as spies. There have been many purges, but.. if any of them are still alive, they would be the perfect shadow. Allow me time to divine a more proper answer, and I will speak with you then."

"Thank you," answers Egress. "I think we have a beginning.. and I always wondered about the fate of House Iselsi. The Empress was shrewd to let some of them remain. And now those remnants would be very useful, indeed." She looks over the maps and muses aloud, "I think Mnemon will soon have to be undone. Still, all things in time, however. They will have to stand for a little while longer before they can finally be swept away. However, it shall not be my hand that lays her low. My prediction is that she shall die by the hands of her own House, in the end."
