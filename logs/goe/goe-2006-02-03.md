# Gods of Eden 2006-02-03

The Circle has been busy, and Ramar is no exception. Though as of late, much of his time has been spent reviewing the Books for tales of the old Deliberative, and how its presence was made known. He finds a few descriptions here and there of the old ornaments of office... particularly those worn by the Hierophant. _The Ring of the Deliberative._ And so it is to Yu-Shan that Ramar travels, in search of Madame Marthesine of the Lost and the Ring.

"Summon the Wyld Hunters for me."

It is often the way that such short phrases can alter the very course of history. Egress speaks them knowing full well that she is setting a course that risks everything. She is focused and more confident than she's ever been. The Priestess wears a small smile, murmuring, "It truly begins, now."

And so it does. The Wyld Hunters come swiftly, visiting Ranapura with eyes wide. Egress greets them politely, but she greets them politely from a high seat that was arranged for her to give audiences. While before she met them as allies, there is a definite difference. She has grown greatly in power while they remain much the same. Yet, she is polite to them, inquiring about their families, if they have seen all they desire in the Nation of the Sun, and even inviting them to explore Ranapura with one of the Dragon Blooded engineers who assist Davron in keeping the city functioning.

Egress did not summon the Wyld Hunters just to chat politely, however. She has a request of them. It is a most serious request. She wishes them to speak with the leaders of the houses of Ledaal, Nellens, Ragara, V'neef, and Cathak and call their representatives to her. The purpose of this invitation is left vague. Egress simply says she wishes to improve relations. It is of no relevance, so long as they come to see what they must see.

And so they do. From House Cathak comes Captain Cathak Ranas, a proud, stern man. From House Ledaal comes Ledaal Ricot, a man of great potential but marked with a most unfortunate (in his family's eyes) craving for adventure. Ragara Felis and his younger bride Peleps Magaret come to represent the interests of their House, one with a most clever and practical eye, the other seeing things beyond the present. House V'neef sends a young, powerful personality in V'neef Aliset, sister of V'neef herself. She is the most unafraid to openly admire the impressive work of the Solars, for every stop along the way has revealed their power. House Nellens sends four representatives, two of which are mortals, and two are Dragon-Blooded. A final party is represented by just one person. Their gender is impossible to say, but the voice seems to be that of a woman, who gives the name Falling Dagger.

The meeting takes place in Bridal Veil, where the one-time home of a tyrant has been rebuilt to the point of being utterly unrecognizable. Though the point is never made openly, it is clear that Egress is elevated above those sent to her. She is respectful to them, and polite, but in the way she meets their eyes, in the gestures she uses and the words she's chosen, it is clear that she is in charge. Command and power radiates from her like heat off a blazing iron.

The audience is not a short one. Egress speaks well into the night on the tragedy of the Realm's current situation. She says nothing they do not know for fact, but she gives it an undertone of sadness that even the greatest of the Realm's bards would be hard pressed to match. The loss of purpose is foremost in her thoughts, but she also speaks of the waste of heroism and the waning of glory and knowledge. It does not change things, but it reveals that Egress has her mind on the Blessed Isle.

After the guests are given a proper feast and a comfortable rest, they are shown about the Nation of the Sun. There are many points of interest to those who come, and Egress' attention to detail is obvious. Cathak Ranas is paired with General Dace, who shows the man the current campaigns underway, as well as drilling grounds and the military academies that have sprung up all over the Nation. Ranas sees that Dragon Blooded are among those in the armies. He sees that the soldiers are extremely well prepared. He learns that they are men and women of pride and purpose. They are not just martially skilled, but are educated and affluent. The training goes beyond the blade and the march. They tend their weapons well and serve as enforcement of the law, maintaining order and peace. The captain can already see in his mind the speed at which this army could be set into motion. He can see that the stores are ready. He knows an army on the brink of war when he sees it.

The representatives of House Nellens are most interested in the orderly manner in which farming is done in the Nation. The rotation of crops, the coordination of harvests, and the careful guidance of prayers and offerings to ensure timely rains and good weather all fascinate them. The efficiency of workers in textiles and the fair way in which they are treated surprises them. They have an eye for those things that others miss. They learn of the extremely high reputation of Egress and the Solars in the eyes of the common folk. They see the truth. The Nation of the Sun is a powerhouse, but its future is far, far greater still. They can only estimate that in a decade, it will be one of the richest countries in all of Creation.

Ledaal Ricot and his retainers are guided by Cloudburst. She shows them the great library and explains to them the school system that is taking shape in the Nation of the Sun. The concept of free education for all is something they have not seen before. They meet the young students, they inspect the classrooms. They also meet teachers of varying skill and talent. What is evident among them all is a desire to share knowledge. They are teaching because they truly love it, and that fire has been inspired many times by the speeches of their queen.

Ragara Felis and his bride Peleps Magaret are shown the plans for new trade lines. They are told about the automatons that the Nation wishes to use to replace slavery forever. They see how this would help them smash the power of Cynis, they can already imagine the influence that such a trade could bring. There can be no doubt that the Solars have grown very great, indeed. There is both a promise and a threat. For one who deals with them now, there can be incredible profit. Those who wait until later may do far more poorly. Even the distant, strange eyes of Magaret see it clearly. "There is a change in the water here," she says quietly, "And soon the dam that holds it fast shall fail utterly."

Egress takes an immediate liking to V'neef Aliset, and guides her personally. The young woman is strong, impulsive, and very willful. She is the first to be shown Ranapura, and the first to really be shown the private side of Egress. She meets Jin-nu, Rain of Fire, and Sanith and is flown about the Nation of the Sun. Aliset speaks for many hours with the Dragon Kings that visit Ranapura, as well as the pterok who is rebuilding a corner of the great flying city to fit the needs of his own people. What she is shown is a cosmopolitan power that already is a threat to the Realm. Hearing of the alliances and the scope of the Deliberative's reach, it seems beyond containing. Soon, what is growing here shall be every bit the equal of the Realm. With the sea shielding the east from the Realm's powerbase, and the great forces of Ma-Ha-Suchi and his allies waiting to strike, it would be very optimistic to think this new power can be easily brought to heel.

The secretive guest is welcomed and given a guide when asked. However, Falling Dagger seems to have little liking for guides. Whatever this odd visitor desires, it seems to not be company. Still, there are some who can tail even the most secretive, and often Falling Dagger finds herself in the company of a curious man who is notoriously skilled at avoiding notice. Even the greatest of spies finds it difficult to best the allies of the Celestial Deliberative. There is no doubt that the slippery nature of the Solar spies are every bit a match for even this masterful guest. The message is very clear.

The visitors are again gathered, but this time they are all summoned to Ranapura. They leave bearing gifts. V'neef Aliset has many, for Egress clearly likes her and has high hopes that this young woman will give her a fair hearing. She need not worry, however. Among the well treated retainers of House V'neef is V'neef herself. This illusion is allowed to persist to the end, for V'neef is given the honor of the last farewell from the Heirophant. Egress speaks quietly, "It was an honor to have such guests come so very far. I am very pleased to know that house V'neef sends not just the granddaughter of V'neef, but the Lady herself. When the time comes, perhaps we might meet in earnest. Sadly, that time is not now. Go in peace. I shall send word soon for another meeting."

Though Davron has been Exalted above mortal men, he has seen the wrong end of slavery - in his friends and relatives if perhaps not in himself. Ever since he began to realize the full extent of his power, he has sought to abolish it. And yet, slavery is a well-established institution in the world. Creation is full of tasks that civilizations depend on for their survival, yet are so grueling or mindless that almost no man or woman would do it willingly. And too, there are tasks that the rich and powerful _desire_ to be done for them, and will coerce weaker men or women to do those things.

Davron himself is not well suited to bring an end to the latter form of slavery - that is a matter of curbing the desires of the powerful by persuasion or force. However, the necessary slavery, that which is imposed on people out of need and not want... that is a problem which lends itself to Davron's peculiar talents.

The myriad automata which aided Davron in the construction of Ranapura form his starting point. They themselves will not serve well as the mechanical slaves he seeks - they are too specialized in their nature, too bound to himself, too fragile, and, when it comes down to it, too _expensive_, in both construction and maintenance; but the principles behind their construction may serve his needs, and of course the miniature golden beings will aid him in his construction of a slave-factory, as they have aided him so many times before.

The design for the bodies is simple enough. The basic automaton will be humanoid in form, have eyes of crystal, flesh of clay, skin of cloth and leather, and bones of wood. All these things can be obtained readily and in bulk; though exactly which grade of cloth, or what type of wood, will depend on the intended function of the machine. Automata meant for hard labor will be built of tough rawhide, canvas, and hardwoods, possibly even ironwood if the customer truly needs that level of strength and durability. Pleasure automata, meanwhile, will have bones of pine or willow, and skin of fine silk and suede, magically enhanced to look and feel like human flesh.

A labor automaton needs more than just a body, though; it needs the basic knowledge of the task it will be applied to. Since Davron's purpose is to create laborers that do not have the human capacity to be oppressed, he cannot give them the fully human capacity for learning; instead, he will give the laborers the ability to learn by rote. To accomplish this, he will draw the essential Essence of mimicry from non-human or even non-living things that have it in their nature to copy what they observe: parrots mimic human voices, monkeys are proverbial for aping what they see, mirrors reflect an image of what is seen in them.

Davron observes flocks of birds, and schools of fish, and captures and experiments upon them to determine what in their nature induces them to mimic one another's actions. He even seeks out a valley in the mountains renowned for its echo, and painstakingly charts its dimensions, then spends long and late hours computing complicated sums and differences and ratios of those dimensions until he finds the precise set of figures that summarize an echo canyon's tendency to echo. These will determine the size and dimensions of the 'brain' casing.

All these things, however, merely make it _possible_ for the automaton to do what it needs to do. The final piece of the puzzle is the automaton's will: the force that will drive it to serve willingly, loyally, even enthusiastically. Here Davron faces a dilemma, for once again he is reluctant to derive this will from a human source. Even the most loyal of men has his own agenda, his own desires, and men do not freely transfer their loyalty; the Copper Spider fears that if he creates automata in this fashion, he will have created, not mechanical slaves, but another race of _people_, which will desire and deserve freedom in their own right.

Trying to resolve this dilemma, Davron decides to take a break from cogitation, to walk or ride where the whim strikes him, to observe the world and let its inspirations enter his mind. On his course, he observes a pasture, where a flock of sheep is grazing. He watches them for a while, and is about to go on his way, when the shepherd, deciding that it is time to call the herd in, sends out his sheepdog. Davron watches the dog as it dashes eagerly around the flock, urging them back down the hillside, and it occurs to him: _Dogs! They are obedient, loyal to men, eager to please. That is the nature I require of the automata._ He hurriedly makes ready to return to Ranapura, to determine how to accomplish this.

Quickly he comes to realize that, while mere distilling of Essence was enough to form the template for the automata's behavior, instilling a living _will_ into their bodies requires something more fundamental - some way to incorporate a bit of the very nature of Dog into them. And the only way to obtain something of that sort will be from the spirit which embodies the nature of Dog: the Dog's animal avatar.

Out in the wild forests of the Northeast, beyond Halta and the semi-civilized lands of the barbarians, the older creatures of Creation still sometimes roam. In a forest clearing, Davron sits at a fire. The sun has sunk beneath the treeline, and in the twilight silences the creatures of the night-forest can be heard stirring.

The little fire provides a tepid illumination at best, the same weak shield against fear that man has always used. It cannot dispel the stirring sense of unease that Davron instinctively feels when staring into the darkness of the cold forest. He feels alone. This is as it should be, for this is how man met one of his strongest allies.

Davron's keen eyes catch a flash of movement in the woods. Minutes pass. From another direction, he receives another brief glimpse of something. Strips of meat lie on a leather mat beside him, and he uses a stick to begin roasting one strip over the little fire. The smokey smell rises into the air of dusk.

In time, the act has its desired effect. Davron can feel it before he can see it - a faint tremor in the ground, followed by another. The trembling earth is being padded on by four enormous feet. From the darkness a face emerges - a muzzle as large as Davron's own torso, framed by two large, glistening eyes. The mouth hangs open, revealing ferociously sharp teeth. The canine cast of the face is unmistakeable, and as the creature heaves itself out into the light of the campfire, Davron recognizes what has come. This is Dog.

Davron stands, offering Dog the roasted meat, all in accordance with the ancient ritual. "Hello, friend," he says. "I come as a representative of Man, to make a request of you."

The thunderous paws halt in front of the fire, and the gigantic animal - easily taller at the shoulder than Davron at his full height - settles down into a crouch, regarding him. Although his panting breath does not cease, words come, and Davron feels them in his heart as well as hearing them with his ears. Dog's voice is deep as the earth, somehow mournful and melancholy.

"Man, you are. Speak, and share meat."

Davron tosses the Dog the great strip of meat, and begins to roast another. "Your kin have served Man well for centuries beyond mortal reckoning, Dog," he says. "I come now to request a new form of service. I am constructing mechanical beings that will take the place of human servants, and I wish to instill in these creatures a willingness to serve with enthusiasm. It is the will of the Dog that I deem most fit for this purpose. Will you help me?"

"We did not serve." Dog wolfs down the meat quickly, and the sound of teeth grinding is uncomfortably loud. "Not at first. We were hunters together. You have changed."

Davron nods slowly, staring into the fire. "We _have_ changed," he says contemplatively. "We settled down, and began to build cities. There are those who still remember the hunt as it was in the old days, though they have been pushed to the fringes." Right now, Davron feels uncomfortably civilized. "Do you prefer the old ways, then?"

"It was as it was. It is as it is. Memories...all that's left." Dog spits out a lump of gristle. "I am more forgiving than my brother." Davron can guess what creature he refers to: the fanged hunter of the wildlands, the wolf. "If I give you this, what will you do?"

Davron looks up into Dog's great brown eyes. "I will make machines for doing work that suits man's form but not man's nature. Tasks that need the versatility of a man's shape, but clash with a man's constant desire to become more than what he is."

"You..." Dog looks back, staring at Davron with unnerving intensity. "You have the same spirit. The same heart. You are like the first man who came. You ask." The great creature pauses, and its lumbering bulk shifts, sending shivers through the ground. "Cut my flesh. Take blood from the wound. It will hold what you seek."

Davron draws a knife from its sheath, and a vial from a pouch. "I thank you, friend Dog," he says, carefully drawing the blade across its great hide - the steaming red blood seems to glow in the light of the fire as it fills the vial, and then Davron presses a heavy clean cloth upon the wound. "And what is it that _you_ seek?"

Dog pants, sounding more weary for the loss of blood. "Give me blood as well. We will make our pact as was done before."

Davron nods. It is fitting in many ways; not only a blood oath, but Man providing for Dog just as Dog provides for Man. Davron grits his teeth as he draws the razor-sharp blade along his arm, and offers the dripping limb to the creature's muzzle.

The Dog laps at Davron's wound, and the Exalt can feel the avatar draw upon his Essence. When it has had its fill, Davron wraps his arm in a bandage, and gently rests a hand upon its flank. "Run swiftly, Dog," he says. "And thank you again." And with that, Davron walks into the forest, to return to the world of cities once more.
