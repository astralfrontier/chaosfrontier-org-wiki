# Gods of Eden 2006-02-10

The meeting with the Realm representatives has had a most profound effect on the hopes of Egress. They also gained a lot of attention from Lookshy. Egress had told them representatives would come to see the Nation of the Sun, and she has told them that another invitation is being given to her 'friends from the west' to see the city of Ranapura with their own eyes. Naturally, such a monumental visit requires a large entourage. In this case, it is nothing short of an army that Egress wishes to invite, but she will do so only with the blessing of Lookshy. It would hardly seem correct to have such important guests visit from so very far away without also inviting this most important ally that is nearby.

The invitations are not really invitations at all. They are simply the exerting of influence the likes of which has not been seen in ages. The tales carried back to the leaders are charged with the powerful presence of the Heirophant. Respect is demanded, and the admiration of such an incredibly successful woman is enflamed. They may turn away, but when they do, they feel how difficult it is. There is a power in her that reaches all the way across Creation to touch them. These 'anathema' have grown very powerful, indeed. More powerful than the Wyld Hunt has faced in a very long time.

There is only one choice. The powers of the Realm must confront this unchecked force that is growing mighty in the east. The Leaders of the Houses must see for themselves what this other Deliberative is doing. They send warnings to Egress that they shall come to visit, and are shocker when her terms are set so simply in return. No house may bring more soldiers than another. No house may bring more than forty people to the city of Ranapura itself, and no army may camp closer than twenty miles. The Realm Forces are to stay away from the camps of Lookshy, and will come with the permission of Lookshy and the blessing of the Heirophant.

This time, there is no holding back. It was the young V'neef who demanded that this dangerous venture take place, and so she was the first to say she would come, the first to say she was not going to hide from one of the Anathema. Ragara is blissfully retired, but he still has influence, and his son Benoba, leader of the House, has come at his urging. Ragara was often listening to the tales of the Nation of the Sun's great wealth, and while he may not be involved in the politics of the house anymore, he certainly would enjoy seeing Ragara grow more powerful still.

Cathak Cainan comes as well. His fiery temper demanding that his house have its place of honor in any meeting with the cursed anathema. Yet even in his dreams the thoughts of military glory find their home. He often sees a new banner, one that is fearlessly raised against foes in a way the Realm has not done in centuries. He can envision the power of the armies, and he sees a place of glory there. Yet he fights down such a heretical impulse.

From House Ledaal comes Ledaal Kebok Omeger, Ledaal Catala Gamam, Ledaal Caros, and Ledaal Cycel, who guide it in tandem. For some, this journey is surprisingly short. Ledaal Catala Gamam has been actively hunting for information concerning the Deathlords throughout the Threshold, and she comes eagerly, for in her heart blossoms a hope that these Solars, these suppose anathema, are the true answer to the darkness that is gathering in Creation. She is the true fire in her House. It is her mind that is the most open, but she is not the only one who comes with hope. For some it is more personal. Ledaal Caros only hopes that he might finally be free to live the life of his choosing, rather than that forced upon him.

House Nellens sends the group of seven members that lead it to see this distant power. The patricians are suspicious, and the Dragon Blooded are concerned that they will be easily over awed by the Anethema. Egress is careful to only send them suggestions of prosperity, while focusing her true power on the exalted themselves. They cannot help but focus on the way mortals are treated in the Nation of the Sun. There is no disgrace in not being an exalt. There is an honor in all things, and all people have value. It is not that the Realm thinks mortals worthless, it is that the anathema treasure them so very much that is both surprising and quite encouraging.

On the strong suggest of V'neef Aliset, Tepet Darik urges his house to take action as well. Though the response is not a strong one at first, the knowledge that so many other houses are sending forces inspires a certain hunger for battle glory about those in Tepet. Tepet Ejava comes to lead the forces of her house, Tepet Locus comes as well, hoping to prove his worth to his family and perhaps to mark himself as a more desirable match for Ledaal Sirel, whom he loves, and finally Tepet Deramol Kelles has come for her own, private reasons. Her's is the heart of an abolotionist, and she has heard the very loud murmurings that this new power not only seeks to stop slavery, but has already made huge strides against the practice.

As a final touch, Egress finds herself walking one of Ranapura's corridors in preparation for the conference, only to be greeted by a messenger. Although the wind-blown words the city provides are a useful form of communication, correspondence is still brought in the traditional fashion - by letter. The messenger, a youth with curly dark hair whom the Solar recognizes as from the Nation, presents her with an envelope. Inside is a slip of paper, and Egress recognizes the sigil which has been marked on it with charcoal: the emblem of House Iselsi, the invisible, the fallen. The messenger allows his boyish mask to slip, revealing for a moment a stirring of the eyes which suggests unplumbed depths of emotion. The moment passes; the messenger makes to depart, bowing deeply beforehand.

Egress knows the meaning of that mark very well, and to know that it has come to her here moves her deeply. "I am most honored," she says, nodding her head respectfully. "House Iselsi, too, comes with all honor to Ranapura. They shall be welcomed to our table, and they may remain unannounced if they wish." She knows that House Iselsi must be met with all due discretion. For their own safety.

The sad smile of the departing youth needs no words - _there is no House Iselsi now_.

Egress watches quietly and smiles sadly in turn. "My voice has sung trees more dead than this to life again," she whispers quietly.

The rulers of the Great Houses have not come alone. In an unprecedented move, Lookshy has agreed to treat the landing of Realm troops on the shores of the Threshold as a demonstration of force, not an act of war. The client-states of the Realm have marshalled their forces as well, joining them in alliance with the Imperial heavy footsoldiers who march in perfect columns off their barges. A vast panoply has surrounded the region of Denandsor, once the Empty City, now clearly the nexus of activity in the region. Egress well knows that if anything should happen to the members of the Great Houses, a war for possession of Denandsor will begin. She must protect the heads not only from the more paranoid gens of Lookshy, but also from each other.

In addition to the haughty Terrestrials of the Blessed Isle, the grimly militaristic soldiers of Lookshy - guardians of the East, protectors of the last remnants of the First Age - have sent their own emissaries to take part in the proceedings. Egress knows this move to be political and dangerous, but she recognizes the motives behind the politicians' acts. They seek the preservation of Lookshy, but also the River Province with it. When Lookshy falls, so do the Scavenger Lands. This has been truth for seven hundred years. It will not change easily.

Miles outside of Denandsor's border are thousands of tents. Soldiers from two dozen nations, some of which do not even speak a common language with their commanders, lacquer their spears and clean mold from the leather hide of their shields. Others polish swords and axes, or inspect each others' steel armor and silk trimmings. The Imperial elite forces bide their time quietly, paying well for the brothels upriver to deliver boatloads of giggling girls and sending them home fat of purse, and occasionally of belly.

And beyond the sea of tents and their flying flags, flocks of ravens stare from blood-red eyes at the scene before taking wing to report back to their undead masters. For such a gathering has not gone unnoticed by any power in the East.

This alignment of so many rival forces has turned the city into the most dangerous place in all of Creation. Egress knows her guests very well. She has studied their interests, she has spoken to their friends, and she has tried to root out every useful bit of information concerning every one of them, even down to the foods they like. No detail has been overlooked. There can be no mistakes.

---

The Dynasts and their entourages arrive at the closed Southern Gate of Denandsor, and announce their presence; but it is not the great doors of metal and stone that open. Rather, the air in front of the gate glitters, as if floating wisps of dust are caught in a sunbeam - except that the glimmering motes grow and orbit one another, and suddenly rush together, forming an immense archway of swirling, opalescent light. And at the base of the archway, eleven human silhouettes appear, shadowed against the light.

As eyes become accustomed to the glare of the portal, the figures turn out to be a tall light-haired man, resplendent in his golden armor and bow slung across his back, and with a glittering golden owl perched upon his shoulder; the man is flanked by ten bald, dark-skinned, and heavily built figures; at first glance, they appear human, but not only are their features precisely identical, but they step forward in perfect synchrony with their apparent master, and there is a _mechanical_ look to their features and their movements. The man bows respectfully to the gathered scions of the Realm, and the ten mechanical figures follow suit. "Welcome, my lords and ladies, to the Gates of Ranapura," says the archer. "I am called Davron, and I shall be your guide through the Golden City. These are some of my Laborers," he adds, gesturing to his silent companions. "If you will accompany me..."

The Realm's emissaries emerge upon a wide semicircular balcony overlooking Denandsor - an impressive view in its own right, even if the First Age urban landscape below still merits the name of Empty City. They turn, as the gateway of light dims and fades behind them, to see that the balcony is mounted at the base of a polished granite wall emerging from the ragged stone that forms the underside of Ranapura. Davron pulls a lever mounted at the inside edge of the balcony, and with naught but the slightest whisper of stone against stone, the entire balcony begins to _move_, upward and sideways - and it is at this point that the Dynasts notice the deep groove carved into the mirror-smooth cliff face, leading up and around into a dark tunnel. The balcony passes into the tunnel, lit by glowing white panels. The motion of the balcony is so smooth that only the passing lights provide a sensation of movement - and then the balcony emerges into the sunlight once more.

The vista that appears before the Dragon-Blooded lords as the great balcony rests in place is nothing short of astonishing, even to those who have dwelt in the latter-day height of the Second Age. Ranapura still has not yet fully regained its former glory - that will be the work of years. But the efforts of Davron's automata, both the tiny golden Artisans and the first production run of the clay-and-leather Laborers have reminded Ranapura that it was a First Age city, and that its day has come once again.

Sunlight sparkles as it caresses the rounded domes and tall spires of Ranapura, and the brilliant white walls cast their glow upon verdant gardens below, where the greenery is interspersed with tiny crimson flowers. Glittering ramps of alabaster spiral above the surface streets and between the buildings, and gondolas glide smoothly beneath them, carrying people and goods and Laborers from one place to another. And directly in front of the balcony, an enormous man-made lake, with fountains cascading tens of stories into the sky, the falling water forming rainbows in the sunlight. As the men and women of the Realm look over the balcony, they see that the balcony is now perched on an outcrop above a vast reflecting pool - and they can see that the base of the balcony is carved into the form of a pair of stone hands, cradling the visitors in a shallow bowl.

All this is dwarfed, however, by the central spire. Looking as much as anything else like a volcano emerging from the center of the floating island, it towers above the white buildings of Ranapura, its sides rugged like those of a natural mountain - but the enormous white orb embedded in the side, appearing hundreds of yards wide, is clearly the work of man. The Eye of Ranapura looks out to the southwest, the great blue iris glowing and sparkling faintly in the sunlight, and merely to look upon it conveys the intense impression that it is _watching over_ the city.

A soft chime sounds behind the emissaries, and they see that as they were looking out over the city, the doorway behind them has silently slid upward into the wall. Beyond is a concourse and vault, open to the sky on either end, with two of the white rails that interweave the city running along the ceiling. A gondola is already waiting, like a train of several Guild caravan wagons strung together and attached end to end, all dangling from the rail above. The doors of the sky-train are open, and Marina and the Priestess are already waiting.

The guests are welcomed by name, for Marina and the Priestess know those coming. They ask questions about the welfare of their families, their trades, and the various interests that they know each has. Though the trip is not a long one, there are none who do not converse at least for a time with one or the other.

The interior of the sky-train is lavishly decorated, the carpeting a lush reddish-violet and the walls decorated with precious stones. Even for Ranapura, this vehicle is clearly special, as befits its highborne passengers. Davron and his golem entourage come aboard, and he instructs the Laborers to close the doors behind them. Leaving Marina and the Priestess to talk among the guests, he takes up the controls, and the train begins to glide out of the concourse, moving slowly at first, then picking up speed. Though there is never a lurch, or even an unexpected jolt, the train is soon winding its way through the forest of white buildings - its progress seeming slow until it passes through another concourse, which blurs by in the space of a heartbeat, drawing a gasp of surprise from those passengers who happened to be looking out the window at the time.

Soon the train emerges from the city proper and is spiraling up the side of the central spire, giving its passengers a panoramic view of all of Ranapura and the distant plains beyond. Eventually the train slows and stops, coming to rest at the edge of an open-air pavilion beneath the Great Eye. Wisps of white clouds wreath the sides of the mountain here, with a permanent formation, like a fog-bank, resting on the cliff face above the pavilion. A gentle rain falls from the billowing clouds, sparkling in the sun and pouring into a marble-tiled channel below. Davron clasps his hands together, and then raises them to either side - and the clouds part, revealing a white doorway with the emblem of a great gear embossed on the face. Slowly the doorway opens outward from the top, like a drawbridge, until it rests upon the pavilion and bridges the marble-lined moat.

Beyond the doorway is a high-arched hallway, leading to a vast amphitheater, its roof curving away above toward two enormous chandeliers of crystal and gold, light wells channeling sunlight down to the chandeliers and setting them afire with glittering rainbows. Rows upon rows of balconies curve down along the basin, avenues of red-carpeted steps leading along them. At the back of the assembly hall, a broad gap in the wall reveals a complicated mass of golden gears, rotating at varying speeds - part of the driving machinery of Ranapura itself. And at the center of the room, a podium on a circular platform rising above the lush balconies, the focal point of the entire hall. And beside the dais stands Egress, the Heirophant of the Second Deliberative.

Egress' voice reaches them easily, the hall designed to make those at the dais easily heard. "Welcome, honored guests," she says. "It is an honor to receive you, Lords of the Realm. Please, enter and be welcome. I imagine you have many questions, and I will answer them to the best of my abilities." She ascends the dais and settles herself only after all the guests have arranged themselves. "The first question, of course, is why I have sought the attention of the Realm. I know the leaders of Lookshy have also wondered exactly what my goals are, as well."

"The power of Order and Justice is growing strong," says Egress. "Though you call us anathema, you have heard from your own trusted representatives report the things they have seen. You will be shown that whatever is required as well, of course, to convince you that we are not the dreaded nightmares of legend. For now, however, the direct answer. Though we grow stronger, the Deathlords grow stronger still. Worse yet, there are enemies that have only recently been revealed who seek to undo all that we would stand for." She waits for a moment and goes on, "Yes, I say 'we', for though you would kill my kind without pause, we face the same enemies. Above all, what I must prevent is the annihilation of Creation itself. If the Realm and the Second Deliberative are at odds, we will fall."

There is no muttering, no sound of dissent. There are some looks between those gathered here, and those from Lookshy look particularly uncomfortable. They hardly want an alliance that reaches right across their territory. Egress is hardly unaware of their discomfort. "There are others who have fought hard and long for these things, though. Our close friends from Lookshy are worthy of honor as well, and so I eagerly receive them as well. In this room I have gathered those I believe most willing to hear my words. I believe that you have come because you want to believe. None of us seeks quite the same thing, but we all hope for a great future for our people."

Egress looks at those assembled, seeing them truly for the first time.

Through her time on the Blessed Isle in disguise, she sees the scared, shy girl thrust to the fore because of her blood-heritage. She sees the rape of innocence, the premature sophistication of power. She sees the haughty boy whose crimes were covered up for him until he ceased to recognize them as crimes, and now stares out at the world through uncomprehending eyes that masquerade as worldy cynicism. She sees the hopes and dreams crushed underfoot, the romantic tryst broken up because of politics. She sees the man whose constant fear of his father's approval has driven him to unify his house with authoritarian discipline.

She sees dreamers, visionaries, schemers, and luminaries. She sees sages, writers, poets, lovers. She sees vicious backstabbers. She sees would-be saints. The panoply of passions that inflame the hearts of the Dragon-Blooded are open to her. She sees in their eyes the same thing she has seen in the mirror - the drive to remake Creation into a better world.

Egress takes her time at this point. She looks carefully downward. She recalls how many times Marina and the Priestess had her repeat what she would say. She knows that every word was placed perfectly. She throws all those words away. She calls upon her very deepest powers, letting the passion of faith flow through her. The Zenith is revealed. "We are the right people. We are the Chosen, either by our people, or by the Gods themselves. Our duty is very straight-forward. We must stop the Deathlords. We must protect Creation from the Yozis. We must do all we can to drive back the Wyld that gnaws at our borders from all ways."

"The Realm stands leaderless. It's houses are largely paralyzed," says Egress. "While I have waited for the Realm to mend its wounds, the Deathlords have not been quite so patient. We are not too late. Soon we will begin to take decisive action against the Deathlords. I ask you to join us. There will be glory in this battle. Real glory! True honor!" Her eyes settle on the representative from Cathak at this point, and then to Tepet, as well. There her passion stirs most deeply. Long has their been an emptiness in the hearts of these great warriors. Yet it is not missing from the others. Among those of House Ledaal these words inspire great confidence, as well.

"As some of you know, my people have already struck at the Deathlords on several occasions," says Egress. "Some of you may even know that I have fought a Deathlord." She looks evenly at the Dragon Blooded. The pain in her eyes from that meeting is clear. There is, however, no regret. No fear. "I will do so again. Until they are undone, there can be no peace in Creation. I tell you now, there can be no doubt that they would gladly topple the Realm. I do not wish to destroy the Blessed Isle. I wish to restore it to its proper place."

"And its proper place is as the leader of Creation, not as its taskmaster or tax collector," says Egress. "It is as a first among equals, not as a power above all others." She sighs softly, "Much that was right in Creation has been forgotten. There are many things we must change. I can see in your eyes that you are open to change. I can see that in your hearts you wish to make Creation more glorious than it is now."

The assembled House leaders cannot laugh, or mock, or shout "Anathema" as the epithet they would mean it as. Their pride cannot allow it. No, for though their feelings might balk at accepting such a creature as Egress as human, let alone their equal or ally, their pride is strong as well. And in the fallen wonder of the Blessed Realm, there is not a single wonder mighty as the city in which she now addresses them.

Were they to laugh now, to deride Egress for who and what she is, they would assert their superiority. How hollow it would ring!

"For a very long time now the Realm has set itself apart from the rest of Creation. That attitude has lead to the dangerous situation at hand," explains Egress. "It has caused a division that only my kind has stopped. It has led the people of the Realm to live richer lives, but at the expense of their fellow men. This ends. You see how we live here. We have raised this city not on the broken backs of countless slaves, but with the talents given to us with the aid of our allies. You have seen that my kind are beginning the work that will end slavery."

"You shall also see that we do not simply elevate ourselves. You will speak with the citizens of the Nation of the Sun," says Egress. "You will see that our people live even better than those of the Realm do. You will see that we have helped our neighbors as well. In the North, we have helped the Bull overcome both the forces of the Fair Folk and the Deathlords. Our eyes are turning to other places, now. Perhaps the distant west, perhaps the south. There are many who are crying out for our aid, since the Realm has staggered."

"There is much to do," says Egress. "We cannot do it all. Inevitably, after our forces are deployed, we will have areas that are left in the misery of the shadow. That is why you are here. I know you do not wish to see the Deathlords devour all life. I do not think most in this chamber truly know what they are up against, however. There has been a most casual, patient approach in dealing with this enemy. There might be even be a belief among some that the Deathlords may be bargained with."

"I will disabuse you of this notion. I will take you to the liberated slaves of the Deathlords and you can hear for yourselves what their master's seek," says Egress. "They seek nothing less than the utter dominion of all things, death gives them power. Every body not properly prepared adds to their nearly endless hordes." She shakes her head, "My followers have worked throughout the Threshold, teaching all they meet the burial rites that will bar our enemy from stealing the dead."

"You have seen the flowers of the Garden of Ranapura," says Egress. "It is a plant called lifeweed, and many days and nights have I sung it from seedling to full bloom so that it may be spread below us. A grave upon which lifeweed grows may never be touched by the dark spells of the Enemy. Any who wish to grow it may take the seeds, or, if they prefer, a whole plant. Any blow against the Deathlords is a victory for Creation."

Much of this the Great Houses have heard before, in private reports, or sometimes from the younger, less delicate members of House Ledaal. Centuries of relative immunity on the Blessed Isle have insulated them from the threat of the Deathlords, and it shows. Likewise, the plight of slaves does not dig deeply into their hearts.

"Before you met me, you likely doubted much of what you were told about my people," says Egress. "Allow me to show you the power of a Deathlord. I will show you a place that I do not eagerly go to. I will show you where Gallius Leom died, and Egress began. Moreover, I will show you the very moment she fell. I will show you what it means to battle an army of the restless dead." She does not look like she relishes the prospect much. "I will also show you that your slaves are soon to be utterly obsolete. My friend Davron can demonstrate this for you. What he has made is more loyal, more powerful, and less rebellious than any slave."

The audience ends after a few polite words. The trip must be carefully planned, and the only way to satisfy the visitors from the Realm is to allow them to bring a small number of their followers to the battlesite. Along the way, Davron is given the chance to show off the capabilities of his constructs. Egress is hardly idle. She speaks with the Dragon Blooded one on one, learning far more from their words than they might think. She seeks to know what matters to them. She seeks to learn how they view her. Marina and the Priestess have also come, guiding the Zenith with careful advice.
