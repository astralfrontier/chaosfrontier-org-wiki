The Priestess has called for Egress to meet her in her chambers. The woman is clad in the homespun cloth robes of more recent times, a stark contrast to the haughty grandeur which once informed her attire. She is simpler, but no less a sage.

As Egress enters she nods her head politely. "I wish to teach you the true essence of the Immaculate doctrine," she says. "It will be necessary."

"It indeed seems it is time to learn the very core of the beliefs that have shored-up Creation for an age," answers Egress. "It will be critical to understand these distant cousins I with whom I wish to restore ties." Though the Zenith has slept little as of late, there is a fire in her eyes that banishes any sign of exhaustion.

The woman nods, then gestures with one hand, sweeping around her room to indicate the modest possessions she keeps. The small table and the pillow on which she rests to perform calligraphy; the unrolled mattress on which she sleeps; the blanket and headrest; the chest of drawers in which she keeps her changes of clothes; a washbasin. "You see before you the ten thousand things, all the creations of Heaven," she says. "Each has its place." To demonstrate, she pulls the washbasin from its place and makes a gentle gesture, tipping water onto the calligraphy table. The ink of a half-finished project stains immediately, and the paper itself begins to shrink and contort. "That which does not know its place is destructive to everything around it."

Carefully she returns the basin to its resting place on the chest and withdraws a lilac cutting from one sleeve. The plant has been taken from some of the gardens now being cultivated by Ranapura's growing population. "Some parts of the ten thousand things must be caretakers to the others. They cannot be responsible for everything." Gently she deposits the lilac in the washbasin, stepping away from it and returning her gaze to meet Egress. "The greatest of Heaven's creations must tend to their duties, lest all Creation falter. That is the truth of the Immaculate beliefs. And now we come to your position."

Egress watches the Priestess closely. She nods thoughtfully as the Priestess speaks, "My position is an interesting one." She smiles and looks from her advisor to the basin, "It seems that the beliefs may at least possibly lend themselves to our need. With much care."

"You believe similar things, if you look closely." The Priestess nods in agreement as she speaks, and gestures at the washbasin. "What you must now understand is this. Thousands of men have died since the Sun rose today. Most likely more. And however you protest this, their fates are unimportant. What is important, and what has been given into your care, is to rule a world in which men do not die needlessly. A world where the gifts of the Celestial Hierarchy are used to promote order and harmony. That is your care. The fates of the people who live in that world will be protected by the forces you bring into being."

"The Great Houses are similar. The Blessed Isle is in their care. To them, what happens to individual men is unimportant. _This is as it ought to be._" She stresses her words, holding her gaze steady as she speaks, knowing that she may offend and radiating confidence that what she says must be heard. "Their burden is weighty now. If you force more upon them than they can bear, you will lose them. Remember their place in Heaven's scheme, and your own."

"But what happens to men as a whole is important," answers Egress. "And we must not forget that, either. The point of this meeting is not to ask more, but to guide them to their right place. To restore one of the most challenged places in Creation-and the strongest-to the order it once had." The Zenith looks down at her hands, "I want to lift from them burdens they have shouldered for too long. I have looked in their eyes, Priestess. I have seen what they are. In their hearts they are miserable. They have been twisted and warped, doing something for which they were not intended."

The Priestess nods slowly. "In the heart of anyone who opposes the Realm, there is the potential to let bitter resentment see the Dragon-Blooded as monsters, or tyrants. If they are, remember what else they are."

"I am grateful that you do."

"They are beautiful," whispers Egress. "They were meant to be that way. They are now doing something that is simply not right. There was no good choice. I understand that. There is a choice, now. In their hearts, they want to be what they were meant to be. There is something inside them that still remembers. I know it!"

The Priestess smiles. "'In all things, a seed of Heaven grows.' Now go. You need me no more."

"For the moment," answers Egress softly.

Egress brings the congregation of the Realm and Lookshy to the Crater an hour before dawn. She has prepared something very special for their coming. "Together let us make a day to remember. A day that shall be remembered as a most sacred day," she says. She does not go alone. Her Circle attends her (at least those who are not far away) and she also has brought some of the young daughters of the Dragon Princes. In particular, those who have come to learn from the Solars of Ranapura the ways of growing things. Each of these bears a large bushel, the contents carefully hidden for the moment.

"First, we must see was has taken place here. We must see what has tortured the land that we walk upon," says Egress. It is a land tormented. It cracks beneath every step, for the ground still is like brittle glass. None willingly come here. There is a wrongness in the air, an emptiness that knows no filling. Still, there is someone who has come here. In the bowl of the crater stands the Solar Ra, who has come to aid Egress with his impressive gifts.

"My friends from the Blessed Isle, allow me to introduce you to Ra. Once, this Solar was stolen from his destiny by the Deathlords. His spark was tainted and twisted. They call themselves the Abyssals, yet their hearts are not blackened beyond healing, just as the death of Gallius was not beyond healing." Egress smiles and goes on, "He went to a place we call Gaia. That is where I first met him. He had been purified over the course of centuries, and sacrificed his very memories to aid my Circle in returning. He stands before you now to reveal what you must see. You must see the wrath of the Deathlords. You must see the power of an army that fears nothing, for it is already dead. It cannot be broken, for it has already lost everything. It can only be annihilated."

Ra nods his head politely, but stays silent. His focus is already upon the magic he works. In the dark, the sudden appearance of the armies that were clashing here seems more abrupt to Egress somehow. She notes that some of the Dragon Blooded reach for their weapons as they are suddenly engulf in the images, but that impulse fades swiftly, when they realize that they are seeing naught but memories.

For what else can they be, when the very first images send waves of creatures beyond description bursting right through the crowded exalts. The noise is real, though. The screaming of men, the high, horrible cries of the undead, the noise of arrows flying through the air. There's a strange mix of cold and heat in battle, and a stink of rotting, and spilled blood, and sweat is strong in the air. Here and there the lines of Dace's men can be seen, holding fast against nightmares that none of them dared dream. Yet they do not break. Dace is among them, and his power radiated outward. Where he goes, men are stronger, the armies of the restless dead falter and are hammered back. He is restless, and he is not alone.

The skies are ruled by the god Rain of Fire and her rider. Yet their target is not just the armies below. There is a terror in the midst of the enemy that is greater than any other. It is the very core of all its power, and against it none may stand. The armies of light call her only the Dowager, denying her her titles and not knowing her true name. Her power drives on her slaves, and those the might of the Solars is great, her power is far greater still.

All about them the Terrestrials see the power of the dead armies. They wear down the greatest of the soldiers. It is easy to see how well equipped and drilled the army of the Nation is, yet one by one the men are drawn away, dragged to the ground by the enemy, for even though they hew off their hands and heads, their grips do not fade, and the heroes of the Nation are laid low, dragged off amongst their enemies and torn apart by the pitiless foe.

The situation is bleak. Yet nothing prepares the Dragon Blooded for what comes next. She is simply there. The Dowager of the Irreverent Vulgate in Unrent Veils. There is no way to prepare for such a vision. Though she is not truly here at this moment, the power of her presence, the manic terror that spreads out from her light a thousand nightmares can be felt. Her slaves are filled with a fury that drives them madly against the living. The darkness that is about her is something that even now pours right into the soul.

But there is light. Egress is holding her spear, and a glow has come to her to rival this image of darkness, and she points upward suddenly. And the Dowager lifts her head to see there, in the sky, is a brilliant glare as Gallius has seen her true enemy and has come to face her. Outmatched, overpowered, but unafraid.

Egress dimly remembers what happens. She recalls the rushing of the wind as she fell. She remembers channelling every bit of herself into her attack. What she cannot recall is what happened after. There is little to see, however, for at the moment of contact an eruption of raw essence blazes outwards, causing many of the dragon-blooded to shield their eyes. Some duck away. For those who do not shy away, however, the collapse of Egress' body can be seen, as can the agonized retreat of the Dowager. All about them the armies are in ruins, blasted by the heat of gathered essence, many of them completely incinerated. The vision ends.

Egress sighs softly, and tears flow from her eyes. "A glorious day," she says quietly. "But a painful victory. A price beyond any I have known before or since." She turns to look upon the Dragon-Blooded, "I will face this again. They must be stopped. Around them, all things die. They destroy everything they can reach. Do you see now what they are like? Do you understand what we face?"

Cathak Cainan has seen many things, fought in many battles. It is simply a part of what it means to be of Cathak. Yet he stands with his jaw open, stunned. Around him the Dragon Blooded have huddled closer together. Even those of Lookshy stand nearer their rivals than they would normally wish to. Better to stand near them, even facing only the visions of the Dowager's wrath. After a few long, silent moments, they look to each other. Should they believe what they have seen? Somehow, seeing the tears of Egress and the pain in her eyes makes it hard to disbelieve. "She didn't die?" asks one of the lesser advisors, her voice coming out in something of a squeak.

"The Dowager is not so easily killed," replies Egress quietly. "Fortunately, neither am I. Her strength comes from darkness, a devouring malice that envies for Creation. My strength comes from the love and respect of my friends and allies. It comes from the gifts of the Sun, and the favor of the Moon and the Maidens." She looks to the bushel-bearers and nods to them, and they begin to walk about the crater, casting out the contents of the bushels a handful at a time. The wind rises to aid them, whirling the seeds in the air. "Too long has the land laid dead," whispers Egress. "Too long has this memory lingered here." Her tears she does not wipe away. She does not shed any more, however.

Instead, she begins to sing, and as she sings the dawn comes, and with the light the power of her voice grows more clear. Lifeweed blooms all about the crater, finding root in the miniscule cracks in the crater and growing, growing and blooming all around the party. Egress' song is a prayer to the heavens, a celebration of life in the face of death, of simple joy to see the sun once more. It is a prayer that does not go unnoticed.

In the very midst of the crater, as all about the song brings life to this barren place, a spring begins at a trickle, then erupts skyward in a great fountain, blasting upwards as the gods smile upon this meeting. This water Egress greets with a smile, her face turning skyward as the water comes down as a fine rain, the water warmed as the sun finally climbs wholly above the horizon.

For a moment, the Dragon Blooded are flabbergasted, but one of House Ledaal murmurs, "It is but the stone she bears." Egress pauses and smiles, drawing out the hearthstone and saying, "Indeed, there is power in this stone." She casts it to one of the bearers and raises her voice once more in song, and it is as if a shade had been torn away. Before, the plants grew more swiftly. Now they spread like a flowing tide over the crater, and around the edges of the crater the land is turned and ripples like water as trees shoot upward, visibly growing as the power of the Zenith flares beyond even the strength of the stone.

It goes beyond the seen. The very essence of the land shifts and is aligned. There is a sudden feeling of change as the power of demense finds its place here, and its strength shines forth. When at last the song of Egress ends, it seems to not end at all. Her voice simply continues on in the sound of the fountain, the sigh of the wind in the trees and over the earth. It does not end. "There is no stone that can do this," whispers V'neef. "Can't you feel it?" She looks to Egress, trying to find the words. She does not know what to say.

"It is what I am," says Egress. "It is what I was meant to be." She looks from V'neef to the others. "There is no other answer. There are things greater still than the artifacts of jade and orichalcum, of moonsilver and star metal. We are greater than those things, my Lady. You and I are greater by far than those heirlooms we bear. Do not forget that you were Chosen."

The words might seem as a barb, except for the way Egress spoke them. This is not the reminder of a parent to a foolish child, but the promise that Egress knows the value of Dragon-Blooded, and appreciates that they, like her, have a high place in Creation. This vision, this treatment by one who has just demonstrated something beyond anything outside of their legends, has an effect that is impossible to perfectly describe. In some, it comes faster than to others. There is an admiration, and a sense of kinship and perhaps even the seeds of love for one who can not only do great things, but clearly wishes to achieve great things with them and to share that glory. Yet there is one thing that is impossible to utterly escape in the hearts of the Dragon-Blooded: this woman is beyond them. What she has done is something that all of them together, though they are among the greatest of their people, could never have achieved.

Morever, she is not alone, and those who would stand near her are clearly her match. They wonder at the one who showed them in, the one whose creations they are told will make slaves obsolete. They wonder about her other allies, for they have heard mention of other names. Ramar, the traveler whose journeys go beyond the borders of Creation and Chi-Yosh, the warrior who slays even behemoths without fear.

In the minds of some come fantasies of what might be. The Realm has many gifted hands. Surely it deserves the attention that Egress has given this place! Surely this Solar queen might come there. Among the open-minded comes the thought of this great force for growth living in the Realm, free to restore it to its greatness. And if she should come there, surely she might be willing to take the throne, to put a stop to the bickering that can only end in a bitter civil war. There is a new hope in their hearts, a new dream, and yet they wonder if they dare act on it? Should they let her know of this desire?

Others, however, see only a power beyond controlling. They do not understand. They see themselves as meaningless if they are not the ultimate power. They cannot imagine that the Solar would be any different. Yet even in those hard hearts there is the seed of loyalty, and their dreams shall be troubled and their spirits conflicted, though they will not be sure why. Naturally, wrong as they are in spirit due to this, they shall suspect the workings of the 'enemy' have reached into their minds.

The Dragon-Blooded are now allowed to tour what parts of the Nation they wish to see. They are given guides, but are not ushered or pressured. They may do as they will, so long as they do not cause harm. They see the armies, they see the academies, they see a bureacracy and organization in the Nation of the Sun that is beyond anything seen in the Realm. Materials and manpower are simply where they belong, and business flows smoothly through the carefully regulated markets of the Nation of the Sun.

The Dynasts scatter and travel for a fortnight, attending many celebrations and parties and finding themselves remarkably well-treated. Though some view them with suspicion and many are wary of their desires, the will of Egress is heeded. The guests are to be treated with respect and to what extent is possible, as friends as well.

Every night, a variety of sorceries and techniques are used, and the Solars are aware of at least most of them. Infallible Messenger of the Terrestrial Circle is common, but the Air-Aspected spellweavers that many of the Houses employ also demonstrate their unique command of the winds by casting their thoughts out to the commanders of their armies. Egress understands - it is the continued paranoia of the powerful. Regardless of their feelings, these men and women remain true to their natures.

One of the things the Solars do glean from these communications, however, is that orders are steadily guiding the armies away from each other, and into tactically advantageous positions. Here, and most probably on the Blessed Isle as well, the Great Houses are preparing for war.

Each of them thinks the same - 'whatever my decision, I do not know the truth of my rivals, or even my allies. I must be prepared.' And at this point, their minds are decided - must be decided. They will either embrace the Solar offer, or react out of fear.

"Strange to think that, three years ago, _this_ was my whole world," Davron says softly, looking upon the wooden gates to the village of Arzas. "So much as I remember... and yet different. Changed for the better, at that..." It is late morning, and the breeze blows Davron's flaxen hair this way and that, as he looks upon his birthplace through the eyes of the past. His eyes pass over the rough-cut lumber that surrounds the village proper, flinching briefly at one spot - he remembers standing there, a lifetime ago, watching his father collapse through a rising red mist. And the next day fleeing, leaving the only home he'd ever known, a home that dreaded the Anathema that had arisen in their midst.

Things are different now. Many of the villagers remember who had saved them from the slavers of Bridal Veil; and other tales have filtered back to the village of the exploits of Davron and his friends. Davron who smashed the gates of Bridal Veil and smote its lord; Davron who awakened the golden war-armor of Defiler's Grave; Davron who aided Chi-Yosh the Tomb-Raider of Nexus; Davron who walked with his fellow sun-gods beyond the borders of this world and returned to tell the tale - for in Arzas it is always the native son who takes center stage in the adventures of the Circle, even though a more objective account would tend to place him in a supporting role rather than the central figure of the narrative.

But as the children rush to greet the returning hero and tug at his brightly-dyed homespun robes, as the adults pause in their daily routine to watch in awe as Davron walks purposefully through the streets, one tale is fresh in everyone's mind, and one in which their hometown champion is undeniably the star of the show. "Is it true? Did you really make a city fly?" "Doesn't it hurt when the clouds bump into you?" "No, silly, not with Davvie making it, they'd bounce right off..." "Can we see it? Can we go and visit Ranapura someday?"

Davron laughs heartily. "_Go_ to visit my city?" he says, reaching down to tousle the young lad's hair. "Little one, me and my city will come to visit _you_ someday. That's what a flying city's _for_, you know. But right now, I just want to visit my kinfolk."

Willow is waiting by the door of the hut when Davron arrives - no longer her parents' hut, either, and Davron thinks he remembers whose it is. "I was wondering when you'd come back," she says. "I'd like you to meet my husband," she says, and another tanned young man smiles a little nervously as he offers his hand. Davron's cheerful grin is wholehearted as he reaches out to return the handshake firmly - he'd remembered correctly. "Thomas Fletcher, eh? Pop'd be proud, he always spoke highly of you and your dad's work. Taking good care of my Willow here, I see?"

"O-of course!" says Thomas a little too earnestly. Davron never did learn to read people as astutely as Egress or Ramar had, but even he can read the flicker in Thomas' eyes; something is worrying Thomas, although it is probably blown out of proportion by the man's fear of his former colleague turned sun-god. Clearly a careful hand is needed.

"May I come in for a moment?" says Davron. Thomas' eyes glance to Willow, who merely smiles and gestures gracefully to Davron. Once inside and away from the prying ears of the villagers, Davron asks gently, "Is there something troubling you?"

Thomas looks down and shuffles his feet. "Actually," he admits, his voice quavering, "business has been a little rough lately. Da' came outa retirement while I was... was away, an' by the time you brought us back, he was havin' too much fun to stop. Now everyone's buyin' their fletchings from him. No one wants to buy from the 'prentice when the master's around, see."

Davron nods. Of all people, _he_ can sympathize with being eclipsed by his own father. "Perhaps it'd help if you moved to another town? Established yourself on your own? You might say apprentice, but I _know_ you finished that before I left town."

Thomas shakes his head. "Where'd I go? Fordham down the river's already got two fletchers, and you know the potter upriver's one of the best around here, and Willow don't want to give up potterin' yet. We want to get oursel's established before..." Thomas blushes, and trails off.

Davron laughs. "Yeah, I know. You'd need a crowbar to pry Willow from behind the wheel," he says, grinning at his cousin, and rubs his chin. "But... I know you both are good. A lot better than you might realize. Maybe you ought to set your sights a little... higher. Literally." And with that, Davron pulls two slips of parchment from a pocket, each bearing a sigil of five gears within a gear: the symbol of Ranapura.

Thomas' and Willow's eyes both go wide, and they are both speechless for a moment. Willow is the first to speak. "You... you're serious? Us, go to live and work in Ranapura?" Davron nods, seriously. "I _know_ you can handle it. Both of you." He smiles, then. "It's a big decision, and I won't pressure you to make up your minds quickly. But there's a place for you in the sky-city, if ever you want it."

Thomas blinks at the ticket in his hand for a moment longer, and then looks up at his wife, who smiles and nods eagerly. He breaks into a broad grin, and reaches out to shake Davron's hand. "You're all right, Dav," he says. "You just give us time to pack, all right? Hey, wanna give us a hand?"

Davron chuckles. "I'd love to, Tom, but you and Willow're both young and strong," he says, and then his tone becomes more somber. "Ma isn't. If she wants to move up, she'll need my help." With that, he bows slightly. "I'll be back in a bit, all right?"

A few moments later, Davron is embracing his mother warmly. She is indeed lame, and walks with the aid of a walking-stick these days, but she waves off her son's attempts at support as she hobbles back her chair, urging Davron to sit by her. "Your dad would be proud of you, you know," she says. "I know he never told you, but... he always said you'd be better than him someday."

"I know, Mom," Davron says, tears glistening in his eyes, as he remembers his final meeting with the shade of his father, amidst Gaia's entourage at the Carnival. "I..." He stops, shaking his head. Some things, even now, are too painful to talk about. "How have you been?"

"I'd be a lot better if you visited once in a while, young man!" she says, poking Davron playfully with her cane, a bit of the old fire burning in her eyes - though there is warmth as well. "Honestly, I don't know... gallivanting all over Creation with your shiny new friends... how can I keep an eye on you when you're a thousand miles away all the time?"

Davron knows his mother too well to be upset by this outburst - he knows what's behind it. She's worried about him, always has been, always will be. There's just something about being a mother. "Well, maybe it'd be easier if you lived a little closer?" he says, pulling out a third Ranapura ticket.

The old woman leans forward to squint at the parchment, then go wide. "What, me go live in that flying city of yours? At my age? What earthly good am I going to do in a place like that?"

"Ranapura is a city for _families,_ Mother," says Davron softly. "And you and Willow are the only family I've got right now. I just invited Willow and Thomas to go there, and I think they'd appreciate a familiar face around. You know Willow always looked up to you." Davron sighs. "Besides... I'd feel better knowing you were close by. Please?"

Davron's mother cackles, suddenly. "What do you mean, we're the only family you've got? Haven't you found a nice young girl to settle down with yet?" She gives him another poke with the cane, and Davron blushes hotly. "Well-" he begins, but is cut off. "If you can't find one for yourself, I'm obviously gonna _have_ to come up there and find one for you!"

"Mooom!" Davron protests, but he can't stop himself from laughing and grinning. "Honestly, why do you have to be such a... such a mom?" He takes a deep breath. "All right, all right. If you move up to Ranapura, I promise I'll introduce you to Rumika. Okay?"

"Ooooo... Rumika, eh? So my little boy _has_ found himself a girl, has he?" says she, savoring the name. "Tell me what she's like! Is she cute?"

Davron laughs. "Not telling. You're gonna have to come up and see her for yourself!"

This gets another amused cackle and another poke with the cane. "Ooo, you sneaky boy you, trying to trick your dear old mother up into the big city just so's she can see who's gonna be having her grandkids, eh?" says the old woman, leering at Davron. "She better be good enough for my boy, or she'll feel the wrong end of my cane, so she will!"

Wondrous things are afoot in Creation. The call of adventure beckons, the need to do great things grows stronger. It is as though the world itself is preparing for something massive. The return to the Scarlet Throne... no, that moniker needs to be changed, the return to the Blessed Isle is nearing. Battle with the Deathlords, and worse things lies on the road ahead as well. Everyone is taking steps to make ready for this journey into a new age... and Ramar is no exception. For he seeks the old ornaments of office for the Hierophant... the Ring of the Deliberative. _With it_, he surmises, _Egress will be able to help guide all of Creation... and perhaps in this way, needless blood need not be spilled. Of course I shall have to find it first..._

It is in the Libraries of Cloudburst that Ramar begins his search. He thumbs through old tomes, where glimpses of the First Age are still recorded, and from the ancient texts pieces together tiny fragments of the past. After hours of sifting through the sands of time and poring through history, Ramar has finally found a likely next step.

The Yanaze River, mightiest of Waterways in the Eastern Lands, and indeed, throughout Creation. Water traffic flows on it's surface almost unceasingly, and it connects remote parts of Creation with the more populated hub in the East. Where better a place than this to entomb the one who lead through the unity of the Deliberative? The signs are there, for those who know what to look for. Hidden nexuses of Essence that congregate in places of power just beneath the surface of the water, outside of the glances of common men.

From a small boat, powered only by oars and a small sail, Ramar follows one of the Water Dragon's tracks. He sails as easily across the water as through the air, and traces its twisting flowing power until he comes to a place where it seems to swirl in an almost undetectable eddy. It is the home of a river god... and more importantly, a place that fits the Threefold Appeasements of the Soul; an ancient burial rite used to prevent powerful ghosts from rising.

He slips beneath the waves unceremoniously, and as he dives deeper and deeper, his own Essence attunes with that around him. The elements themselves cannot touch him. He has no need for air nor can the crushing pressure of the depths break his bones. As the darkness of the depths closes in, Ramar's Caste Mark brightens, bringing the light of the Unconquered Sun even here.

Shalkth, a river god whose shape is gradually beginning to turn to that of the Dragon, appears before Ramar. His voice is the rumbling of the earth from the depths, his movements are currents, and in his eyes the light of the Sun is reflected a thousand times. **Greetings, Prince of Earth. Know that you are nearing sanctified ground and may not disturb it.** "I know," replies Ramar. "It is this very ground which I seek, great spirit. I do not come to loot, nor to desecrate, but merely to learn." He explains his quest to the river spirit, and fills in any details that the spirit asks for.

With the blessings of the river god, Ramar enters the tomb. An unassuming stone archway leads into carved stone tunnels, lightless and flooded. The tunnles themselves are set with runes that ward against the dead while also telling of the life of the Solar entombed within. As Ramar navigates the labyrinthine network of passages, he learns more about the life of the last Solar to be known as Hierophant. Crimes, triumphs... many things.

The exploration of the tomb is carried out slowly and methodically. The old wards are left intact and nothing is taken... nothing save information. As he makes his way to those chambers which are not submerged, he studies the tomb with senses sharper than mere mortals. A crack in the stone made by tools, a disruption of sigils... anything that might indicate that someone has been here. Or perhaps what might have happened to the Ring before he arrived.

As he works, the spirit seems to always be over his shoulder. Its ever-watchful gaze ensures that no harm will come to the tomb or the one exploring it. With its help, Ramar's task becomes more reverential. The spirit points out what offerings had been made in the past, and advises him which parts to keep clear of, for his own safety.

The work continues on, with Ramar unaware of the turning of the Sun and Moon in the skies above. Deep beneath the surface of the Yanaze, he learns more of what happened before. Though this is the tomb of the last Hierophant, the Ring is not buried within. It passed beyond the hands of the Hierophant... but though it is not entombed here... its story is.

The final meeting with each House's head or delegate is one of carefully-studied and long-practiced neutrality. This is the outcome Egress expected. Those that oppose her will hardly say so to her face, after all, if there is any chance of a safe return to the home ground of the Blessed Isle.

Even those who choose to ally with the Solars will communicate that only in the most secret fashion - and to avoid being spied on, could only do so through the most trusted of messengers or in person. Arranging a private meeting would signal their intentions as well. So for now, nothing can truly be said.

One by one, the members of the Dragon-Blooded delegation arrive. As before, a careful schedule of elemental and House correspondences is used to dictate the timing, and to avoid giving insult. Marina and a Dragon Princess called Shaisa attend to Egress.

One by one the pleasantries are exchanged and the Dragon-Blooded return unmolested to their armies, to return to the Blessed Isle - or so Egress prays. War is still a possibility, after all. One by one, Marina apprises Egress of the truthsay she received.

Houses V'Neef, Ragara, and Tepet were skilled dance partners, but all of Marina's cunning and skill are bent on bringing the truth out of their words. They will not oppose Egress, but they are not prepared to declare themselves openly. The three Houses seem willing to deal with each other as allies. When one finally moves, the others will as well.

House Cynis fears the offer the Solars make, but will not move openly against them - or so Marina believes. The Priestess concurs.

House Cathak is torn. The Priestess suspects that the leadership fully supports the Solar offering in principle, but is weighing the cost to themselves and their armed forces.

House Mnemon and House Sesus are closely aligned, but for different reasons. Mnemon will not brook any rival to the Scarlet Throne, as is clear to Marina and Egress both. House Sesus is far more difficult to read. Marina suspects that Sesus has been shocked by what it has seen. Unable to comprehend their part in the grand design laid out before them, they are retreating to the safety of the known, even if it leads to their downfall.

House Nellens gave the most positive response to the benefits to the un-Exalted, but will most likely withhold support out of fear. Should the tide clearly turn, so will their decision. For now, they are dedicated to protecting the people they are responsible for, and for now, that means defending the status quo of the Realm.

House Ledaal was swayed entirely by the vision of the battle. At last, one of their greatest fears has ceased to be an unavoidable fate. The dread rulers of the grave can be beaten. They have seen it.

House Peleps is the most difficult. They spoke skillfully enough that no hint of truth or deception could be extracted from their words, and Marina admits she has met her match in them.

House Iselsi does not meet formally with the Solars, of course. Nothing can be said about them yet.

The last meeting is with Ramar, who has returned with a tale to tell. And the story he tells gives Egress the news she needs. With this, it may be powerful to sway the remaining Dragons' Get.
