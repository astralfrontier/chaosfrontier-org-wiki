# Gods of Eden 2006-02-24

With the Realm on the very brink of civil war, and things in the balance, Egress knows of one very sure way to decide things with less bloodshed: to field an army so vast and so powerful that one would have to be an imbecile to stand against it. Even calling up the reserves of the Nation she hasn't enough, and she knows it. Fortunately, there is another force of great power that is just dying to slake its thirst for vengeance upon the Realm. Unfortunately, that thirst for vengeance is very great, indeed. The wrath of Ma-Ha-Suchi and those who serve alongside him is something that Egress has thwarted once. She paid dearly.

This time, however, Egress is far stronger. She is also better prepared. That she is Heirophant is not of great consequence, perhaps, but as Ikth-ya, her voice will at least be heard, and she can come to Ma-Ha-Suchi without disgrace, for the duel ended honorably, if not very comfortably. Leaving the marshalling of her forces in the hands of Dace and Marina, she goes back to what was once Harborhead, riding on the back of Rain of Fire with Jin-nu at her side, she will seek the aid of the Lunar hero.

As is the way of the Silver Pact, it is Egress' part to wait for permission to enter Ma-Ha-Suchi's territory. Once granted, it does not take very long to find him. He is restless, an animal too long caged and unable to find proper strength to throw itself again. That strength has not waned in the least, however. Even in the face of the barbarism of the great Lunar, Egress is calm, a silent aura of purpose and hope radiating out from her. The Lunar has seen it before, and can sense in the Zenith a change. "You've grown," comes his greeting. The words are delivered in a grating, abrupt way, and Ma-Ha-Suchi makes a point of scratching himself to show that he's not going to curb his behavior for anyone.

Egress makes a point of ignoring Ma-Ha-Suchi's behavior. He is what he is, and while she can't imagine why she ever would love such a person, that ancient spark's confused emotions can be senses. They can also be repressed. "I see your fierce army is still sitting here, living off the land," she observes evenly. "I would hate to break up their amusements in Harborhead, but I may have something of interest to you. No doubt you have watched the movements inside the Realm. You surely have heard that I have spoken with many of the Dragon-Blooded who have power there."

"The Chieftain of the Eagles spoke to me of it," the Lunar rumbles. "Some deluded nonsense about 'diplomacy' and 'resolution', no doubt."

"Something like that," replies Egress evenly. "I have often thought.. what would be the best solution to our little issue be? You no doubt want to roll a lot of heads. That would be fine, except the guilty are mostly dead. Oh, certainly, there are some who live that are worthy of death. Still, how can you be sure? Do you think every Dragon-Blood must die, Ma-Ha-Suchi?"

Ma-Ha-Suchi paces as he speaks, clasping his claws behind his back in a bestial mockery of a thoughtful statesman. "A man robs you of your family sword. He passes away, but his son keeps the weapon and will not return it despite your claim to it. That he has not robbed you further does not excuse his own crime. The Dragon-Blooded of this generation have grown fat off the sin of their ancestors. They refuse to reconsider the justice of their position."

"Most of them know nothing of the injustice," says Egress. "Still, that is not excuse. If the son learns that the sword is stolen and wishes to return it, yet his brothers will not, is it not enough that he help reclaim what was taken?" asks the Zenith. "Is it enough that he would lay his very life on the line to set things right once more?"

"If there are such men in the Realm," murmurs the Lunar, "they should reveal themselves before I lay my vengeance upon them. But if they continue to play their long game and attempt to use me - and you - then they shall suffer."

"I have a way to find all those men and women," answers Egress. "I know a way to find them all, and reveal all those who stand against us, and we can crush them in one fell swoop. You know I have met the Dragon-Blooded, and I have shown them who and what I am. In their hearts, many believe in me. Even now they are preparing for war, hoping in some dark corner of their souls that I will come to them and show them the way once more. I have no intention of letting them waste themselves on idiotic distractions."

"I mean to take the Realm and correct the twistings of the Immaculates. I am Chosen of the Unconquered Sun, but I am also Ikth-Ya of the Silver Pact. They must see the power of the Heavens revealed in all its strength. The Lunars heed those who are worthy. They will listen to you. I ask you to come and kill the guilty and help me save the good, while there is still something worthy of being saved. There will be enough to slay for all of us."

Ma-Ha-Suchi narrows his eyes and stares at his guest. "Even you cannot discern the hearts of a thousand Terrestrial Exalts at once. I am curious how you propose to solve the riddle of betrayal."

"Civil War," answers Egress. "Those who will support a Solar, even when the odds are not clear, are certainly not likely to be those who will betray us later," she explains. "It is to me a straight forward idea. I ask for your aid, but not until it is the right time. Not until we've revealed them. I would prefer not to slaughter too many mortals in this. They are being misled, and they have been enfeebled by years of poor leadership. It is the Dragon-Blooded who must pay dearly for what they have done. I am changing my plans. I will take in an army good enough to make war, yet not so strong as to make it a clear victory. If I did that, greed and cowardice would draw them over. No, it is far better to make them pick based on the value in their hearts. That will show us the truth more in a fair and very clear manner, don't you agree?"

"You speak of men who hide the truth from each other centuries at a time. You lack the years to see that, in spite of your gifts." The Lunar makes a rumbling noise. "Your traveler can take oaths from the heads of the Great Houses, pledging fealty to this new Deliberative. But if those men have unfaithful lessers, what will you do?"

"There will always be the unfaithful. That is not a matter of Chosen or not. There will always be those who seek to benefit at the cost of others," says Egress. "I shall show them justice. Loyalty shall be rewarded with glory, betrayal shall taste the painful bite of justice. It shall be as it should be. We cannot prevent all treason for all time. That is not my goal. I seek the Realm, and it is my will to destroy as many of our bitter opposition as I can."

Ma-Ha-Suchi chuckles. It is not a pleasant sound. "Very well. Return in a week's time. I will answer you then."

"I will return." She pauses to add, "Even without the aid of the Lunars, I will go on. I think you already knew that, though." Egress departs with her friends, travelling towards Denandsor to see to still more preparations. The whole of Creation must be ready when this hammer falls.

---

Back in Denandsor, Egress goes over reports. The progress of the Dragon Kings is always something she concerns herself with. It seems they are doing well, and the rebuilding is moving at a slow, steady pace. The Nation of the Sun is working as expected. Marina's coordination of resources has ships ready and waiting to carry the many stores needed for war, as well as the great wagons and beasts of burder to draw them. Of course, several Solars know what Egress plans, and many wish to make names for themselves in the battles to come. The Dawns especially seem keen for a chance to gain some measure of vengeance, haunted by dreams of their betrayal centuries ago.

The Priestess has Egress' ear constantly, and frets over details that are beyond the notice of the Zenith. She is not alone, as Cloudburst provides a wealth of background information and incredibly detailed maps of the Realm. The Master as well is revealed, bringing with him a young circle of Solars who seek to make their way into the world. The work that Egress is doing is exactly the sort of thing a young Solar dreams of taking part in.

Though the circle may be young, only two of them are truly younger than Egress. Their leader is an Eclipse with a shrewd mind and a calm manner. Even Egress comes to appreciate the presence of Drifting Snow over the days in Denandsor. With the Heirophant's own circle busy with other things or venturing off to see to other tasks, these young Solars find themselves kept quite busy handling affairs. They are not orders, precisely, but things that simply need doing. Egress seems to have a talent for inspiring cooperation, even among her own people.

This talent is something the Zenith Trialn tries to emulate. He is not yet strong enough, but he is blessed with a patience that helps curb the manic energy of the Heirophant as she leaps from task to task. When Marina and the Priestess are not there to help Egress accept that there are things beyond her reach, Trialn does so. His is not the overawing presence that she has, nor the fiery, passionate speech, but is simply a quiet certainty that is conveyed in every action. How surprised he is when the Heirophant says how very much she admires him for that! "I think all of us have things to learn from each other," he observes. Egress certainly sees that.

Archer, sorcerer, craftsman... tour guide? Davron seems to be spending a remarkable amount of his time these days showing important newcomers around the city of Ranapura - though truth be told, he quite enjoys exhibiting his handiwork. The sky-train in particular always gets a suitably awed response. But sometimes even Davron gets a surprise. Today, the tour group consists of the Master's latest prodigies, and one green-haired young man, instead of looking out the windows and enjoying the view, seems to be occupied in pacing the cabin, his fingers dancing along the seashell beads of an abacus.

This, of course, catches Davron's attention, and when the lad seems to finish what he's doing and looks up, Davron favors him with a broad grin. "Something wrong with the measurements, is there?" he asks.

"Well, yeah, as a matter of fact there is," says the other, and Davron raises an eyebrow. "The cabin ought to be two feet longer, and the walls at the bow ought to form a..." - a quick glance back at the abacus - " ninety-three degree angle with the front wall. The air will like the shape better and get out of your way."

Davron shakes his head. "That won't work, because..." he begins, and then gets a faraway look. He then pulls out his own abacus, and the train's cabin resounds with the echo of wooden beads clicking against one another. "Well, the way it is gives the cabin more durability, but... let's see... over a..." Davron trails off in silence, wood rattling against wood as he calculates frantically.

Finally, Davron stops cold, remembering an occult craftsmanship treatise he himself had studied under the Master, not so long ago. "Oh. Of course! _Principles of Naval Design_! How could I have forgotten that?" he says, glancing sheepishly at the Master, who only raises an eyebrow. Turning back to the boy, Davron says, "Jarod, was it?" he says. "Rather impertinent of you, don't you think, trying to call attention to a design flaw in your host's own craftsmanship?" Davron winks, and holds out a hand. "Keep it up." Jarod laughs heartily and returns the handshake.

At the appointed hour, Egress again sets off to meet with Ma-Ha-Suchi, wondering just what his answer shall be. She has thought often of him in the past few days. Something in her still hopes that she can fight at his side again. Something in her knows that it is inevitable. The war for all of Creation is only beginning. The Lunars and the Solars eventually shall have no choice but to face the enemy side by side on many fronts. Egress says little when she meets the Lunar hero this time. The time for long speeches is past. "I have come. Do you wish to fight the war in the way I suggest?" She knows no reason to waste time.

In his barbaric hall in the jungles of the Southeast, Ma-Ha-Suchi has awaited his visitor. Now he stands among a circle of other Lunars, of all three Castes, as Egress makes her simple demand.

"When you march, the Deathlords will march. When the Deathlords march, I will march. We will not hold back."

"Everything that we..." Ma-Ha-Suchi pauses. Egress sees on his face something she has never, ever imagined in her wildest dreams: a look of abject surprise. He, and the other Lunars as well, are staring past Egress.

Striding into the firelight is an enormous man - seven feet and a half, and burly beyond belief. His hair is white and hangs to his waist, and he is bearded. His eyes glow a brilliant blue, seemingly orbs of water without a visible iris. His footfall is silent; none saw him arrive until he was almost at Egress' back.

There is little doubt who he is, even without words, for already Ma-Ha-Suchi is bending the knee to him. The other elders follow.

Egress stands aside and kneels as well. It is what she had wished for, but didn't believe could happen. The words were sent as a warning. A gesture for the greatest living of the Chosen to prepare should her attempts end in disaster. She could think of no one else who might be capable of keeping Creation in one piece should it go poorly on the Blessed Isle. No one but one man. Leviathan himself.

Leviathan makes a casual hand gesture, pointing out Egress and Ma-Ha-Suchi with his fingers. He turns, then, walking back into the darkness.

Ma-Ha-Suchi follows, glancing at Egress as he goes.

Egress rises swiftly and follows. She is not sure what shall happen. She only knows that this is an auspicious day. That much she doesn't need a Sidereal to tell her.

---

Leviathan walks, parallel to a stream which wanders through the jungle. Arriving at a low hill, he holds up a hand to the other two, then ascends. A few minutes later, an explosive sound heralds a torrential shower of dirt and rocks as the hill explodes. Trees and branches come flying past, and the two Exalts dodge desperately to avoid the debris. When it clears, they approach to find that Leviathan has hollowed the hill out into a sort of bowl-shaped depression. It is disturbing to see the imprint of his knuckles still in solid stone, at the bottom-most point of the basin.

The ancient voice of the ancient mariner finally speaks. "Training. Don't leave the circle."

Egress tries her best not to be wide-eyed at what she's just seen. She's not entirely sure she's successful, however. She nods once to the greatest of Lunar Heroes and looks to Ma-Ha-Suchi for a moment. She can only wonder what exactly she's in for. For the moment, she's going to be quite. If one thing is true of Lunars that she's met, it is that they don't speak when they do not need to.

Leviathan pulls from the pockets of his robes a pair of scrolls and presents them. One capped in silver, one in gold. Egress unrolls hers, watching Ma-Ha-Suchi do the same, and reads. The parchment is ancient, clearly preserved by some magic from ancient times, and the script is in a painfully antiquated dialect of Old Realm. It contains the secrets of a Charm, called the Conjunction Asana by the introductory text.

Egress studies the scroll with a thoughtful frown. The Conjunction Asana. She wonders what it means, and what it will do. She wonders why it is necessary they stay in this circle to master it. It seems clear, however, that whatever she is to learn, Ma-Ha-Suchi shall be learning with her. In a small way, that is comforting.

"Magnificent Beast-God Transformation.." Ma-Ha-Suchi is murmuring aloud. It seems that he has received a similar gift. He glances at Egress, frowns, and resumes his reading.

Egress is not just learning a charm. It's something simply beyond her. As she reads it, though, there is a flowing of power that comes directly from her spark. Her body changes as essence sifts through her flesh in new ways, changing her in moments. In her mind, she begins to see the puzzles of this new challenge. Again, the influences of the past are strong. She can remember something similar to this. Part of her recalls when charms were stored away on scrolls and valued more than any artifact for the power locked within.

And in that recollection, her mind shifts. She recalls in the battle against the Dowager how her troops were positioned and she instantly knows where they would have been better placed. She sees a link between the history of the Houses and her oncoming war that had eluded her. She can foresee a failure in the supply chain that she has to rectify. In the space of seconds, it comes, and when it ends she simply knows more than she ever has before. She can begin at least to grasp what she holds.

What she holds is a challenge. An exhausting one. It is a mixture of raw knowledge and relentless energy. She draws deeply of the essence around her. Deeper. Her will she focuses like the tip of a spear, and so she begins. What exactly a charm text says is hard to express. It is like explaining the power of music, or feeling of cool water on the face. One must simply do it to comprehend.

It starts with a certain level of focus. It starts from an empty mind and with the slightest twisting of the finest threads of essence. This must be woven with the care of a true master and yet it is not a gentle, cautious exploration. There is a battle to be waged for control, for essence as its core is only an eager servant to those of skill. The first flows are those along the body. They come easiest.

It is an exhausting process, and it is not a fast one. Egress focuses herself again and again, learning how to not only control the webs of essence to begin the charm itself, but also how to change the very lattice of her own being to allow the powers of another to enter her. It is not something she can learn alone. Only with the help of Ma-Ha-Suchi can she do more than just form the well inside herself, but at least draw something into it. The failures are disastrous, both exhausting and in some cases, painful, but neither Solar nor Lunar will tolerate failure. Bleeding, worn from lack of sleep under sun and moon, they press on, knowing that the gifts of Leviathan are not to be ignored for a moment.

Egress has also been party to Ma-Ha-Suchi's attempts, and failures. The technique he is learning is some advanced technique of shapeshifting, and he frequently adopts shapes that seemingly have no earthly source. His scroll calls it the Magnificent Beast-God Transformation, and Egress can sense the power of it from time to time when she takes a break.

At the end of it, though, the elder Lunar has mastered this forgotten skill. And as Egress watches, he demonstrates it.

From his human form, Ma-Ha-Suchi rapidly metamorphoses into the wolf-goat hybrid which is his trademark - the Deadly Beastman Transformation. His muscles bulge and ripple under the fur, and his fangs are deadly sharp. His talons could rend through folded steel. Yet there is still more. He invokes his Charm, surrounding himself in a violently-shivering aura of silvery white light. For a moment it engulfs him completely. And from this cocoon of the moon, something new steps forth.

A taloned foot touches down on the soil, embedding its spikes into the earth. Monstrously large, it is shown to be in proportion when the twelve-foot torso of Ma-Ha-Suchi himself emerges as well. His head has blended his human features into that of the wolf, and he is strikingly, disturbingly beautiful for it. His shoulders and torso are impossibly muscular, and his arms seem as though they could rip treetrunks from the earth with ease. Folded bird's wings nestle against his back, and his eyes glow a brilliant silver.

Egress watches the transformation with awe, seeing the revealed might of the Lunar in an even purer state. She can't help but be grateful he did not have this knowledge when she faced him. It is clear that he has mastered the use of Leviathan's gift. She wonders if she has done as well.

"Now." Leviathan speaks again, the first time he has done so in nearly a dozen days. He speaks another word. "_Gattai!_" Egress watches as Ma-Ha-Suchi approaches. His body shifts, melding like water, pouring over and around her. He is engulfing her, but not drowning her. More like... merging with her.

In moments, Egress sees herself looking out from new eyes, wearing a new body. She still feels herself inside, but she has joined with something else. The wings on her back are hers to command now, and her own Solar gifts are Ma-Ha-Suchi's to employ.

"Sun and Moon together," Leviathan explains. "Fight like this. You will be unstoppable."

It is something that at first, seems utterly alien. Yet somehow, Egress feels like she's done something not so different before. She's not sure how, but this is right. The feeling of love she had for Ma-Ha-Suchi seems to fade, as curious as it is, and is replaced now with something more fitting. A sense of fellowship. With the gift of Leviathan, they are indeed in this together, and are bound in a way that is stranger and more powerful than Egress has experienced before.
