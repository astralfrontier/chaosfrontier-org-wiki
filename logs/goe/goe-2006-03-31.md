# Gods of Eden 2006-03-31

Ramar's mind reels. The flight to Yu-Shan afforded him a glimpse of all Creation beneath his eyes. He can still remember glimpses of the world; his friends battling against the armies of the Realm, the world shaking with the chaos of the fight. There's more too, but it's only half-remembered, as though a dream upon waking. Fire. Shadows. Shadows at the edge of the world drawing in close...

_Time. There is precious little of it now._ Voices not his own call out to him. Even Yu-Shan has felt the effects of the battle on the Blessed Isle. Ramar hurries off of the platform and into the Celestial City. An aerial rickshaw awaits him. He's expected. He is brought to the Golden Barque of The Heavens where the Fisher awaits him. "I know why you've come... these are dangerous times. Go carefully and bring this with you." The Sidereal holds up a small golden coin with a seal imprinted on it. "It might help others find an excuse to acknowledge what you have to say."

Within the Barque itself, there are many who listen to the Solar's hurried plea. The urgency in his own voice and the reports they've been getting from the other bureaus lend much weight to his request. It is not long after he leaves that the word has been passed along to the highest officials... and soon after that, harried figures make their way into the streets of Yu-Shan.

The Crimson Panoply of Victory is... alive. The chaos of the bureaucracy at work is especially apparent as functionaries and diplomats hurry past. Here, the Fisher's seal grants him the briefest of audiences, but it is enough. In his wake, others soon follow-Gods and their functionaries left troubled by what he had to say.

Within the Cerulean Lute of Harmony, Ramar finds his words welcomed. Relief at the Solar's presence is palpable, and there is little trouble convincing the higher officials to come and listen to him. Indeed, aides are sent to the other bureaus, heralding the coming of the Solar who begins to walk the path of the Deliberative.

Wayang the Black Puppet Mask awaits him outside of the Violet Bier of Sorrows. Around him the very air itself seems to grow still and words die out. Gestures and looks are exchanged, and as Ramar waits, wondering if he's done this properly, a scroll falls into his hand. _Much is happening in Creation. Many endings are at hand today. I will go, and those who should listen to you shall be there as well._

The Forbidding Manse of Ivy... little can be said of what transpired within. Ramar has only vague recollections of speaking to officials behind masks as plain and featureless as the one given to him by the Maiden of Secrets. Nonetheless, when he stands in address to the gods of Yu-Shan, this bureau has its own representatives there.

There is a clearing in one of the streets of Yu-Shan. It is lined with golden light that reflects off of the walls of Adamant. Ramar stands in the center, amazed at the number of beings who have come to hear him speak. The image of shadows around the world and his friends struggling against them flashes in his mind. His resolve grows. He wastes little time with pleasantries, simply referring to the assembled crowd as Honored Ones. "I have come here because of what is happening in Creation. The armies that now fight on the Blessed Isle shall finish their battle soon. The fate of the Realm is at hand. I have come here to find the Ring of the Deliberative. It is a symbol of the First Age, a symbol of Order even amidst the chaos of the Wyld. When the dust settles around the Blessed Isle, it can be looked to as a guidepost, as a sign of what should come... lest the Realm crumble to ashes and a new order establish itself on its dust. You have seen it have you not? Shadows lurking at the edge of the world, wa

"Shadows lurking at the egde of the world, waiting for this moment."

He continues speaking, and as he speaks, it becomes clear how important a strong deliberative will be in the times to come. Egress is in his mind and heart as he speaks, and her courage, her strength flows through him, giving his words qualities he would never have thought himself to possess. As he speaks he sees... sees how the Circle has changed him, and how much he must do. "I have been beyond the edges of the world. I have bled the blood of the Dragons, and soon I shall bear the scars of hell. I do this willingly. I know it is much to ask for... but I believe that I should bear the Chop of Heaven."

"Your Deliberative is making war against the Blessed Isle!" shouts a god. "You are causing chaos!" cries another. "These are not the works of harmony between Heaven and Earth!" call still more. Others shout their fellows down, and waves of interwoven chatter flow from the throng.

"They are," speaks Ramar. His voice is loud and carries far. His hands are outstretched to try and calm the throng, "To create harmony between Heaven and Earth the Scarlet Dynasty must be changed. The Dragons' children are doing that which they were never meant to, they are out of balance with their station. I agree, this war must be stopped. I believe that the Ring shall give both sides something to look to. It will remind them of what has come before, and remind them that there must be something left to come after. It can show them how there can be harmony between Heaven and Earth!"

"And what of the Deathlords? And the demon hordes? They will come for you when you are weak!" This cry is echoed and amplified by the cheers of a small faction of spirits. "You propose to brave Malfeas, _now_?"

"Then let us show them that we have the strength of both Creation AND Yu-Shan behind us. Let them see what has been lost for so long..." Ramar adresses the faction of spirits. "Yes. I do. It is what I must do if I am to retrieve this... if I am to bring an end to this war before too much harm is done to both sides."

When Ramar speaks, the strength of his Circle is behind his words. Together they have endured many things. In a way, they are with him even now, and it is this that leaves his voice devoid of fear.

This time, no spirits or Sidereals step out to address the host in defense of the Solars. There is no longer a need for such things. The Chosen of the Unconquered Sun have found their voice and their cause.

The throng erupts again. On either side there are many arguments to be made... coupled with the fact that high officials from every bureau of Heaven are assembled... needless to say they are all intent on having their voices heard. Ramar watches as the various factions begin fracturing, splitting further and further as each god, sidereal, or other heavenly being begins to reel beneath the sheer volume of opinions. But then, Ramar is an Eclipse. This too is what he was meant for.

It starts with a moment taken to follow the ebb and flow of argument as one opinion seems to take hold over another. _It's almost like sailing._ Ramar steps into the various debates easily, and at times he merely gives both sides a common foe to rally against. In other cases his point of view, or his support for an opinion is enough to bring the debates to a close. It is a slow and subtle process at first, but soon the avalanche has started and all of the fighting, all of the bickering shall be consumed and silenced when it has ended.

Common ground is the first thing to begin to surface. Heated words turn to dying embers as the arguments grow to their ends. It is agreed that the deathlords and the demonic hordes are a threat that soon cannot be ignored. It is generally agreed that Ramar is mad for attempting this. It is agreed that Creation will need strong leaders, and that the backing of Yu-Shan will be necessary if any of this is to succeed.

Old rivalries hold fast, though. Gold and Bronze have been divided for ages, and their allies among the spirits are hesitant to act in a way that will lose them the favor of their patrons. It is here that Ramar finds more difficulty in bringing about consensus. Many of them are afraid. Change is at hand and for the longest time, none have known anything but the internecine political war between the two factions. The Eclipse realizes this, and has argued on behalf of both sides. It becomes clear that all voices can be heard... but that if they are to go on being heard a decision must be reached.

Around him the bickering and arguing become calmer and calmer. It is almost like watching the eye of a storm grow larger until it swallows the tempest that formed it.

In due course Ramar observes a sight which has not been witnessed in an age. It is called the Prayer of the Seal, and it is performed by seven Sidereals of the five Castes, including the Priestess and the Storyteller. It is a ritual invocation to a sleeping god, performed over a heavy jade slab.

At the end of eighteen hours, Ramar beholds the shifting sigils of Essence which begin to illuminate the slab. He sees the characters spelling out 'Heaven and Earth in Harmony under the Exalted' written there. He is seeing the chop of Heaven.

"By the authority of this insignia do you act," the Storyteller intones in the final moments of the ritual. And when it has finished, the nascent Sidereal grins. "Now go to hell."

Dawn rises. The Seventeenth day of Resplendent Water finds a banner waving above the Imperial City that has not been seen in an age. The banners of the Unconquered Sun have replaced all others, mingled here and there with the great symbols of the houses that have rallied to the cause, as well as the winged lion of Egress and the starburst of General Dace. The city lies firmly in the hands of the Celestials now, and still more forces are arriving every hour to aid her in the battles to come.

Though this first, vital battle has been a success much remains to be decided. The one who would be Empress turns her will to the people, and with the very power of her personality wins over every mortal who hears her words. There is no need to drive the people to immediately reclaim their lives and rebuild what is damaged, they do so on their own.

All such efforts would be in vain, however, were it not for the aid of Marina and the many gifted Solars who have come to make a name for themselves in the service of this great cause. Disorder is smashed more swiftly than any can imagine. The Dragon Blooded who have seen the city in peace are taken aback and once again left in awe of the unbelievable powers of their new lords.

At the center of all this is the one whom they whisper of. Many say she is to be the Empress, to lead the Realm to a greater glory than it has ever seen. Those same voices just days before had spoken of her in fear, as the dread queen of the east, coming to devour all life. Yet where she goes, there is nothing but life.

What little sleep Egress gets is only at the urging of Marina and Dace, for she herself seems tireless, paying no mind to the details of eating and sleeping. The Unconqured Sun has awoken in her a greater fire than ever before. At a glance His strength can be seen. Most of the time she moves about with only two friends. Of course, that is but illusion. Every shadow holds one of her allies, and often spirits will materialize about her, bearing messages for her ears alone.

Egress has grown somehow. With her gentle words and soft songs waves of inspiration pour from her and engulf first the city, and then beyond. Her personality, her strength and calm certainty inspire even the jaded Dragon Blooded. To all she gives hope, and where she goes all stop to listen, for after her voice enters their minds they find a clarity. Craftsman find new visions in their minds, artisans find new ways to express themselves, and the seasons soldiers feel a thrill of energy and excitement in their hearts.

Still, they are not sure if they should speak to this woman who would be Empress. As lovely as her words are and as much as they thirst to hear her songs, the people are wary. This, too, is swiftly overcome. The children ignore their parents, and they seek out Egress as she stops to visit the small garden of an old woman whose sons both fell in the battle. Though they stood against her, Egress is moved and with her voice alone brings life to the withering plants with soft words, and all this the children see. Entranced, they speak to her, and find her to be gentle and caring. The calloused hands of the Zenith brush hair out of the eyes of a small girl, then straighten the collar of a young man who promises that one day he shall be her knight, and her smile makes it clear. These are her people now.

Davron has seen many battlefields by now, and although he has come to enjoy the use of his skills in battle, in both the building and use of engines of war... when the battle is over, he cannot bring himself to call victory 'glorious'. Necessary at times - and those times have been frequent indeed - but there is no glory in a battlefield strewn with corpses.

Not from his perspective, at least. But Davron knows - as, indeed, does any Exalt with more than a little knowledge of the occult - that there are others with a different opinion, who find the aftermath of battle to be as sweet, as appealing to mind and soul, as he himself would find a field of honeysuckle. And the spilling of vast amounts of blood upon the Blessed Isle itself will surely draw the attention of the Deathlords and their servants.

When many men die, in a short space of time, their dying Essence can weaken the barriers that separate Creation from the Underworld. With enough pressure, especially when helped along by the servants of Oblivion, this weakening can blossom into a shadowland. And every shadowland that might form in the wake of these titanic battles would be a portal for the armies of Oblivion to breach the defenses of Creation and claim the Blessed Isle from both the children of the Dragons and the Unconquered Sun alike.

It is the New Deliberative who began this war, or at least who were the first to move their forces. And so it was their responsibility, far more than the Realm's, to be prepared.

Thus it is, then, that Davron stands, his bow at the ready, by the side of Panther as he walks the battlefield, using the gifts that the Unconquered Sun has given him to cleanse the bodies of the slain with holy fire, to send their spirits to Lethe. Davron does not stand alone, though it might seem so; he knows that somewhere, not far away, Havesh the Vanisher is patrolling unseen.

In addition, another man stands nearby, the green cast to his features and the ornate garments marking him respectively as a scion of the Dragon of Wood and a sorcerer of Lookshy. And though he would help against an attack if it were vitally necessary, he has a different task to perform this day.

Others of Panther's caste work the battlefields as well, with their Circle-mates, other Solars, and anyone else who can be spared stand guard over them. For though it uses but a little of the Zenith's energy to cleanse one body, the sheer unimaginable number of the dead is a severe drain on the reserves of the Resplendent Suns; and the slaying of Chejop Kejak at the last Carnival was a chilling reminder that traitors of Creation lurk everywhere. While the Golden Bulls are vulnerable, their comrades must protect them from assasins.

Shortly after midday, Panther stops to rest. He glows with a brightness to rival his patron, the energy that he expended in purifying the dead surrounding him in coruscating brilliance; as he drops into the lotus position on the ground to meditate, he comments to Davron, "I hope you've got something else in mind. Doing it all this way is going to take forever."

Davron nods. "Of course," he says. "Even with your efforts and those of your comrades, all these deaths will still leave their effect. We have other ways of anchoring this land against..." The Twilight is interrupted by a sudden dimming, as a shadow passes over the sun. "Ah, right on schedule," says Davron.

As the shadow deepens, he nods to the Wood-aspected sorcerer that has accompanied them. "Ready, Kuroko?" The man from Lookshy nods, and begins to focus his concentration... and in that moment, the three Exalts are aware of a soft pattering sound.

The sound is oddly like an approaching rain shower; and to the southeast, the dust begins to stir just as if struck by rain. When the rainfall draws closer, though, it is not drops of water that fall from the sky, but seeds, their wings slowing their descent enough that their hulls will not shatter as they are cast from the edges of Ranapura.

It is not until the seedfall ceases and Ranapura passes on, leaving the sun to shine upon the earth again, that Davron nods to Kuroko. "Now," he says. And the Dragon-Blood is surrounded by glowing runes as he draws forth the power granted him by his initiation... and as he makes the final gesture, a gentle glow washes over the earth in an expanding circle... a glow which is sucked in hungrily by the scattered seeds.

As the three watch, the seeds split apart, white tendrils of roots burrowing into the ground while green vines emerge above, slender creepers spreading out in all directions as leaf after pair of green leaf bursts forth to drink in the sunlight. And at last, green buds begin to swell, reaching toward heaven on waving stems. And then, in a soundless explosion of color, the crimson blossoms open, surrounding the trio with a carpet of green and red. Elsewhere, other sorcerers perform the same miracle, channeling their energy to drive the seeds to a full season of growth in a scant handful of seconds.

"The Summoning of the Harvest," whispers Kuroko, smiling in satisfaction at a job well done. "Lifeweed," adds Davron. "It will remind this land that it is alive, anchor it to the world of the living." The Deathlords find it hard going to drag this battlefield into the Underworld in the face of this.

When darkness comes to the Imperial City, it is not feared, for this night the guard is restored and the new masters of the city stand strong. The enemy still reels from the blow, having paid dearly for their defense. On this strangely quiet night Egress goes forth from the city to meet with Ma-Ha-Suchi and the other Lunar champions who have come to war. Egress also has called upon the Priestess and the Fisher to help guide her. She does not tell them what she wishes to speak of on this night, for the war council was not to take place until the early morning hours.

Her desires are simple. She wishes to end this war with a gesture of absolute authority. She speaks of the Imperial Manse, and a hush comes to the room. "I have heard it said that the Empress took the manse and thus solidified her rule beyond all challenging, and with its power held back the enemies of Creation," says Egress. "The enemies are even now moving against us. This I know without hearing the tale of the stars. We must strike back against them and shatter their power before it threatens all that we are working for."

The gathered Celestials nod, murmuring amongst themselves. The Fisher finally speaks. "If any have memory of its secrets, it would be the Storyteller - the Steersman's soul must now speak to him."

The Priestess nods. "I will send word that he come. In the meantime, there may be other action we can take."

"What do you suggest?" asks Egress. "Anything we can do to move forward and save lives will meet with my approval. Above all, we must move quickly, however. I have a feeling that Deathlords know all too well exactly what we are doing, and I imagine the Fair Folk are unlikely to be completely ignorant for long."

"I have no specific ideas, right now. I would speak to the historians who keep the record of the Scarlet Empress's reign."

"Then let them be called on to speak to us," replies Egress. "I imagine that they will forgive us for rousing them so late, considering the importance of the work."

It is midway through the 'conversation' with the historians - a timid and cowardly lot, natural given their particular profession in this empire - that the Storyteller arrives. He encounters Egress and the others in one of the beautifully-decorated, high-ceilinged vaults.

The history is convoluted, but Egress has unlocked the 'Red Scrolls' - as true an account of the proceedings of the Empress's early reign as anyone's likely to get.

Even so, a faint trail at best is all that emerges, and the Priestess and Fisher confer with their new colleague at length as Egress receives the deposition of the historians.

The issue at hand is that the Red Scrolls contain only what the Empress herself recorded. Whatever truths she retained are hers and hers alone, and no magic the group can easily wield will recover those.

The Storyteller has more to add, but not much more. In the end, Egress learns the following: the Empress entered the Imperial Manse during a time of conflict. With her were four companions. All perished under differing circumstances, and it is widely held as true that she deliberately sacrificed one of them. Whether or not this was a geas of the Manse or a reflection of her character is not clear. The Storyteller does not yet feel confident passing judgement on a woman he has never met, and so declines to opine.

"So we must guess, and those who go with me are likely to die," says Egress softly. She rubs at her forehead, letting out a sigh. "I would never want to ask that of anyone, and yet.. is there anything more important now than stopping the Death Lords? Can we even find out the names of those who went with the Empress? Perhaps we might learn something from that, though I have a feeling the truth is hidden deep, indeed."

What little the Red Scrolls have to add is that the Manse spoke to her, and treated her as an invader, or hostile force. She also speaks of the lesser defenses as "dangerous to anyone less than our Talon", suggesting that the Solars may safely penetrate the outermost layers of the Manse without significant risk.

Egress reads these things and looks quite thoughtful. "We are going about this all the wrong way. Let us consult the Book of Three Circles. Let us turn to our true, right history and see what we might learn of the Manse that belongs not to the Dragon Blooded usurpers, but to the greatest of the Chosen."

Nobody dared bring the Book to the Blessed Isle in time of war. However, the Book is not of substantially greater use after Infallible Messenger is used to speak with Sun-and-Moon and Erisus, in Denandsor.

It seems that the Imperial Manse's secrets were the right of the Guardian to hold, and those secrets were lost when Meru was.

Egress tries another approach. "What were the symbols of authority of Deliberative. Was there anything other than the marks we bear as Chosen to distinguish us? Was there any other symbol that might serve as a key to the Imperial Manse? Is there any discussion about those who went to the manse? Any rituals associated with it?" She is perhaps grasping at straws, but she has this doubt that simply being Solar is enough.

"We will speak." The voice is sudden, abruptly making itself known to those in the room. The more junior Exalts jump visibly at the sound of it, while the elders grow paranoid and wary of expression. Egress recognizes it as the voice of Sa, the ancient Solar who rules the southern demon-city of Kish.

"Come." Sa's disembodied voice speaks, and the room swirls with mist, growing hazier and hazier by the second. The terrified scholar-historians tremble, while the three Sidereals present frown. When the fog clears, Egress finds herself looking at Sa's three forms, reclining on comfortable chairs in a library. "Sit," one of them suggests.

Egress does as she is told, settling in a chair and looking to the aspects of Sa. "It has been some time since I have heard your voice, Sa, and yet I have often thought of you," she says. "I hope this meeting will help me save Creation, my friend."

Sa nods to the others in turn. One of him rises, pouring a drink from a decanter made of jade. The others stay put. Each of him speaks in turn. "You speak of the Imperial Manse. I knew of it when the seal on the Red Scrolls were broken." One of him smiles at the scholars, who now look intrigued. "The seal that was used by the Empress to seal them shut was of my design. She was unaware of its full uses." He takes a drink.

"The Imperial Manse is a weapon," he continues. "Its purpose is the taking of lives in the name of the Solar Empire. As a tool of war, it must not be used lightly. Those who will enter it must be prepared to die, but also to kill."

"There are five layers. They are in order of the Solar Exaltation Castes. Each evokes a Caste's bailiwick - the Dawn is physical traps and hazards, and so forth."

"Beyond this, I cannot say specifically what to expect. The Imperial Manse is alive, you see. It changes itself. It speaks to intruders, and to its master. It is like the Book, in that regard."

"So we must get inside, and then.. whatever happens, happens," says Egress. She sighs and stares off for a time, looking at nothing. "What must be done, I will do. For Creation, some risks must be taken. I only hope that this will save lives. We need a weapon that can defeat the Deathlords, and I can think of nothing more powerful to use against them than the Imperial Manse. I also believe that we are not the only ones considering this path."

"There's just one decision which you _must_ make," says Sa quietly. "Who will go, knowing that you may take the life of one yourself."

"I do not know," answers Egress. "I will have to think on it. Perhaps in this case, there is no good answer. Perhaps it is time to turn to the Enigma, and accept what guidance she might give us in the absence of all fact and reason. Who shall come and who she stay.. I do not like knowing that I am leading someone to their certain death."

"Isn't that what you do when you involve yourself in a war?" Sa asks.

"In war, a man may survive by skill and chance," says Egress. "In this, it seems that someone is being killed beyond any hope. It feels different, no matter how it might have the same result. Still, what must be done, must be done. I don't see any other weapon that could possibly hold the Deathlords at bay, and I can't imagine them hesitating to claim the manse if they have a chance."

"When wielding weapons, death is the same result, no matter how it feels," says Sa, severely. "That is the lesson of the Imperial Manse. Do not go ignorant of this fact."

"So be it," answers Egress. "I must go. The time has come. No handful of lives can balance the scales against the weight of all Creation."

Sa smiles grimly. "Yes. That, too, is the lesson of the Manse."
