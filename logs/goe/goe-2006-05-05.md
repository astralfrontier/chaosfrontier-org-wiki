# Gods of Eden 2006-05-05

Many years have passed without open war in the Realm. The people had come to think it was something that happened in foreign lands, bringing glory and wealth to the island. Now, war has come home, and families are torn asunder by the relentless tide of battle. The powers of Mnemon have turned to cunning and guile, doing what they can to destroy the popularity of their foe. Still, there are many battles ahead, for the followers of the old guard will not surrender ground without a dear cost.

Propoganda engines churn on both sides, but in this, the Solars are proving more powerful than the Dragon Blooded can hope to match. The raw presence of Egress has caused cracks to form in her enemies, but her own allies are also at time divided. It is hard to measure ground in this battle, as both sides have so many subtle shifts, yet the pattern is clear. The Solars are advancing.

The battle is fought slowly, and deliberately. The aim of Egress is to claim land without completely destroying the lives of the people of the Realm. As the weeks pass, what is solidly in the hands of the Solars grows steadily, and the sign of war passes slowly from those places. So that the first to fall, find their cities rebuilt at least as well as they had been before, and their lost are buried peacefully.

Yet none can deny that much has been lost. Thousands upon thousands are dead, and there are so many orphans that it is hard for those who remain to tend them, even with the skill of the Solars and their allies. Even the best reasons for this war do not help ward off the nightmares that Egress confronts more and more frequently. A blow must be struck. A final, ultimate victory must be brought to pass. There is only one answer. She sees it in her dreams and knows a fear she has not felt before. It is the Imperial Manse, the mightiest weapon in Creation.

Yet the Realm is only the center of a greater battlefield. The Deathlords have awakened with their full wrath, and turmoil is everywhere. The misery of the Realm is far less than that in many other lands, where there are fewer forces to defend them. This, too, wears on the minds of those trying to take the Realm. The power of the Lunars and the Solars are stretched very thin. War is everywhere, and if anything, it is spreading. There are hints and rumors that at the very edges of Creation, even stranger things than normal are occuring. There is activity that has not been seen in many years. Warnings are sent every day from those Lunars who stand nearest the whirling madness of the Wyld. The dreadful of Creation has not gone unnoticed by those outside.

---

Far beneath the cool waters of the West, Ramar waits. Deep within the heart of his Sanctum, all his mind, all his energies are turned inward. His focus is on the Essence within his own body, nurturing it, tending to it, gathering it together. The Spark of divinity hums within him, and as the world goes by far above the waves, he slowly begins to stretch his thoughts outward.

Once he begins to understand even further the Essence at the core of his being, and how it relates to his meditation chamber, he expands this understanding outward. Now he begins to perceive his Essence and the soft whispers of Essence that flow through his Manse. A month has passed now, since he first retreated to the solace of his sanctum, and he has become aware of many things. Though he seldome leaves his chamber, he begins to hear the soft whispers of the currents as they bring news from across Creation.

Slowly, he begins to channel Essence outward, back along these currents. A month passes. An old sailor, weathered beyond measure, hears a voice among the waves that seems to murmur about the approaching storm. A man washes up on the Southern coastline, though he had been lost in the North. Ramar breathes. No longer is it merely still air within his Sanctum, he can feel every charge of Essence, how his own will creates the softest, almost undetectable stirring where he sits. Now that he has prepared himself fully, he begins to gather his strength. _The seed is sown, the roots are set, it is time to prepare for growth._

Over the next month, he gathers Essence within and around him, and listens to the whispers of the deep as they bring to him secrets long forgotten, buried beneath them. It is now that he turns his thoughts to the demon he must channel. If he is to challenge her and win, then he must know his enemy completely. He must understand every facet of the Spinner's soul, every last crack, every last detail. Guided by the book and his conversation with Sa and spirits that he has called to him, Ramar learns everything about the Spinner. When at last Calibration approaches, he stands, the weight of an eternity falls from his body, and when at last his muscles have stopped protesting, he stands in complete and utter stillness. "I am ready."

---

Davron has also been preparing to help Ramar in his task. One of the elements of traditional demon summoning is the summoning cage, a ritual space prepared in such a way as to enhance and support the binding ritual. Normally such a cage is built to handle a wide variety of demons and elementals with provisions made for a few summoning-specific reagents, sacrificial elements, and other such minutiae. However, given that a Circle of Solars younger than a mortal's lifetime is preparing to attempt something previously only tried by elder Solars, they must obtain every advantage they can.

What Davron is building is a summoning cage specific to the Spinner. He scours Creation for the teeth of rare and wondrous beasts, so that they may line the inner circle, a gaping maw prepared to clasp the Spinner in its jaws. He spends hours forging orichalcum and starmetal inlays for binding sigils that would normally be drawn the day of the summoning. Though his researches are perhaps not as deep or as broad as Ramar's, he nevertheless spares no expense, and spends every moment he can devote to the project, in making an artifact that, barring unforeseen circumstances, will only be used once. But that once is vital to the survival of Creation, and it is worth the cost many times over.

The result is truly fearsome. Brass and gold struts like the ribs of some great beast arch over the central pillar, and braziers with grotesque faces line the perimeter, waiting to be lit with ritual fuels. A separate dais has a commanding view of the central circle, waiting for Ramar to take his position, while slabs of granite provide cover for the various Exalts who are prepared to try to banish the Spinner, in the unfortunate event that Ramar is unable to bind her will.

The power of Egress is not in making constructs or in performing great magic. Her power is in those she has inspired to loyalty, to friendship. The advice of her closest advisors is incomplete, but it is enough of a guide to make her selections. She will provide Ramar with the aid of Rumika and Samea, the most powerful sorcerors, and moreso, the Key of Mastery, a hearthstone that will aid him in this most difficult and dangerous undertaking. In addition to this, she calls upon the greatest of Lunar Warriors to stand guard, ready to fight-and die-should the terrifying power of the demon break free. For this high honor, there is no shortage of volunteers.

Calibration. The time when all of Creation realigns itself, when the cracks of the Yozis' prison grow weaker and more powerful creatures can be called through the cracks. In the First Age, most Sorcerors would come together during this time, so that none would be tempted to call upon this terrible power. And now, the Sorcerors have come together to do exactly that. Ramar stands upon the dais, overlooking the central circle. In the hours before Sunset, herbs and incense are prepared. The braziers are filled with their fuels, and the room itself has been sanctified by the answered prayers of those present.

As Ramar focuses his will on the cage, he begins to perceive the geomantic energies as they are affected by the presence of so many Exalts. The signal to begin is given, and the braziers are lit, and soon the smell of incense fills the room. Ramar begins channeling Essence. The first telltale sign is that of the smoke curling in the air... bent into the sigils of the laws of the pact that bind the Yozis. The light from Ramar's anima fills the room, though there is another light present here as well. At the edges of the room, in the shadows cast by the Sun's triumphant light is another light, a darker, green light.

Around that circle is nothing short of the most powerful assemblage of Silver Pact and Solar Warriors since the First Age. Standing at their head is Leviathan, mightiest of all living Exalts. At his right is Egress, and at his left Ma-Ha-Suchi. The Lunars all wear the guise of their beastforms, so that their terrible power is even more openly displayed. More stand ready behind these warriors, all ready to die. All knowing that should the will of the Solar fail, their death is all but assured. Yet there are still more. Sidereal masters of their supernatural martial arts, hand-picked Spirits and Gods of great wrath, armed in a myriad of ways. The enemies of the Deathlords are countless, and all here know that this is the only stage of the battle they can aid in. They all stand ready. Ready to live and die for the very existance of Creation.

There is turbulence in the air. The smoke from the incense is all but burned away as terrible energies begin to cascade through the circle of binding. The ground itself shakes as Essence flows through Creation and into Malfeas. There is a soft hum through the air, the sound of a far off wind blowing through a desert. It grows louder, into a howl, and a sickly wind courses through the cage as Creation and Malfeas begin to grow more alike with one another. Even shadows seem to slink back... though Ramar seems to stand firm in the face of this energy. Around him the air is more calm... and he seems somehow more alive. _It's time. Time to blossom. Time to turn my face to the Sun and grow._

Throughout night energy is channeled through the cage. Creation and Malfeas are linked through a terrible synergy between the two realms. Midnight falls and Ramar strikes the Dais he stands upon, sending a lash of power into the center of the circle. He does this five times. Once for the Maidens, once for Luna, once for the Unconquered Sun. A fourth for Gaia, and the last... the one whose sound fills the room with an unholy cry as the ground itself tears open to allow the demon through... that one for those locked in Malfeas.

Through the crack the demon comes, bathed in wrath and hatred. Some fool has dared to tear it into this Realm, and now many shall pay for this ignorance. But... there is something different. Everything, all the power that Ramar has been gathering for months, bolstered by the efforts of his friends, seems to coalesce. "Demon, you will find I am a foe you cannot overcome. I have prepared for your arrival, I have mastered secrets that even you have not learned. I know your soul, every facet of it, I know your function, your form, your strengths... and I know how to use these things against you. You will find no hold over me, and will do as you are asked." Ramar speaks these words patiently, with a slow, rhythmic cadence to them. The rhythm of Life.

And as he speaks, Ramar can feel the seed of power sown long ago begin to bloom.

There is a terrible cry from the demon as wills collide. In the center of the circle is a mist... a blood colored mist... no, blood colored threads of silk upon which spiders made of mist crawl endlessly, spawning their young and living and dying all in the course of seconds. This cycles endlessly, each time the threads take a new shape as directed by these mist-spiders. As Ramar begins to gain the upper hand, there is a change, and where the mist of spiders was, now there is a fierce and terrible spider, whose webs flow endlessly... and then finally, when Ramar wins... and the demon's head is bowed... there is only a tall woman, wearing soft robes composed entirely of spiders.

Ramar stands before the demon and speaks his request simply. "You will take me safely through your realm and over the mouth of the well of Oblivion, where the webs of the pattern spiders lay in waiting. You will grant me the Eight Feet that I may walk upon them, and retrieve the Names, and then you will bear me back here."

While the assembled Celestial heroes watch, countless threads fly from the Weaver's body. They surround Ramar, engulfing him, swallowing him into a cocoon which shrinks in size as it is pulled back toward her - and into her body. And with a mighty laugh, a creature who has not been bound in more than two millennia vanishes.

---

Ramar finds the experience of webwalking to be disorienting but manageable. Rather than striding across geographic features of the land, he and the Weaver are scuttling over the threads of Fate itself.

He feels the 'ground' beneath his feet. An old sort of foundation at first, which he guesses to be the foundations of the plan to topple the Great Prophecy. He walks on stranger threads, the divergent fates of the conspirators. He feels some of these sink into an oily murk or residue as the ghosts of the Solars become the Deathlords, beholden to the stars of the Underworld.

In time the two come to a deep blackness which is the herald of the true horror ahead - Oblivion itself. Ramar can feel things seeping past him - thoughts, hopes, sounds, noises, drops of blood, tree leaves, lovers' promises. Things real and unreal are slowly pouring into the ultimate abyss, and he is facing it.

Though he has been to many places before and done many things... nothing could prepare him for walking upon the threads of Fate like this... he slowly begins to fathom what this means and then Oblivion itself awaits him. As things pour into the ultimate abyss he watches them, his memory of them their last link to anything perhaps, and he worries... for what is to stop more and more things from seeping in... and as he draws closer to Oblivion he turns his thoughts back to the task ahead. In the face of such overwhelming emptiness... his mind must remained focused, though it is difficult to think of continuing... he must.

Some semblance of sight, sound, and other senses returns. Ramar finds himself in a hollow nest. It is built on the side of a cliff which extends to the left and to the right into infinity. Below and above it falls away into darkness. The only thing staving off the pitch-black of his surroundings are eight red eyes and glowing filaments, both of which belong to the owner of the nest.

It is a pattern-spider, one of the automata crafted by Autochthon for the management of destiny. It clicks and chitters slowly. Ramar looks out along the length of the filaments it holds onto. Out there, at the end of the threads, restrained only by this engine of destiny, are what he seeks.

The threads remain taut; Oblivion is the source of the tension. Now Ramar must climb them. And he must not fall off.

Ramar begins to climb them. His gaze is focused on the spider until he has stepped out over the mouth of Oblivion... and then he focuses on the threads themselves. He walks patiently, and with each step he imagines his foot taking root deep within the thread. As he walks, he feels the fates of the conspirators, of their last moments before they became the Deathlords, of those who bound themselves to this task... and there are their names. Just a few more steps... just a few more steps.

The pull becomes such that even walking will no longer suffice, or Ramar is certain he will be pulled off.

Ramar drops to his hands and his knees, gripping the threads held by the pattern spider with all his might. He slides back, the pull of Oblivion nearly taking its hold, but he catches himself. And begins to move. Slowly. He finds himself holding his breath, wary of making even the slightest unnecessary disturbance.

Behind him, in an unexpected shock for such a forsaken place, Ramar hears a voice. "Well, well," purrs the Princess Magnificent, standing haughtily beside the pattern spider in its nest. "The spider's web catches flies after all."

---

"It's our turn," says Egress flatly. Ramar's departure was more sudden than she expected, yet in these matters, she has learned not to expect things to go normally. She looks to Leviathan and Ma-Ha-Suchi, but there are no words to say. They konw they have survived one danger, only to face yet another, which is likely to kill them all.

The group that shall raid the manse is not a large one. There is no army that can overcome its defenses better than a handful might. The Lunars make their choices based on honor, and in some cases, duels are nearly fought over the glory of this attempt. For the Solars, this is of course of great importance, but for the ancient Lunars, who know of the manse as more than a story of terrible wonders, it is far more.

The Lunars chosen are those Egress knows best. Ma-Ha-Suchi is the chief among them, his honor unquestioned, and his leadership of the effort that got them here beyond doubt. Sand Spider also shall come, as well as Tammuz, Lunars of great skill whose aid will doubtless be essential in reaching the manse, and more importantly, friends. Leviathan, for reasons he would not elaborate, demanded that all those who go trust each other, and respect each other. Even without explanation, none are foolish enough to doubt his advice.

From the Solars come Egress, Davron, and Koriko. Others wish to go, but are ordered away from this task. Egress' desires are heeded, though they are not loved by those forced to wait behind. None know what she shall face inside, but the youthful Solars, so full of their own powers, notice the increasingly grim attitude of the Lunars. More and more, their bravado shifts to a more serious outlook. This will not be easy, even for the righteous.

And what of the others, who go with her? Their danger is no less. Their lives would no doubt be spent first. Those who go are given a respect even by Leviathan himself, and quickly the younger exalts follow his lead, knowing only dread as their friends depart. The weakest of these hope that no way into the manse will be found, forcing the party to come back. The strongest pray that the manse will be taken. No matter the cost to those who go.

It is especially hard for Davron to appreciate the gravity of the situation. After all the fearsome challenges he has faced already, a single Manse, bound to Creation, seems like just another on the checklist. It is only when Leviathan himself shows his respect for the party that he truly begins to appreciate what he is getting into. But he did not make the decision to join lightly. He looks onward, knowing at least one heartening thing: if he dies here today, it will not be in vain, so long as he gives his fellows some greater chance of overcoming the Manse's defenses.

The Sidereals, too, will send one of their number. Coranna comes to face the peril, knowing what little is still known does little to still her thoughts. Still, she is a Sidereal, and fate depends upon her. To her, death is no particular concern. The success of the mission is all. In this, perhaps she is more like the Lunars than others might expect. With her, goes another. Wolf Brother, a Lunar who has long been her strength and protection, will not have his honor as her guardian insulted. His right to be there is not questioned.

The approval of heaven is shown in many ways. Rain of Fire shall attend Egress, as a friend. Another god comes as well. His name is Invincible, and his power is not in arms, but in defense. His might is crystalized into an armor of unbreakable essence that shields Egress more potently than any artifact. Her spear, powered now by the prayers of millions, has become more than just a dumb weapon, but is an expression of power in its own right. Armed with very power of the gods, the Heirophant is ready to lead her allies into this battle.

The march to the manse is not as difficult as it would have been months before. Armies have been directed for months with this goal in mind. The aim was not to drive towards the manse itself, but to focus on other, more practical locations, forcing the adversary to leave these roads less well defended as they face intense battle elsewhere.

The Imperial Manse is a glorious work of architecture, heralding back at least to the greatness of the Solar Deliberative, and showing an artistry that makes Egress wonder whether it was even the skill of Solars who constructed it, or some other, more ancient hands still. There are shapes there that are beyond the vision of the Zenith, and fine lines and arches that seem to defy her conceptions of geometry. It is with awe that Egress appraoches. Ahead are the doors, some thirty feet tall. These open easily, not swinging inward, but simply flowing out of the way like a dividing curtain of water. If anything, this easy entrance makes the Exalts even more wary.

The Manse's interior is dark only for a moment. Egress and the others behold a light shining from a far distance - to the east, if inside and outside directions hold any relationship to each other. The Essence currents which drift here remind Egress of the Labyrinth of Lies in Bagrash Kol's fortress. Here, however, they are infinitely more complex. This Manse can create whatever inner reality it wishes, it seems, just as a byproduct of its primary function.

A woman's voice can be heard as the faux-dawn fills the Manse with its light. "Seekers of power who have entered the Endless Manse. You will face five challenges. You have not come alone, so know this: your companions are your anchors. So long as they live on and perform their duty, you may pass within, and you may return again."

"We accept the challenge," answers Egress confidently. She steps forward, looking around at the unformed essence around her. She knows that she can offer no meaningful warning of what will be faced. She can only go forward, and trust in her friends. She has no trouble doing so. Her true power is not in weapons of war, but in the people who believe in her vision, and who risk their lives to make the world she has helped them see for themselves.

The beginning comes so quickly that Egress barely can ready herself. In between one moment and the next, she moves without any heed of time or space. The first blow is one of titanic physical focus, and this Egress sees, but does not block, casting herself into its forceful strike so that she can ride that impact into the rushing of attacks focused upon Coranna from above, Faith of the Celestials comes into being, and above her allies, Egress perceives all attacks, and in the infitesmial spaces between the beginning and end of a blink, her weapon darts out to stave away the impressive show of power that rains from above.

From the first Essence blast that erupts from the emptiness beyond, Davron realizes how much he depends on the help of his friends and allies. Even with the sorcerous protections he had put about himself - and those that had been lent to him by others - the sheer force of the attacks is incredible. Some of them simply pass him by as he writhes and leaps like a mad thing; others glance harmlessly off his Skin of Bronze, or are deflected by his golden armor.

But several times he would have been crushed but for the Virtuous Guardian of Flame lent him by a No Moon ally; and other times he is saved as his frenetic dodging takes him near one of the Lunars, and a Dolorous Reflection catches the dart and sends it winging back into the darkness. And at least a few times - once, when the backwash from a companion's parry catches him in its nimbus, and another time when a glowing boulder falls at him and all he can bring to bear is not enough - the Manse's assault gains some purchase upon his flesh. When the barrage is complete, Davron is singed and gashed - but not broken.

Even with the protection of Egress, Coranna must deal with an attack from the side. Chance and probability go wild about her, and she is simply not where she was, moving herself far enough away from the attack to blunt the impact entirely with the Razor of Propechy. At her side, Wolf Brother's powerful, purposeful parries shatter bolts of lightning, and behind him is Rain of Fire, who swallows two balls of fire before they can harm her allies.

The wild Lunars roar as the Manse lashes out at them. They respond to the attack with grim resolve. Tammuz is protected largely by the power of sorcery, which attacks the essence of the attacks arrayed against him, and he uses the force of one attack to avoid the next. What blows land on the ancient Lunar are not insignificant, but like the others around him, his regeneration will allow him to recover. The monstrous Ma-Ha-Suchi in his dreaded new form meets force with force, using his overwhelming strength to take these assaults and walk away barely bloodied at all. Sand Spider's approach is radically different, the horrifying visage of the arachnid Lunar moulding like liquid, changing so that nothing can strike him solidly, every attack glancing from him, whether it be a burst of cutting ice, teeth of essence, or even a blast of focused essence.

When the attack subsides, the woman's voice can be heard. The tone of her voice is amused as she speaks. "Your courage and dedication are thus proven. I present you with the Dawn Challenge."

The scene resolves itself to a savanna on the east. It is a wide, flat plain, grass-swept, and in the distance the group can see a bobbing tide of something moving. As it grows near, the Celestials recognize it. It is the Arczheki Horde, crazed barbarians of the southeast.

There are hundreds or thousands of them. "Challenge them and survive!" cries the voice. "But not all of you. Some must move on."

Egress surveys her enemy with disgust. She has heard of the hordes, and always imagined how terrible they must be. She is not disappointed. She turns to Ma-Ha-Suchi, nodding to him. Wordlessly he leaps forward, his dread form somehow becoming still more horrible, unspeakably terrifying as he races to face the enemy. He does not go alone. Around the form of Ma-Ha-Suchi forms Invincible, sent on by Egress, for her part lies ahead, and she knows in her heart that the powers of the god are best used here. Egress looks to Rain of Fire next, and the great dragon climbs into the sky, bursting into flames and racing towards the enemy, bringing fiery death for her foes with her.

As the others watch, the elder Lunar wades into the onrushing Horde. "Consider this a late wedding gift!" he shouts, claws swinging with contrails of Essence leaking from them. The blood of the mad barbarians stains the grass, and as it does, the directionless voice of the Manse is heard again. "Blood is the passage from this challenge to the next. Enter the spot where the grass grows crimson and we shall see how you fare."

The prospect is not precisely as easy as it might seem. Though there is certainly a great deal of blood, there are also a great deal of barbarians with very little sanity among them. Rain of Fire sees the others moving closer and soars down, letting loose a tremendous burst of incinerating breath that shatters the disordered ranks, cutting down the numbers the rest of the party shall face in a most terrible way. The stink of burnt flesh fills the air, and the foul smell of blood mingles with it. Still, Egress is no stranger to death and killing, and she leads the way, her spear and aura of awesome dread making her foes seem clumsy, their valor holding enough to not flee, but it is crippling nonetheless.

Pressing along with her is Wolf Brother, and as rear guard, Sand Spider. The Lunars have no concern for cleanliness. Those who dare to stand in their path are torn apart, the blow of a Lunar enough to tear a man in half, or if a little less accurate, remove a limb. They hold the way until the others are all through, and with a few last gestures of defiance, follow the others through that portal of blood.

The grasslands disappear. In their place, the Celestials find themselves in an endless desert. The only detail which mars the otherwise-empty sands are a series of gallows. A few quiet gasps come as the faces and details are made out. For her part, Egress sees the bloated corpse of Ramar hanging from one, rotting and putrid in the southern sun.

At first, that vision stuns Egress, and fills her with dread. Then she remembers where she is, and recalls the lies that she confronted before. "Lies," she says flatly. "This is a deceit. A mockery of what is real."

Ramar's dead eyes creak open. His voice speaks, though his mouth does not move. "Is it?" he croaks.

Egress nods, "It is." She remains rooted in herself, and the strength of her conviction grows even greater. "This place is yet another nightmare drawn from the nothingness to test our resolve. We will go on, no matter the cost." She moves closer to the body, her spear held at the ready.

"Then you will not pass this challenge," whispers the corpse hatefully. "For only by ending our unlives can you pass. And you cannot end that which you do not believe exists."

"I give you the peace you deserve, lost one," answers Egress. She raises her hand, and from her fingertips launches a burst of light even greater than that which dances around her. The power of her caste rushes forward a burst of cleansing light.

"The challenge of the Zenith is to accept the loss of that we love, to endure any despair," the Manse's voice declares. "You must face your loved ones and friends, and you must send them to rest."

As the form of Ramar is reduced to dust, Egress hesitates. "We will all die one day," she reminds herself quietly. When she looks up, she sees Jin-nu's face. And to her right, the face of Alcis, and beyond that, her father. At Egress' side, Koriko steps forward, looking forward with dread in her eyes. The Zenith is facing a terror beyond that which she has encountered before.

Yet she is not alone. Egress steps in front of Koriko and reaches out to cup her cheek, touching her gently and rousing her from the nightmare. "In time, we all must move on," she says softly. "Death is something we knew we must face. Our own death is easy to face, the escape a light one, a gentle breath. I have been beyond the veil, Koriko. There is nothing to fear there, there is no reason to dread what we must, inevitably become. Give these rest, for it is our lot to give final passage to those who are lost."

Egress sees the fear still in the eyes of her fellow Zenith and presses a soft kiss to Koriko's cheek. "You have the strength to do this. I shall give you something that shall bolster your faith, Koriko, for it has never failed me." The Heirophant draws out a small prayer strip and settles it in Koriko's hands. "This is a prayer of Kyrianna, my sister, her hopes and dreams for our world. She has passed on, yet her life goes on." Finally Egress whispers to Koriko, "I believe in you. You will do well."

Koriko answers with a smile and nods to Egress. She lets out a soft sigh and raises her hand. The same brilliant beam of radiance rushes from her hand, blasting to dust the body of what was once a lovely woman. Her cousin. "There is a time for all things," whispers Koriko. More strongly she vows, "I will not fail."

A sink-hole begins to form in the sand. It drains rapidly, and the voice speaks. "The Twilight challenge is now open to you. Descend."

As the remainder of the group files past, Koriko continues her dreadful task. This time, it is Egress who follows last. "You will do well," she repeats warmly. As she turns away, she does not see the surprise of Koriko, and she vanishes to the next challenge before she can hear the gasp. With a shaking hand, Koriko focuses her powers once more. The form she blasts away is torn in half at the waist, and only a pained moaning comes from it. It is Egress.

A pile of sand pours out the remaining Celestials. Looking about them, they perceive that they are now resting in the bottom half of an enormous hourglass. The sand is piled around their feet. And etched onto the glass are thousands of runes - arcane sigils of sorcerous significance.

"The Twilight challenge. Each rune represents a vital _atemi_, or pressure point, in the body. As a rune lights up, one of those present will begin to feel the effects of an imbalance in that pressure point." The Manse's feminine voice lets out a soft sigh. "You must strike the pressure point with your Essence to rebalance it, but you must know which one to strike."

"If you do not, you will eventually suffer the effects of the imbalance. Loss of coordination, perhaps unconsciousness, can follow if you are not cautious. Hardly fatal.. until the hourglass rotates, burying you in suffocating sand."

It is a test of lore - occult and medical knowledge, martial accomplishment, and mastery of Essence.

Egress has no wisdom in these matters, having only the lore to comprehend the vaguest meanings of the runes. Yet that comprehension is worthless if one is like her, lacking in the supporting knowledge of energy balance and bodily control. Yet this lack is not true of Coranna, nor of Wolfbrother, who has studied at her side. So long have they worked as one, that this challenge to them is a point of fascination, rather than fear. To be respected, certainly, but to be pursued as an incredible test of their lore. The two move in concert, calling upon the runes in a sequence that soon boggles Egress utterly, and she can but reflect that fate has guided her well in selecting those who come with her.

"Jump!" shouts Wolf Brother, and he and Coranna leap in time. The rest fall through the trap-door of the hourglass. The sand stays where it is. The Celestials descend into darkness again.

The Night challenge is entirely dark. Egress and Davron separately hear the Manse's voice, for they hear nothing else. "The Night challenge. You are surrounded by silence and cloaked by night. Where you have fallen is the entrance and the exit. You are separate. The challenge is this: find each other. Find the exit. Use it. And survive whatever else is here.

The faint scent of something fills the nostrils of Egress and Davron. Someone, probably one of the two Lunars, is urinating.

Egress, for her part, can do little but breathe in and focus on her other senses. She has a sense of having her feet on a surface, even if she cannot guess its shape. She prods the ground about her with her spear, and she moves in carefully measured strides, hoping to use her awesome aura to make her friends aware of her presence, though she is not sure if it will even function here. She knows that soon the Lunars will catch her scent. She wonders what else might.

Egress becomes aware of a hand gripping her wrist, unsteadily. A moment later, her unspoken question is answered: she feels the point of a knife at her back, threatening to stab her.

Davron wrinkles his nose at first, but quickly realizes the simple logic of this move. His first step is to follow suit - even if he cannot recognize the others by the scent of their urine, he'd be willing to bet his life (so to speak) that the Lunars can. Finding the pool, he makes sure to step in it with both feet, that his boots will carry the strong scent. After that... there's little he can do but walk very carefully forward, waving both hands around in large arcs. By leaving a trail, he hopes to improve the chances that the Lunars will find it; if other things find it... well, he will deal with that as best he can.

A hand wraps itself around Davron's throat, half-prepared to choke him by the feel of it. A moment later it withdraws, and the hand rests on his shoulder.

Egress does not need to see to fight, though it would certainly help. As soon as she becomes aware of that blade, her spear moves like lightning, the haft whirled behind her to slam the blade away, and the razor edge following it in a carefully-aimed slash at about thigh level.

Egress feels her weapon connect with something solid, but hears nothing more. Once again, silence reigns.

The hand on Davron's shoulder begins scratching against his bronze skin. It cannot pierce or mark, but the Twilight feels the imprint of it. Old Realm characters, spelling out a name. It is Tamuz. Or it asserts to be.

At length, even Egress feels a heavy hand on her shoulder. It scratches a word into her shoulder with a fingernail: 'Lunar'.

Davron thinks about this for a moment, and then runs his hand up along the arm holding his shoulder. His senses of scent and taste are too limited, and so he is checking for the ritual tattoos and scars that mark any Lunar - using his memory of Tamuz's appearance as a guide.

Satisfied with his inspection, Davron gently pats the hand on his shoulder again, and then clasps it. This is Tamuz, as far as he can hope to tell - and his lifeline to the rest of this world of Night.

Egress pauses thoughtfully. She needs a moment to think. She has spent hours talking to Sand Spider, and even fighting him, yet she cannot see him, nor does she know if this might be Tamuz. She reaches out to write upon the Lunar's skin, the question taking some time to form. The characters do not ask his name, but ask where they first met.

The words return just as slowly. 'Dawn dueled well'.

Egress smiles and writes out the symbols for 'Sand Spider', then takes the Lunar's hand, as satisfied as she can be. If they can counterfeit that knowledge, no test can save her.

Meanwhile, Davron feels the hand yanked abruptly off his shoulder. The feel of a cold body slamming up against his is felt, then nothing. A few moments later, another hand descends to his shoulder. Its mate presses against his solar plexus, working its way up to his head. Then he feels it striking him quite gently, curled into a fist - the way a rough parent might chastise a child for making a foolish error.

An abrupt change washes over the two Solars as their 'partners' lead them together - they can see and hear each other, albeit faintly. Sand Spider plucks a dagger from his chest and tosses it disdainfully away, speaking even as the injury heals itself. "They can take our shapes, but not our scents," he explains. "Don't trust what you feel. You can trust what you smell, or what you know. And here is the exit."

"I'll go ahead with you," says Tamuz. He clasps Sand Spider's hand, and the two shake forcefully, nodding in understanding to the other. This is how it will be. And as he speaks, the aura of darkness around the group clears. Sand Spider vanishes like a hazy mist, leaving only the three Exalts.

They find themselves in a small room, such as a study. A bespectacled man sits calmly at a desk on one side. There are chairs facing the desk, and he smiles as he looks up. The voice from nowhere speaks again. "The Eclipse challenge. All you must do is make your case to the guardian. Defend your right under Realm law to possess that which you come for."

"A preliminary agreement may allow one, and only one, to pass on. But if you are overruled, you fail the challenge."

"The sentence for breaking the law is death."

Davron rubs his chin for a moment, then shares a glance with Tamuz. The old Lunar nods, and they hold a half-whispered conference at great length and with dizzying complexity; Tamuz's live memories of First Age law, combined with Davron's encyclopedic book-learning and intellectual acumen. Occasionally, Egress overhears a snippet of conversation - "But subclause 2c says that authority passes on according to..." - which is as obscure to her as the more arcane details of Essence-artificing.

Egress again feels the relief of having chosen her allies with care. She turns to study this new adversary. For the moment, just being able to see is something of a great relief. Being able to hear. She seems calm, untroubled by this challenge, and utterly confident in the talents of those who are at her side.

One detail that Egress does catch, as Davron and Tamuz emerge from conference, is that the legal case hinges significantly upon the authority of the Deliberative in gereal and the Hierophant in particular, as recognized by the Book of Three Circles; but this is buttressed by a myriad of arcane details involving the transfer of power, chain of command, Lunar counter-signature of major military decisions made by the Deliberative, and the right of the Architect (being Davron) to override decisions involving the use of major war machines. Some of the legal minutiae seem baffling and irrelevant to a layman's understanding, such as the price of tea in Hollow (as Nexus was once known); apparently this has to do with the economic state of Creation, or possibly a decision tie-breaker.

As Egress listens, hearing talk of tea and precepts, she is reminded that while this conversation continues, Ma-Ha-Suchi is battling barbarians, that Koriko is fighting demons inner and outer, that Coranna is struggling with her partner's life, that Sand Spider is waiting in darkness, uncertain whether the next limb that extends toward him will be friend or foe. She looks about her, and sees an open door beckoning. She steps through it, hearing a voice behind her - "You can't go in there!" She ignores it.

What lies beyond is a simple, geomantically structured rooms. Egress has seen dozens of Manses in the last few years now. She recognizes the most general outlines, the Essence-shaping architecture, the arches whose form draws magic energy toward the center. And at the center of the room is a pedestal. It is empty.

She recognizes something else, too. The woman who stands here quietly, waiting for her with clasped hands and a sad smile. The woman whose red hair and flashing eyes dominated the earliest days of the Second Age as her face was projected across battlefields and cities in the Threshold. The woman who would later become the Scarlet Empress.

"Hello, Egress," she says, and bows.

Egress looks around the room for just a moment, and then sees the Empress. Somehow, she knew she would meet her here. Somehow, it feels right. She smiles and bows to the Empress, "I fear I do not know your real name," she confesses, "Yet I know your title. Have you waited here long for me?"

"I have waited over seven hundred years. Like you I passed through the door, knowing it meant my death. Knowing there were larger things than my life alone. Knowing that to wield this weapon was to break the peace. Peace was the law of the Realm. Harmony between Heaven and Earth." The Empress steps forward, shaking her head. "And so you have come."

"Because now there is no harmony."

Egress nods to the Empress. "There are larger things," she says softly. "It is not time to die yet, however. I must finish the task, first." She looks around, uncertain, "How do I find the stone? Or has it not yet reformed?" She approaches the pedestal and studies it, then looks over to the Empress. "I wish to bring harmony back to the world, but I must give the stone to my friends, so they can escape."

"To do that, you _must_ die." This voice is new. It is the Unconquered Sun, standing in the Hearthroom with a suddenness that startles Egress. The Empress nods slowly, and speaks after a moment of silence - she, too, was startled, it seems. "The Imperial Hearthstone. It requires a sacrifice." She falls silent. Helios steps forward, placing one hand gently on Egress' shoulder.

"The Manse will take from you what it took from her. It will spin the threads of fate from your soul to make a new stone. It will take your anger, your rage, your frustration, your vengeance, your honor, your valor, your inner strength. It will not diminish who you are, Egress, your soul. It will only lift those burdens from this life."

Egress looks thoughtfully at the pedestal, then turns to Helios. "Hello Father," she says gently. "I am ready then. Though I wish I had time to say goodbye to those I love, and to give back that which I was given." She looks down at her spear, "I would give this to Koriko, and my stone to Rumika. Father, can you please do this for me?"

"I will not. But it will be done. You will see." Helios steps back. The Empress smiles gently, and takes a quick step toward Egress. She wraps her arms around the other woman and hugs her tightly, squeezing lifetimes worth of sorrow and joy into the embrace. Egress can feel hot tears falling to her neck. Then she pulls away again. Slowly, her body coils upward into a white mist. Then it is gone.

The sun-god strikes Egress in the forehead with outstretched fingers. It is the last thing she ever feels as a living being. He withdraws a shining, sparkling ball of golden Essence and pockets it. From Egress' body he tugs forth a coiled white strand, and the ex-Solar finds herself as a ghost, staring down at her corpse.

Egress trusts in the words of Helios, and accepts the warmth of the Empress' embrace, holding her close, she whom so many have loathed, yet none knew her. Egress sadly reflects that now they likely shall never know the truth. Yet in the greater scheme of things, it is a small thing. A forgotten life, a courageous soul. She moves to the pedestal, and as she settles her hands upon it, she understands at last what she must do. "I am going now, Father," she says quietly.

The embodied hand grows warm, and the pedestal follows suit. The pains of a lifetime, the burdens of war and battle - the ghost feels these things draining from her. Now, her will to fight this war shall find a new home and a new incarnation. She watches the Hearthstone taking shape before her eyes. There is recognition there, but no more obligation. For her, the war can be over.

"One more thing...." Helios smiles at his ghostly companion. "Your soul has reached the end of its cycle of reincarnation. You have earned the peace of Yu-Shan." He reaches for Egress, and all becomes white...

In mid-disputation, the bespectacled clerk stops speaking. Puzzled, Davron asks a few questions, which are merely met with the same genial smile he wore when they entered. "Egress, do you have any... Egress?" he says with greater puzzlement as he finds her absent. Then he sees the door. "Shall we?" Davron asks the guardian, only to be answered with the smile - and since there is no dissent, Davron passes through the door...

And so it is that Davron finds his friend, collapsed on the floor. "Egress?" he says hesitantly... and then he understands. "She... she couldn't ask it of anyone else..." He chokes back his sobs - there is too much to do now. He collects Egress' belongings, and her body... and at last, a tear running down his cheek, the Hearthstone that she worked so hard to achieve.

"Davron."

Helios is leaning against one wall. He smiles. "Come here a second."

Davron blinks. Somehow, it is not such a surprise that the Unconquered Sun would attend on this occasion. "Yes, father?" asks the young artificer, approaching his father and god in consternation.

"I have two messages for you, both to the Dragon Kings."

"First, who you knew as Egress has been taken out of the soul that once dwelt in this body. But there was something left. Tell them they are to expend every effort in recovering it. Tell them that this is their duty, and that if they fulfill it, they have absolved themselves in my eyes."

Davron blinks, and nods, hope glinting in his eyes. "I will tell them," he says, smiling a little at the news that something of Egress remains.

"Second. That they are to fashion a soul-container, like the ones you devised, and have it blessed by the Maidens. You will work with the Sidereals to facilitate this. You will find its intended user waiting outside. Jin-nu should not be barred from having her fate mingled with that of her mistress simply because she has no human spirit, yes?"

"Rumika will gain her offspring back if the Dragon Kings are clever. And finally, Davron.. don't let those be that woman's _only_ children. Now go."

Davron blushes hotly, but can't help but laugh at this last remark from Helios. "I promise, father," he says, smiling despite his loss. It reminds him that even with Egress gone, there is so much yet for him to do. For everyone to do.

---

The gates of the Imperial Manse part once again. Davron, exhausted and grieving yet triumphant, surrounded on all sides by his Lunar and Sidereal cohorts, walks out with Egress' body cradled in his arms. The party is quickly surrounded by the impatient crowd, asking a thousand questions at once; but it is to Jin-nu that Davron first speaks, that her grief at Egress' death will be tempered swiftly by the hope of new life. And though there are so many other questions, the one most important question for all of Creation is answered in the brilliant gemstone that gleams and shimmers in the sun's light like no other Hearthstone can, nestled in Egress's hands folded over her chest.
