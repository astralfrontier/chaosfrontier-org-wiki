# Gods of Eden 2006-05-14

Talon is a young Twilight Caste Solar. He and his new Lunar bride, Blushing Moon, have been pair-bonded since last summer. In the wild lands of An-Teng, the two became familiar with the remnants of the lost culture of the ancient Dragon Kings, and Talon is one of the most fluent speakers of the High Holy Speech alive today.

It is for this reason that he and his wife have been chosen to be the liaisons to the newly awakened Dragon Kings. The strange reptiles have been returning in considerable numbers, and gods of all ranks in the Celestial Hierarchy have been selected (or have selected themselves) to participate in the joining ceremony of soul-linking.

The first such returners have already formed a society of sorts, the specific nature of which is still not clear to most humans. Its name, though, is known: The Tribe of Egress, the Tribe which returned. They select their spirit partners solely from gods of plants and growing things.

Of these, Talon has already met several _olchilike_. Today he and Blushing Moon are accompanied by a triumvirate of Dragon Kings, and escorted by several hundred Dragon-Blooded warriors. They travel to the Imperial Mountain.

Over several hours, Talon listens with growing bemusement as the leader of their reptilian cohorts, a Raptok called Lung Eater, speaks patiently in the High Holy Speech to a particularly sheer face of rock at the base of the mountain. The arguments that Lung Eater makes are compelling, but he is essentially trying to convince the rock that it should get out of his way. Absurd.

Until it does. The Celestials watch with gaping mouths as the stone swims away from its position, revealing a tunnel.

---

A few minutes of travel down the tunnel is enough to break the silence. "We're still at war out there. People are dying. What are we doing here?" Talon demands. Lung Eater, picking at his teeth with a claw, delays answering for just long enough. "Rush rush rush," he finally growls. "You're so unscaly when you whine like this, Solar. We are going to the Heaven of Plants."

"The what?" Blushing Moon asks, speaking up. "Plants don't have souls."

"So your gods say. But for every fallen tree, for every herb you eat, for every time you don't shit in your garden, the earth feels a bit of anger. The anger grows. Those feelings well up in the soil. They come here, to the Imperial Mountain. They bury themselves in the rock. They wait. We come harvest them, to aid your war effort."

"Feelings of revenge seed themselves on the Earth Dragon, coiled up here underneath the mountain. Yes. Whole Blessed Isle is the body of the Earth Dragon. Mountain is his heart." Lung Eater chortles, a distinctly unpleasant sound. "We scratch his itch, and help you fight at the same time."

"We knew nothing of that," Talon protests. "None of the gods, none of the old lore--" He is silenced by a wave of the claw by one of Lung Eater's accomplices, while Lung Eater himself answers. "You only write down what you find interesting, not all we teach. If you cared for the Dragon, or the growing things, you'd have remembered this."

The group continues to trek inward. Hours pass, until Lung Eater signals to stop. "We find stones. You gather them. We polish later," he says. He and the other two Dragon Kings go to work. They chip off fragments of the tunnel wall, one after another, without any clear indication of why they might choose a particular piece. Talon supervises the Terrestrials in collecting and storing the rock fragments, no longer protesting. He is wise enough to know the limits of his own wisdom, and ambitious enough to learn it when he sees it.

The stones are polished using occult methods which Lung Eater instructs Talon in, and which Talon in turn instructs his own disciples in. The work is performed meticulously, patiently, just as the Dragon King dictated.

One by one Lung Eater assigns roles for the stones. "Mix with Yasal Crystal and bake." "Use raw." "Crack open, shed blood onto the core."

In the end, though, Talon and his group have produced hundreds of stones shaped much like hearthstones. And Lung Eater directs them to use most of the stones as such. "No Manse. No power source. No attunement. All can use. Trade freely," he gloats.

The wily Raptok takes another two dozen stones for himself, and invites Talon and Blushing Moon to walk. In the hangar of the Imperial Legions, where four Wings' warstriders are housed, the Dragon King moves from machine to machine. In each one he implants a stone.

Finally, the work is done. "Wake up!" Lung Eater shouts, rapping on the jade carapaces with a swordstick from his garden. "Wake up, lazybones!"

The monumental war machines begin to rouse themselves - and none have pilots. Mechanical grinding noises can be heard from inside the cockpits, almost like yawning. "Old heroes of Creation fuse with plant spirits, stone spirits, stream their way into the earth," Lung Eater says to Talon while he watches. "Non-humans. Primordial children. But still heroes."

"I think you're stupid for not knowing this."

Talon bristles, having had just about enough, but Lung Eater chooses that precise moment to turn and grin a mouthful of sharp fangs at him. "You easily gulled, huh?" And Talon, lost for only a moment, bursts out laughing. Lung Eater joins him.

Davron is surprised when one of his Solar associates, and the Dragon Kings, approach him with about twenty warstriders. "Give them Volos," one of the Raptoks - Lung Eater, Davron learns later - says, abruptly. "I'll teach you the six-wing incantation, so you can stop wasting their Essence on useless things."

One of the warstriders kneels, putting one enormous gauntlet over its 'heart'. The others follow suit. "We await your orders," a mechanical voice intones.

Davron raises an eyebrow and grins. "Always full of surprises," he remarks to the Dragon King. He gestures to the supply sergeant. "Bring out the volos we have on hand," he orders to the man, and then turns to the self-driven machines. "Very well. The Southern nation-state of Clearwater Port refuses to acknowledge that the new Deliberative has legitimate authority over them; they humiliated our emissary and sent him back. Go forth to join our fleet that will reach there tomorrow, and use whatever force is necessary to prevent them from repeating their folly." Davron waves a hand, and a glowing map of the Southern sea appears in mid-air, a flickering emerald of light indicating their intended destination.

"It will be done," intones the lead warstrider. "Yeah, we'll show em!" declares another, only to get a swift nudge from a yard-wide elbow from a third. "Be respectful to our commander," another comments. The first rises; the others join in. "Your will is our command."

The mechanical giants are outfitted with Volos. Lung Eater works with each of them, singing an odd song. From each Volo, six wings sprout in glorious, radiant Essence. They unfurl themselves, and the warstriders each flex their new appendages experimentally. Then, nodding to each other, then crouch and leap. A whipping vortex of wind engulfs the entire area, and they have shot into the sky.
