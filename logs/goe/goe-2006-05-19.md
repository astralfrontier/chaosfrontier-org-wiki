The Chosen of Helios vary wildly in temperament; some are fated to wander the world, while others prefer a greater degree of permanency. But there are patterns. The Descending Suns, for example, are especially prone to staying in one place - specifically, the places where great stores of lore and magical technology are aggregated. Even with the world open to them at last, there are few such places in this latter age, and the few that exist are heavily sought after.

Arianna, one of the chief architects of the flying city Ranapura, has claimed Denandsor as her own, on behalf of the Deliberative. Under her direction, the defensive system that preserved its secrets and wealth for centuries has finally been fully harnessed and channeled; now, only the Fair Folk, the hungry dead, and the living without business in the city feel the terrible desire to be elsewhere.

Ranapura remains a highly sought-after destination for the wise, of course; its small size is no impediment to the collection of books and devices of lore, nor to the devising of small but ingenious devices. Those whose business is too minor for the Book of Three Circles itself may still find what they seek in Coranna's vast stacks, or they may be able to engage the interest of Davron in building a custom-made weapon, tool, or automaton. But for the building of larger devices, or those in great numbers - such as a new airship or an army of automata - the great and powerful seek out the factory-cathedral of Denandsor and the services of Arianna its master.

For example: The worker automata that Davron hurriedly devised to complete Ranapura have been given a new name by those who have used their services - the Faithful. But no longer is Ranapura the source of their creation; these days, the vast majority bear the imprint of Denandsor and the maker's mark of Arianna, for Denandsor's factory-cathedral is better suited to turning out these tireless working-machines in the quantities needed by a new world. Even Ranapura uses their services; although Davron's personal attendants remain the original models that he created years ago, the new Faithful that sweep the streets or tend the plantations of lifeweed are as likely as not to name Denandsor as their place of construction/birth.

And today is the day for a launching ceremony; for the construction of the flying fortress _Hikaru Maru_ - the Vehicle of Light - has finally been completed. Whereas Ranapura resembles a small flying mountain more than anything else, the Hikaru Maru is a clearly artificial construction, a gleaming toroid of orichalcum-steel like a giant wagon wheel with spokes supporting a central pillar. The outer rim bristles with armaments of all sorts, from implosion bows to anti-entropy beams, while the apex of the pillar commands a full-circle view in all directions, and the base acts as a hangar and shipyard for the mighty warstrider-hybrid Colossus, as well as a deployment point for ground troops.

Commissioned by Yurgen Kaneko, this new vessel was designed to act as the core of Creation's border defense force, going where the civilian city of Ranapura dares not, strong enough to repulse even a major Fair Folk incursion until the defense grid can be brought to bear, and fearsome enough to unnerve a rebellious mortal lord or fractious god-king by its appearance alone. Its Dragon-Blooded and mortal crew will draw in large part from the military city of Lookshy, a population well used to living on a wartime footing year in and year out in a way that the citizens, subjects, and lords of the Realm had not.

Arianna, Yurgen, and several other prominent figures are all present for the launching ceremony, arrayed around the circumference of the observation deck or, in the case of Yurgen and Arianna themselves, at the helm of the Hikaru Maru. Notable in his absence is Davron; though he would have loved to join this party, he is needed elsewhere. For Ranapura hovers above the city of Denandsor, its grapples fully deployed. Arianna is fully confident that Hikaru Maru's launch will go off without a hitch, and Davron for his part has no doubt in her abilities; but the children of the Age of Sorrows have not yet forgotten humility, and they take no chances.

The great clocks above the observation deck count down to noon, and the Celestials and Dragon-Blooded count down with them. And as the sun reaches His apex, Arianna nods, and Yurgen's roughened hands caress the controls with surprising grace... and with equal grace, the _Hikaru Maru_ wafts into the sky with the ease of a dandelion seed on the wind.

And as the cheering Exalts raise their glasses in toast, the detection officer calls out, "I've got a target flying inbound, north by northwest." Sure enough, there is a gleaming speck in the sky, from the direction of Ranapura. "Put it on display and zoom in," calls Yurgen. A crystal sphere suspended above the observation deck blossoms with light, and an image appears within: Davron, piloting a volo. He waves and grins at the crowd, having sensed the regard of _Hikaru Maru_'s potent scrying apparatus; he may have missed the launch, but he'll be damned if he's going to miss the reception afterward!

It is in the darkness just before dawn that peace is at last brought to the Blessed Isle. On some nameless isle to the west of Eagle's Launch the last blow of the war is struck. As it should be, it is Ma-Ha-Suchi who at last claims absolute victory over the forces of the usurpers. Mnemon falls last, and only after the terrifying power of the mighty Lunar hero annihilated her demon guardians.

At the conclusion of so great a hunt, the Lunars on the Blessed Isle have such a gathering as has not happened in an age. It is during this feast that Sanith first learns of the death of her mother, and though the loss saddens her, she is the child of heroes, and does not cry, instead sharing in the drinking of the blood of the hunt with her father, and cutting from her head a great lock of hair to cast into the flames in honor of her mother's name.

There are others who knew Egress present for the great feast, though it seems quite by accident in the case of Casus, who in a much different world courted a young princess of Roleyn and was meant to marry her. So much changed that world now, yet some things have not changed. Casus remains much as he was. It was a fit of wanderlust took this impulsive young man far away from the encampment of his men and the sound of celebration drew him farther still, and it was then that he saw Sanith dancing for the first time before Ma-Ha-Suchi. Wild, free, with her hair streaming and her words pouring out in a song of untamed joy, he found his heart was instantly captured.

Before so many great heroes and beastmen and barbarians, it is hard to imagine that one man could stick out, and yet as Sanith at last cast her hair into the fires her eyes met his, and when the dance ended, she was not surprised to find herself drawing him before the eyes of Ma-Ha-Suchi. The name Casus was not unknown to him, for Egress came to tell him much during the war on the Blessed Isle. Hearing that this man was meant for her mother, Sanith gave in to her impulses, and smiled when Casus impulsively compared her beauty to the stars in the heavens.

The ancient Lunar looked down upon this mortal and weighed him without so much as a word of greeting. In the eyes of that man he caught a glint of something, a memory that recalled the first meeting with the one who held his wife's lost spark. That strength of purpose, that unflagging desire to be forward and true, and the stubborn insistence that her way was the best way are all there in the eyes of Casus, and for a moment he can almost hear her words. "He was a good man, and I hope one day that he will find a worthy wife." And he remembers his own words, and a promise of Egress. The great Lunar leans forward, and seeing Casus stand steady makes up his mind. "She has kept her word," he says at last. That very night, Casus of the Marukani and Sanith, child of Ma-Ha-Suchi and Egress were wed.

When the night grows darker still, and the waxing gibbous of Luna leaves the sky, the Lunars are granted a boon that marks their victory in the most fitting of ways. The fires go out, and a silvery plume rises from their midst, and out steps the most beautiful of forms, the lady of the moon herself. Luna. Before the gathered Lunars and the greatest of their heroes, she sings the praises of the great Lunar heroes, and the name of Ma-Ha-Suchi is elevated, as he attains the level of Shahan-Ya, at last able to stand beside Leviathan as one of the greatest Lunars ever to have been.

With the peace of the Blessed Isle ensured by the power of the Solars and Lunars, its new regent, V'neef, is able to restore order. Among the many things fallen to her is the handling of the remnants of House Mnemon. Due to its great power and influence, the house is not destroyed utterly, but is to be reformed and made whole again. After many interviews with potential candidates and Deliberative approval, V'neef's selection is to be made official.

The young man Mnemon Nepel had something to him she found ideal from the very first. V'neef would deny that it was the curious tie with Egress that made this choice, but she would not pretend that it had no effect. The brief time with the Solar touched her, and the way the Solar made saving her daughter a priority will never be forgotten. Having one of the candidates just happen to have met the Solar Queen was enough to justify a full inquiry, though it was character and talent that made him the right choice.

For his part, Mnemon Nepel was only coming because he had seen many strange things and heard curious stories, and wished to hear the truth from one who would know. Yet before he even met V'neef Aliset he was certain. There was something in the way the orange blossoms fell just inside the gates of the Imperial City that reminded him of Lady Arafein, of the brief but exciting time they spent together. It was the time that led to his marriage to a wonderful woman who captured his heart completely.

"Do you remember how she drew us together?" So many times they've started long conversations with those words. But never before has Chandra said, "Somehow.. I know she was here." She tilts her head, and the wind catches her hair, streaming it behind her, and the petals of blossoms tangle themselves amongst those tresses. "The picture must have been real." Many images of Egress and Gallius are in the cities now, sold by artists of varying skill levels, from the street artists to the ingenius Exalted painters. It was from those images that the quest for truth began. The strange quest that led him to meet V'neef for the first time; this quest that led him now past those blossoms with Chandra again, to speak with V'neef about the future of House Mnemon.

V'neef is pleased to find that Mnemon Nepel brings his wife to meet with her as well. It is the first time she has met Ragara Chandra, and she finds the girl immediately likable and polite, but she can tell that inside Chandra's gentle nature is an eye that is not easily fooled. More than ever she is certain of her choice.

After a worthy feast, Mnemon Nepel is made head of House Mnemon, and in the years to come, changes its character, proving loyal and true to the will of the regent and always ready to rush to the aid of the Deliberative. Of all the houses that stood against the Solars, it is curiously House Mnemon that changes the fastest, amending its unfortunate history thanks to the skill and courage of Nepel and Chandra.

All of Creation is not quite right, however. The difficult question of the Abyssals remains, and the wise and the not quite so wise all have their own visions of what should be done with them. Initially, many move in wrath against the Abyssals. For Erisus and his bride Sun-and-Moon, the retaking of the Well of Udr is the fulfilment of an oath taken before the death of Gallius.

In this war, they are joined by a most curious ally. The Solar Rumika comes to them, and with the growing strength of her magic, aids in the destruction of the Shadowland. At the ledge of the Well of Udr itself, doom finds her. End of Fate's Twisting awaits her there, and the weight of the dark prophecy returns to her suddenly.

But even the dark prophecies of the Underworld rarely end as one expects. The Abyssal does not wish to fight her daughter. She came to speak with Erisus, the one who cared for Ra, who once held the same taint that lies upon her spirit. With the attention of the greatest Solar Healer and the far deeper wisdom of Erisus, the search for purity begins.

The finding is a long process, and End of Fate's Twisting must visit ancient sites of power and truth all over Creation and even past its borders, into small islands of structure in the madness of the Wyld. Only when she has been burned, drowned, encased in rock, blasted into wind, and grown from her ashes is she purified, claiming the name of Joy-at-Dawn and rejoining her daughter.

There are few other cases of Abyssals seeking to 'heal' themselves, but those that do at last have a means given to them, however herculean it is. Far more wish to remain themselves, and find they must hide deep in the Underworld to avoid the wrath of zealous Solars.

For the first years after the victory over the Realm, Yurgen Kaneko, Heirophant of the Solar Deliberative, is able to wear away at the Shadowlands, shrinking them swiftly. His is a mind that demands action, and he is nothing if not effective. However, more and more, as he strides about the unforgiving tundra that is his home, he feels that somehow this seat is meant for another. It surprises everyone when Yurgen makes clear his desire to leave this duty, and though his reasons are not clear, his faith in them is strong.

It is with great difficulty that the Deliberative seeks its next leader. Only after much careful consideration is the Zenith Koriko chosen. Her heroic deeds and unfaltering leadership during the war with the Realm gained a great deal of support from the Lunars, and her more flexible views on what is best for Creation were greatly approved of by the Solars and Sidereals. In the end, her selection would be seen as a triumph.

At first, Koriko's guidance and policies are much like Yurgen's, but slowly she finds her opinions changing. There are times when she finds thoughts coming unbidden to her, and her mind is slowly broadened. She often finds it happening when she visits the ruins of Harborhead's palace, or when she walks the streets of Greyfalls, sharing stories with Alcis and basking in the peace that has made the city a byword for healing and clarity throughout Creation.

This curious broadening of thought tells her that the Solars must be whole again. It tells her that all Celestials must cooperate. It leads her to extend a hand of peace to the Abyssals, and it prevents the closing of a shadowland remnant in the north, making certain it is preserved as a bridge between the worlds. An understanding will exist between the Underworld and Creation. The threat of Yozis using the Underworld as a staging area for an assault on Creation proves decisive in the debate.

Over the years, the relationship with Abyssals grows better, and though there is certainly much distance yet between the two sides, it is not the gulf of hatred it once was. There is an appreciation of the cycle of life and death that builds over the years. In the passing years, the Fair Folk learn to dread the Abyssals as much if not more than the Solars. There is something in the Abyssals that gives them a terrible power against the denizens of the Wyld, and with years of relative peace and unity to build their formidible strength, they come at last into their own, standing proudly beside their Solar kindred against the madness of the Wyld and battering it back relentlessly.

The unity of all Celestials ensures that the Deliberative has authority both in Creation and the Underworld, and brings a wider scope of thought to the Chosen and mortals both as many of the wonders of death are revealed by the great Abyssal priests.

In the ancient city of Rathess, the greatest minds of the Dragon Kings are turned to a singular body. It is the corpse of Egress. She is a figure that the Dragon Kings had only begun to sort in their hearts at the time of her death. They did not get to know the woman who restored their hope and gave them this path to redemption before she perished, but at last her image has been returned to them, even if the house of the body has crumbled.

They perceive the presence of another living inside it only after much study. Knowing far more about the secret nature of souls than almost all in Creation, the Dragon Kings are able to carefully plan the procedure that will bring life back to this lost child.

For almost five full years they labor carefully, rebuilding the soul of Beautiful Sun Blossom mote by mote, essence entwined in ways so complex that the Solar healers who come to oversee the task are swiftly lost. Of all of these, it is unsuprirising that Rumika is the most constant presence, leaving only to share what she learns with Sun-and-Moon and Erisus in their work to save End of Fate's Twisting, and to join Davron when the craftsman has time away from his great works. It is during one of these meetings that Davron obeys the will of Helios, though Rumika does not tell him of his success until later.

When at last Beautiful Sun Blossom is restored, she is the very mirror image of Egress, though her voice is as it was before. The presence of a tail is something the young woman is curious about, but in the joy of living once more, it is more wondrous than troubling. That night of tears is a night of great celebration for the Dragon Kings. The blessing of the Sun turns their great Pyramid to purest gold, and the radiance of the sun dazzles the city with its light for days, and all the efforts of the Dragon Kings find success.

Only a month after Beautiful Sun Blossom returns Rumika gives birth to a daughter she names South Wind Blessing. Word is sent to Davron only when his wife is nearly due, drawing him from his projects with haste.

The glory of the Dragon Kings only increases, and with the blessing of Helios their's once again, they throw themselves at every task with zeal. The forging of the Soul gem is the next great deed they undertake at the orders of their Lord. For four years their minds are turned to this work, and when at last they succeed, a great, warm wind moves through the city, and in it they hear soft whispers, and though they cannot make out the words in the wind, they feel a deep and profound peace come to them. Thanks to their efforts, the faithful Jin-nu at last has a soul.

A hundred years have passed.

The great trade city of Nexus is what it is. The Deliberative has recognized that a degree of lawlessness is expected - if not encouraged - in some corners of Creation, to prevent it from spreading to all. The city remains as it was, adding only the past glory of Hollow as the reconstruction of the First Age architecture is conducted under the auspices of the Deliberative. Material losses are a regular occurrence.

Other cities, such as Chiaroscuro, once housed the wonders of a bygone era. The restoration of these wonders of the ancient world is a project for budding young Twilights, while keeping the architects safe is the duty of newly-Exalted Dawns.

Flying craft are seen in the skies more and more often. They display the insignias of the Celestial Exalts, and occasionally the abstract iconography of the Dragon-Blooded. The Great Houses remain true to themselves, even if the Realm they once knew has vanished. Like all of the Exalted, they too are heroes, not easily overcome.

The Fair Folk come, in wave after wave. Their invasions are cast back into the Wyld by the power of the Defense Grid, the flying war-cities, and more exotic weapons.

When they are not invading, the Fair Folk come to Creation to trade, to hold pageants and faires and spectacles. The common folk fear them, but the presence of the Exalted at such occasions provides some reassurance. The fey living dreams of the Wyld are capricious, attacking one year, holding comedic galas the next. Interesting times are the price one pays to live on the Bordermarches.

On one such occasion, a commoner messenger from the Harrowing Foresters Troupe brings a gossamer-forged gift from its master, who it does not name. It says simply that this gift is for "the new god", before departing.

News from Taru-Han surprises everyone three days later. It seems that there is a new god which shall be born.

Ma-Ha-Suchi is in attendance. Two children ride on his shoulder - his great-great-grandchildren. Their wolf-like ears peeking out of blue-hued hair, and their feral eyes, mark them as other than human. Their parents come with the Lunar, bringing the first fruits of their tribes' harvest as a gift.

Rain of Fire is there, cloaked in human shape. It rules the southern volcanos, dispensing lava and magma to the orichalcum crafters.

Chi-Yosh is there, wearing the magnificent garments of semisolid water he created. Marina is there, gently rocking a baby child in the crook of one arm. It is not hers - she is merely the tutor, for none can teach growing kings or queens like Marina.

Yana and Havesh are there - perhaps. They have taken it upon themselves to challenge each other for the title of "Most Subtle of the Sun-Gods". None can be sure who is winning, but all agree that the competition has not been seen in decades.

Davron and Rumika are there as well, with Joy-at-Dawn hovering protectively on her daughter's other side. Since returning to the light of day, Rumika's mother has been constantly in touch with her, to the point that Davron, in a wry mood, is sometimes moved to wonder whether or not he liked it better when she was still End of Fate's Twisting. Still, after a half-score of decades with Rumika, Davron still believes she is worth any price - and Joy-at-Dawn is a good and true friend, even if she is his mother-in-law.

Finally, Jin-Nu is present. She is at death's door - a century of mortal life is catching up with her, for with a soul she has also inherited the blessing, or the curse, that all humankind possesses. She talks of scattered dreams and refuses offers of youth-restoring benisons. But she is here.

The Exalted, their companions, friends, and children are gathered at the Great Tree in Yu-Shan. Saturn, the Maiden of Endings, approaches the tree in her robes of office, then nods politely at those assembled. The Exalts bow deeply and humbly in return, while those mortals mature enough to do so abase themselves.

"We begin, and we end," Saturn says simply, and withdraws an apple from her robe. She calmly takes a bite out of it, and Davron is near enough to Jin-Nu to hear her rattling final breath. She sat on a bench near the tree, eyes half-shut; to anyone else, she might only be sleeping. Saturn calmly finishes the apple.

Reaching up, she plucks another from the tree branches, and presents it. "We sow what we reap," she says, and bends down. Pushing aside the dirt, she digs a small hole and carefully buries the apple core. She covers it up, then stands again.

The Maiden of Endings smoothly pockets the newly-plucked apple and smiles. "A new goddess is born in Yu-Shan," she says.

The gathered Celestials and friends turn, hearing the shuffling of feet on the stone walkway. The first thing they see is a leonine tail swishing behind the white robes of Heaven. The second thing they see is a red thread tied to one pale finger, which trails off into the distance.

"Push! Push!" The beleagured physician chants his mantra to the screaming woman on the table. Beside the physician, a hapless father watches. The tension of the delivery room is broken at last by a newborn baby's cries. "It's a girl!" exults the physician, herself female and proud to deliver more strong women. The mother and father gasp in mutual delight, looking down at their newborn child. Only the physician, and just for a moment, catches what looks like a red fiber tied to the child's fingers. "The red thread of fate?" she asks herself quietly, while the parents speak to each other excitedly. "We'll call her Ginny," the mother announces.

---

Two hundred and fifty years have passed since the fall of the Blessed Realm.

The Dragon-Blooded woman who toils in her garden rises, wiping the sweat from her brow. It has been a long, fruitful life time. Her Wood Aspect is strong, but Kal Ginny of Greyfalls has always had more than that. In her time tending to all growing things, she has had the favor of Heaven. And she has always been visited by a beautiful goddess who speaks to her of old stories, and seems to know all the things she dreams. Now, she rises in anticipation of her good friend's arrival in her garden, a thing she can sense instinctively.

---

A thousand years have passed.

Five children dash across a grassy field, their Caste Marks glowing brightly on their foreheads. Though Half-Caste, they are still powerful enough that their parents trust them.

For the most part. Davron's Silver Shrikes fly on metallic wings overhead, ready to unfold into deadly automata protectors should something befall his descendants. Still, they fly high, so as not to disturb their joy. They are going to see two important people today.

The field is no match for childish exuberance and energy, and soon the five - three boys, two girls - arrive, panting slightly, at a hilltop at the center of the plain. Here grows a simple tree whose leaves catch the sunlight even when clouds fill the sky, and they gather around the tree, bowing respectfully to it.

"Hello, Mr. Ramar!" says the eldest as she pays homage. The others greet the tree similarly, and a cool breeze rustles the leaves in a gentle, welcoming response.

Through the geas, Ramar has become immobile. The first and only of his kind among trees, he had no chance to seed, to spread. But something happened. Now, his seeds have been carried to every corner of the globe. His innumerable offspring grow wherever there is soil, no matter the conditions, displaying an unbelievable hardiness that defies botanists. As a tree, he has traveled further and seen more than he ever did as a man.

"And hello, Mrs. Egress!" says the eldest again, bowing to the gently-smiling goddess who stands by the side of the tree and watches them. "We can see you today, we learned how!" she announces proudly.

Egress' laughter comes warmly, and to reward such skill in the children, she shakes her hair behind her, and the scent of cherry blossoms fills the air, followed by a streaming of glowing petals of essence that weave like ribbons into their hair. "You are clever children." To her, the way time shall bring them to fruition is clear, and the beauty that others can only imagine, she knows. "And you have been very good, haven't you? I think perhaps they deserve a tale and a song, Ramar. Ones they haven't heard yet."

And in a swirl of light Davron arrives, still gesticulating as he mends the fabric of Creation behind him. Looking around ruefully at his offspring, he chuckles. "Well, look at that. I cheat, and you _still_ beat me here!" Turning to the tree, he says, "Hello, you two. I trust the young ones haven't been bothering you?" He grins - for Ramar, with the patience of the forest, and Egress, with the peace of eternity, would not soon be troubled by a few human children, even impetuous and irksome Solar Half-Castes.

The Goddess of Blossoming smiles at Davron. "They had only just arrived. They do move very swiftly!" She sighs quietly and again her laughter rings out, and this time little blue flowers open about her. "We were just trying to find the right song and tale to tell them. They have been very good, haven't they, Davron? They have such bright faces, I imagine they haven't any mischief in them at all." She sneaks in a quick wink to the eldest boy and smirks knowingly.

Davron simply laughs without passing comment. "Well, I'm sure we'd all love to hear a story," he replies, sitting down carefully on the grass. As much as the story, he is here to spend time with his family and friends.

Egress settles herself by the tree, leaning back into it as if the bole were embracing her. She smiles over at Davron and after some concentration, manifests so that the youngest of the girls can settle in her lap. "I think that will always feel at least a little strange," she murmurs. In the rustling of the leaves, the suggestion of the tale is clear, and Egress nods thoughtfully. "I think that story will do well. A tale of romance, of battle, but most of all, of friendship. It is strange, though, that we've never told the children the full story of how we all came to meet before." She runs her fingers through the hair of the young girl in her lap and laughs when Ramar's answer comes gently to her, "Who would ever believe such a crazy tale?"

The tale is the meeting of the Solars so long ago. Ramar, Marina, Chi-Yosh, and Davron, and later Gallius who became Egress. It is told entirely by Ramar, in the strange language of moving branches and soft winds, the story reflected in his leaves with the finest of details. Somewhere during the tale Rumika appears and settles herself at Davron's side, finding her lap immediately occupied by the littlest of the boys. Her place is not forgotten in the tale. The young one in Egress' arms blurts out, "If momma is your momma, does that mean I have a goddess for a big sister?" The boughs of Ramar shake in mirth at this discovery, and the Goddess of Blossoming nods thoughtfully, "Yes, but more importantly, it means I have all five of you as my brothers and sisters. I'm very fortunate."

Davron nods happily to Egress. In his long lifetime, he's still managed to find new things to do, and learn, and build... and yet, for all of that, he realizes that he's at his happiest right here, with Rumika and Ramar and Egress, with his children, with the sun warming him and the breeze blowing through the grass. Not for the first time, he remembers how his predecessor to the Spark had forgotten all that was peaceful in life, and worries that he too may forget, someday. _May that day be a long time coming_, Davron resolves silently, leaning against Rumika.

Egress has not forgotten those fears completely, though she has long since been removed from that danger herself. She shows no fear at all, now. Her vision is filled only with beautiful things, and what little sadness she encounters she can see in the greater scheme of Creation, and it gives her wisdom.

Even with magic, the telling of a long story takes time, but eventually the story unravels the long cords of history and fate, leading to this day. Children being as they are, they have so many questions that most would be overwhelmed, but not Egress and Ramar. With the view of endless years they are far too pleased to stop the children. Ramar must assure the children that yes, he was scared when he hung on a thread over Oblivion, and the Goddess of Blossoming assures them that death didn't hurt nearly so much as other injuries she had faced. Many questions are answered with only a warm smile, or with 'that is another story'.

When at last things grow more quiet, the Goddess sings. All about her things grow silent, and the very earth seems to be straining to listen to her. The song is unlike any the children have heard, for it has no need of words, nor does it inspire emotion like most music does. Only in the fullness of time does Egress allow the tones to burst into its full beauty, bringing a sudden, intense rush of love and comfort into the hearts of all who will listen. Somewhere in all this, night has come, but it holds no fear. Under the leaves of Ramar, there is always light, and the strength of the Solars has long since made this land safe.

At last the Goddess grows silent and with a deep sigh she leans back against Ramar. She says gently, "If I could do it all over again, I would, just so that we could be here, right now." She lids her eyes, but her smile remains as she feels the love and peace around her. In the lap of the Goddess, her baby sister dozes off, laying her head upon Egress' breast and slipping into beautiful dreams. The Goddess whispers, "Everything is exactly as it was meant to be, and I've never been happier."

To that, Davron can only nod in acknowledgment, and whisper, "Amen."
