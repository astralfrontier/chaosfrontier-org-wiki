# highoctane-10-oct-2002

It's the day after the show. Johnny Z and his entourage (consisting of Janice Bourne, bodyguard, and Spider Malone, getaway driver) are cooling off in Johnny's studio/office, the second floor of a two-story office building in northern Los Angeles. The loft is littered with bits of electronic junk, pieces of sheet music, reel-to-reel tapes, and music magazines. The only clear spots are a large leather couch, and a relatively paper-free corner where Janice has her desk.

Spider is lounging on one corner of the couch, perched like a gargoyle and idly tinkering with a discarded device's broken connectors.

JohnnyZ lays sprawled out on most of the rest of the couch, snoring, crowding Spider, and drooling a little, looking a little less the rock star. But that's the life of a rock star, isn't it? Rock hard, then crash.

The team is relaxing after the previous evening's shennanigans, where Janice and Spider extracted Johnny from Club Penn when it turned rowdy, touched off by an edgy biker throwing bottles of stale beer at Johnny, and instead hitting bystanders in the crowd.

Janice sits behind her desk, reading reviews of Johny Z's show in several papers. "You know, we didn't need the bikers, but they didn't really hurt, either. You're getting edgier, Johnny."

The dust drifts lazily through the beams of light slanting in through the wide picture windows. A buzzer sounds, indicating someone at the front door.

JohnnyZ's sunglasses hide his relative state of unconciousness. He does manage an 'Mm-hmm.' having replied in his sleep before.

Janice stands up, moving quickly to the door. She looks through the key hole, carefully.

Janice stands at the bottom of the stairwell, peeking through the peephole on the front door. There's a woman standing in front of the door, propping herself against the doorframe with one hand. She's partially stooped over, so that her straight brown hair covers part of her her face. As you stand there, she reaches for the buzzer again, somewhat shakily.

JohnnyZ blinks, waking up. "Gah. Doorbell? Who's visiting at this ungodly hour of the afternoon?"

Janice sighs, and opens the door graciously, allowing the woman to enter the hallway.

The woman starts when the door opens, as if she wasn't quite expecting anyone to be home. She just about falls through the doorframe. Now that the door is open it's easier to see what shape she's in - she's well-dressed in jeans and a short jacket, but they're covered in dust; her hair appears somewhat windblown and equally dusty.

Janice ushers the woman in, after assessing her. Stepping outside, she checks the street for bad news.

JohnnyZ says, "Hey, love! Who is it down there?" He idly snatches an apple from the table, taking a good bite out of it as he waits for an answer.

The woman recovers. "Thank you. I'm Morella, I'm looking for Johnny."

Janice steps through the doorway and looks in both directions. While not deserted, the street outside is quiet for Los Angeles on a Saturday morning; nobody else is on the sidewal.

Janice growls under her breath, closing the door again. "Johnny? He's kinda busy. But I'm sure we can make time for you." Moving to the stair case, she invites Morella to come upstairs.

JohnnyZ says, "Morie? Is that you love?" He smiles wide, rising in a state of handsome rumpledness. "God, come over here girl and let me give you a hug!" He spreads his arms wide, closing. "I haven't seen you since the Pizza Incident."

Janice stands by the door, watching the couple intently.

Morella blanches, barely detectably, at the mention of the Pizza Incident. "Johnny! It's been a long time! I hear you're a big rockstar now!"

JohnnyZ grins at the poor girl, bringing her out to arm's length to get a look at her. "Getting there love. Being playing up and down the east coast, becoming the next Doro-whateverhisnameis. So, what brings you to my little corner of rockdom?"

Janice purses her lips. "Yes, Miss Morella, what brings you to our little haven?"

"Oh, don't get me wrong, miss... ummm... " She shrugs. "I'm not a script-flinger or anything. I knew Johnny in college... and... well... I need some help with something wierd, and I figured that if it's wierd, Johnny's the right guy for it." She half-smiles. "I'm sorry, but ... I could use some water."

JohnnyZ finally notices her paleness. "Dear girl, you do look a fright. Here, sit down. Janice, where do we keep the bottled stuff?"

Janice cocks an eyebrow at Spider, and mouthes _water?_ at him.

Spider stirs on the sofa, his eyebrows furrowed as he looks up. "Better sit down," he offers gruffly, vacating the sofa. He nods irritably at Janice, then begins foraging for water in one corner.

JohnnyZ says, "So what's wierd, Morie? I mean, what's got you afright?"

Spider finds a bottle of Johnny's 'recovery water' in the fridge on a shelf marked 'In Case Of Hangover'. It's just an ordinary bottle of Evian. The woman calling herself Morella starts to look a bit more human as she drinks.

Morella looks thoughtful for a moment. "Well... you know that I was studying geology in school... when I got out I started doing consulting for prospectors - mineral surveys, and things like that. I got a contract from the State to do a mineralogical study near Blood Mesa, out in the desert."

JohnnyZ says, "That would explain the dust. So you were doing well then? I always said you'd be a rock star too."

Janice says, "Blood Mesa? There's nothing there, Johnny."

Spider adds darkly, "Except a lot of superstition."

JohnnyZ shrugs. "Whaddya mean, guys?" He looks confused, but let's face it. He has a hard enough time remember which town he's playing in.

Spider points at Morella, replying. "Maybe we'd better let the lady finish." And he turns, nodding. "So..?"

Morella nods when Janice speaks. "Nobody thought there was anything there, except for one old silver mine that's been played out for years, but the Department of the Interior has been looking at sattelite photos of the area and they think there may be another deposit in a different part of Blood Mesa. The lowlands around the mesa are warmer at night than the surrounding area for almost a mile around, and that means there might be something underground - denser soil, or metals, or water."

Janice nods. "So where does Johnny come in? The department stopped funding you?"

Morella pauses, and finishes the water bottle. "So I wrangled to get the contract to do the geological survey out of the state, and I've been up there for a few days taking soil samples and photographs."

JohnnyZ says, "Easy, Jan. But she's got half a point. What brings you here?"

Morella frowns. "Last night, just after dusk, I was on lowlands, south of the mesa, taking some measurements - temperature, humidity, a few other things. Then I saw something moving on top of the mesa."

Morella says. "I thought it was nothing, but it got brighter... five or six balls of light, floating down the cliff. I was a half a mile away, but they looked like they were coming right towards me!"

Morella shuts her eyes, as if she can still see the mysterious fireballs. "It wouldn't have been so bad, except then the winds started to pick up. I was a few hundred feet from my jeep, so I turned and ran."

Janice raises an eyebrow. "And came straight here?"

JohnnyZ whoas. "Freaky..." he breathes, eyebrows raised.

Morella opens here eyes. "I wasn't really thinking straight. The wind was blowing really hard, and I got knocked off my feet. The lights... caught up with me, I guess, after a minute. I think I fell unconscious, but I can't tell for how long, because my watch stopped working." She turns to Janice. "No, not straight here. I slept overnight in a motel on I-15. I live up in Santa Barbara... Johnny's closer, and..."

Janice raises the other eyebrow, conceding the detour. "And now you're hoping Johnny will ..." She pauses, and turns to Johnny. "Don't forget you've got gigs lined up all week."

Morella is quiet for a moment. "This is embarassing, but... I'm scared. I don't believe in ghosts or any of that stuff, but I don't want to go back there alone."

"So... " she finishes, "I came to ask Johnny to go back with me, because wierd things don't scare him."

JohnnyZ says, "C'mon, Jan, can't we blow the gigs, take a break? I mean, Morie's scared here, and the desert night...a deep desert beat might be great inspiration!"

Janice looks at Johnny Z, and shrugs. "It's your rep, pretty boy. But blow off too many gigs, and you'll never make it big."

Spider lets out a grating chuckle. "Sure, it's supposed to be a sacred place to the Mohave. Curses, ghosts, weird vision quests, strange apparitions... lotta ball-lightning, more likely, but hey."

JohnnyZ says, "C'mon, Janice. After last night's fiasco, I bet they want to be let out, for insurance's sake. And if this place lives up to it's billing, there could be a record in this."

Sighing, Janice shakes her head. "Right; we're off to see the desert." Crossing to the desk, she busies herself with her rolodex. "Let's see, I'll have to call Claude, and Paul ... How many days should I cancel you for Johnny?"

JohnnyZ looks to Moire. "How about three? Say I was injured in the fight with the boys last night."

Morella speaks up. "I don't want to impose, but could I get a shower? I've been camping out and I feel kinda grungy."

Spider says, "We're all about grunge, here. But let me show you the facilities while Janice phones and Johnny detoxes."

JohnnyZ smiles. "Sure Moire. If you'd like some company..." He grins at her reaction. "Can you blame me for trying?"

Janice starts calling the producers.

Morella chuckles nervously, and wanders off towards the bathroom. After a few minutes, there's the sound of running water.

Having finished the phonecalls, Janice turns to Johnny. "So, this Miss Morella; you know her well? She hallucinate often? Or is she clean?"

JohnnyZ says, "Look, Jan. The only rock she's ever done is granite. She's solid. Too solid for me, I guess. We dated for three years in college, and I never knew her to be anything but upright."

Spider digs some maps of the Blood Mesa area out of a box in the closet, left over from a camping trip the previous year. They show the area in some detail - a large plateau at southern tip of the Sierra Nevada mountains, south from Death Valley and just east of CA-135. The plateau is surrounded by a combination of flat, dusty desert and gentle, dry hills for a distance of several miles.

JohnnyZ says, "And I'd really appreciate if you give her a break."

Janice nods. "Very well; shall we take the van? We're gonna want some supplies; tents, camp stoves, bazookas ... you know, the usual." _Upright? You mean in three years you never got her horizontal? Sure, and the pope is jewish._

JohnnyZ nods, and does a circut himself. Mini tape record, a multi-keyboard, and the Colt. _Ah, Morie. It was nothing, you know..._

Janice takes a moment to call John Bull, the prison guard watching over Sean O'Malley, an IRA officer whose time in prison is directly attributable to Janice's last missions with the FBI and CIA. Bull reports that nothing has changed with O'Malley - he's still surley, violent, and solidly behind bars.

Johnny carries a small pile of towels into the washroom as the water stops running. Janice and Spider here a short shriek, and Johnny quickly ducks back out of the bathroom, closing the door behind him. "I didn't see anything! I promise!"

You can all faintly here Morella muttering 'You haven't changed at all!' through the closed door. She doesn't sound _entirely_disappointed.

It takes little time to load the essentials into Johnny's van - food, flashlights, batteries, and maps. Some more exotic items include a variety of handguns, and one of Johnny's synthesizers ("Hey! You never know when it will come in handy!")

With a quick stop at the Army-Navy store on the next block for some camping gear, spare ammo, and a lot of rope, the team sets out for Blood Mesa. Morella asks someone to ride with her in her jeep; at Janice's insistence, Johnny and Spider ride in the van, and Janice rides shotgun for Morella.

Janice watches the road and the driver with equal intensity.

Traffic is light for a Saturday just after noon. As Interstate 15 rolls out of town, the relative civilization of the Los Angeles city proper gives way to suburbs, acres and acres of hills covered with sparse grass, broken up by clusters of houses and businesses. After an hour, even these give way to vast, empty stretches of rocky plains - the southern reaches of California's Mojave Desert.

Spider whistles tunelessly, hands resting easily on the van wheel.

JohnnyZ rolls his eyes, pulling out the keyboard and picking at it, just as tunelessly. After a few moments, something folksy, almost country emits. "I'm just a passanger on a trip, without your company..." o/~

Spider eyes Johnny from the driver's seat. "You know," he says conversationally, "a large amount of static electricity can burn out sensitive devices.. like your synth. Get a lot of static buildup in the desert. You can walk around with it on your skin for hours after."

After an hour and half on the road, everyone gets off the highway in Baker, California to stop for gas and stretch their legs. State highway 135 stretches north from I-15 here towards the town of Death Valley and the famous national monument of the same name.

JohnnyZ says, "Nice try, Spider. Millivolts don't connect through plastic keys."

JohnnyZ sighs, slipping up to the Jeep. "So, Jan, do you trust her yet, or did you just pick up all the dirt on me?"

Janice turns to look at Johnny. "Is there a lot of dirt to dig up?"

JohnnyZ looks innocent. "No! Of course there isn't. Right. I'm just going to grab a water. Anything for you?"

Spider calls out cheerfully through the open passenger-door of the van. "Six-pack for me, buddy!"

JohnnyZ says, "Deal! As long as I get to drive!"

Janice nods. "Water would be nice, Johnny."

JohnnyZ heads into the store, collecting the liquids, and heading back out.
