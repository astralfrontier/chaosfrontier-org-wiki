# highoctane-7-aug-2002

_Club Penn - although whether it's Pennsylvania or Penecillin is an open question, because this dive combines all the worst aspects of the famous Penn Station railway terminal, and a pile of moldy bread. The decor used to be art deco retro but was not built to last. Many artists in the area have played this venue both on their way up and on the way down the charts._

The famous Johnny Z has arranged a return to 'The Penn', having played here while he was on the way up. He's midway through developing material for a new album and is looking to generate some buzz.

The crowd is a fantastic array - punk rockers in leather; glam rockers with big hair in a variety of un-natural colors; some otherwise-average looking people in denims and t-shirts. A small area is available in front of the stage for the parts you can dance to; tables along the walls are filled, some with people here for the show, some with people here for a drink.

Janice sits at a table on the side of the stage, a glass of coke above her, as she surveys the crowd. _Come on, Johnny. Get them dancing if you want to please the owner ..._

Spider is by the door, chatting up a few patrons and ready (if necesary) to ensure a clear path to the door. Ugly incidents have happened before..

JohnnyZ's alive on stage, his blonde (natural, so he claims) hair big as his fingers dance over keyboards, laying down intricate but catching riffs, bridging them together in a long keyboard instrumental that is his trademark, his fingers flying in rapid rhapsody as he tries to feed the crowd.

JohnnyZ's voice finally comes back in, floating hauntingly above the electronic sounds. "Sliding down the highway, floating on the four, the tires on the pavement, the foot on the floor, the music just keeps coming, the pavement flying by, cause we powered by sound and it's just you and I..."

Janice sighs, looking round the room. _Bring 'em down, Johnny, bring 'em down._ She slides to her feet, moving to the wings so she can escort Johnny out the door before the fans find him.

The crowd's definitely loving Johnny Z, and he's loving the crowd. This is the best act that has passed through these moldy halls in some time and the smallish dance floor is packed with people trying to fit everything from disco to slam-dancing with Johnny's sound.

JohnnyZ flashes a brilliant smile to the crowd as it dances. He's got to push them, make them glad they came tonight, and wanting him. "Faster and faster and faster and faster we GOOOOOOOO...and we're never ever slowing dow-ow-ow-owwwn...becasuse we're running high octane!"

Spider Malone, professional wheelman, is covering the front half of the club; Janice Bourne, bodyguard and former spook, is covering the back. There's a small backstage area with a 'dressing room' (more like a repainted broom closet) and a door that leads out into the back alley; the club's native goons are covering the doors. The front is similarly being watched by a heavyset man who so far hasn't moved very much but gives the impression it would register on the Richter scale if he did.

Janice shakes her head, looking disgusted. _**Down**, Johnny. We don't need another stinking mob scene._ She turns to look at the heavyset man.

Spider frowns a little but keeps watch, knowing the signals to expect in case something breaks out. He's all for action, but he's not the leader of this little posse.

JohnnyZ blasts a few more chords, his head bouncing with the effort, sweat dripping off him as he rolls it up for the night to the adulation of the crowd. "YEAH! Awesome! Thank you, Penn Station! And good night!:"

The crowd is, of course, calling for an encore; Z's two backup guitarists are hurridely knocking back a drink or three, because they've seen this before.

Spider makes a few furtive head-twists in Janice's direction, hoping she catches on..

Janice notices Spider's head. She turns to look at him, mouthing "Trouble?"

JohnnyZ grins, considering, waiting, taunting them with the possibility...

Spider lets his gaze drift towards the table where a matched set of guys in leather sit. He wobbles his hand a bit -- "iffy".

Janice turns to looks at the matched leather set. She nod, once, back at Spider, and then looks them over slowly and carefully, ignoring Johnny behind her.

JohnnyZ drops back down onto the keyboard, a drum machine kicking in as he drops into his hit electronic version of the bumble boogie, known as Bee Beat.

The crowd loves it. The four guys in leather obviously don't, unless bellowing in anger and throwing bottles is a traditional way of expressing affection in their tribe.

Janice moves closer to the front of the stage, keeping one eye on Spider, one on the leather clad, and a spare one on Johnny.

Spider stares straight at Janice and jerks his thumb behind him, toward the front door, then points forward, towards the rear exit -- "make a choice, front or back", is his intention.

As one of the man picks up a half empty bottle of tequila, Janice shakes her head once at Spider, indicating the back exit.

Both Janice and Spider seem to realize that Johnny's in no immediate danger from the bottle, but that this is Trouble, and it's time to wrap up the show.

The half-empty bottle would have hit Johnny if it had been something more aerodynamic, like a baseball, but it's just not designed as a throwing weapon, and so it crashes against the back of a patron out on the dance floor, making an awful mess... and one very upset dancer.

Janice growls, and straightens up. Her thumb heads straight for the back entrance, as she herlsef tries to reach the stage.

JohnnyZ is lost in the highly techical playing, his fingers a blur as he plays, music pouring from the speakers in a wave as the crowd bounces as one. He blinks as someone comes up on stage, Janice... uh-oh. Show's over. He finishes with a even faster flourish, knocking the tempo up a notch. "Yeah! G'night!" He takes a quick glance at Janice, wondering which way to head, his hands on his precious keyboard...

Janice pulls her head back, and holds out her arm, back to the stage, so that Johnny has a wall of sorts to hide him form the crowd.

Janice is moving towards the stage, past a Club Penn bouncer who's wading out into the crowd like a Russian icebreaker into the Bering Sea. Most of the dancers still seem to be in a state of confusion about the sudden end to the music, except for the guy who got doused; he's turned towards the front of the club and has seen the guy who threw the bottle.

The backup guitarists rapidly unplug from the amps and are heading for the back door. "So long, Johnny, good set, I just remembered I left a cake burning in the oven!"

Spider shrugs, and with a slight smirk heads out for the front door. Janice seems to have things in the back covered, so it's time to make tracks.

Janice moves forward, helping Johnny unplug his synth somewhat abruptly. _It's one plug, dammit, how long can it take?_

JohnnyZ yanks and runs, getting sheparded by Janice. "G'night, Penn Station!" he calls, blowing kisses over her shoulder as the crowd stands in confusion, beginning to panic. "Love ya! Mwha! Mwha!"

Some of the club patrons, who can see what's coming, have started to leave the club in a hurry. The big front double-doors, propped open to supplement the inadequate air conditioning, are exhaling stream of heat, cigarette smoke, beer odors, and a few dozen barflies... near the head of the pack is Spider Malone, who breaks off from the crowd and heads for the car... a mid-70's Shelby Cobra, a lovingly-polished 500 horsepower muscle car.

The bouncer moving from the back of the club is just a bit too slow to catch the one dancer, who it's plain now is upset about what the tequila has done to his hair (which was short and spiky, but is now short, spiky, and smells like cheap booze), and is more than willing to take it out on a biker thug and his three friends. The front bouncers, however, have caught up to the bottle thrower, and are suggesting that he leave... with a bum-rush.

Spider jerks the thirsty engine into gear and careens recklessly around the parking lot, coming as close as he can to reaching the back entrance. The horn blares.

Janice pushes the synth into Johnny's hands. "Hustle, man. Hustle. The thugs are out."

Spider hops into the driver's seat and starts the giant engine. It comes to life with a throaty roar in the way that only a big street rod can, getting the attention of everyone in a half-block radius.

As it happens, four motorcycles - a big chopper, a heavy Harley touring bike, and two dusty smaller machines that look like they're made for off-road, are blocking the alley between the stage entrance and the front parking lot.

JohnnyZ charges. "Dammit, who's the star here?" he asks, taking the heavy synth. "Sorry folks, things are looking ugly. Buy the album!" His mouth moves a little faster than his feet, even running pandering to his fans.

"Oh, for bloody ... !" Janice checks behind her, to make sure she hasn't lost her client, and then she turns to face the machines. "Johny; stay behind me. We'll cover this. If you can reach the car, go!"

Johnny is running down the alley, cradling his long synth under one arm, panting slightly, tired from the concert and now tired from the run.

Spider reaches forward and stabs one thin finger down on a portion of the dash; it lights up, as a radio signal is radiated out from the rumbling car to a hidden transmitter. A tape deck clicks into 'Play', and from four artfully-placed hidden speakers the wailing sound of an approaching police siren can be heard.

The crowd starts to thin out in a hurry. Spider pulls up next to the four bikes.

Johnny and Janice have an easier time moving through the crowd, and reach the car (and the motorcycles) at the same time as the bottle-tossing biker and his friends. It's obvious that nothing you say is going to prevent him from taking offense; he's ready to pick a fight with Johnny.

"Gentlemen? We don't want any injuries. Perhaps you could simply let us pass?" Janice holds her hands away from her pockets, Johny still behind her.

The lead biker slurs drunkenly, "Yer goddamn noise isz wreckin' my drunk, ya damn pansy-ass!" He takes a powerful but off-axis punch at Janice.

JohnnyZ slides to a halt, frowning. "C'mon, gentlemen, I'm just trying to make an honest living..."

As one of the butt-ugly thugs charges her, Janice sighs. A small side step, a small application of leverage, and the thug turns in the air, landing on a motorcycle and knocking it over.

JohnnyZ slides past the crowd, leaping into the back seat, synth in his arms. "Thank you, you've been a great audience. Smiling as Janice take the front, the wheels spin, squealing as the car peels out of the lot."

Spider skillfully guides the car out onto the main drag and off into the night. In the rear-view mirror, the lead biker is visible, alternately kicking his machine and flipping the bird at your taillights. Spider's fake sirens are soon replaced by real ones, but when the police show up maybe ten minutes later; most of the club patrons have left, including rowdies.
