# Inizii 2001-12-23

The late morning sun shines over Troll Rock, the sun's rays playing across the frozen surface of the pond between rocky outcrops. Three horses stand, just a few hundred feet from the rock and the outcroppings nearby. Bodan, Derleth, and Kyrel sit in their saddles; Vane, unfortunately, is still recuperating, and after some fuss from the others, gave up to stay within the priests' care to recover from the attack the night before.

Kyrel sighs, blinking in the morning light. "Well, we're here. Now what? Anyone see anything promising?"

Bodan asks, "So, this Troll Rock? Where did friend tell you to look?"

Derleth looks about with a hawk's eyes, more than a little tense as he scans the earth and rock. "Nae yet.... an' she didnae say 'zactly where, 'cept here, at Troll Rock, sirrah."

Kyrel swings down from the saddle, leaving Maya loose-hobbled to graze. "I guess we just search, then. Start at the Rock itself and spiral outward until we find something that looks like an opening."

Off in the distance, along one of the sides of the rocky outcrops, facing the frozen waters, a cave opens onto the surface. From this distance, it's hard to distinguish, but a there is a second hole along the base of Troll Rock; the opening of the supposed shocker lizard lair.

Derleth points towards the cave entrance. "That looks promising..."

Bodan dismounts, teathers his horse and begins walking. "He not sit about above ground. We check cave?"

Kyrel says, "As good a place as any to start." He rummages through his saddlebags, pulling out a few bits of material components and an unlit torch. "Hole first, just to be safe, and then the cave."

Derleth looks dully at Kyrel. "Aye an just 'oo d'ye suppose ye're going to get t' check it out, hmm?

Kyrel grins. "I was thinking we might find a cooperative little fox, donchaknow."

Derleth sighs. "An' 'ow did ah know ye were gonna say that...."

Bodan tilts his head at Kyrel, puzzled, "Where we get fox? Why not just go search cave...?"

Kyrel holds a finger up. "Watch, and learn, Bodan."

Derleth hops down off his horse, gives Platinum the command to stay and guard, and then abruptly shrinks down into the form of a familiar-looking snowfox. The paladin looks quite astonished. "Oh."

Derleth-as-fox looks expectantly at Kyrel, not planning on going into the hole without a light source.

Kyrel smiles. "He's quite a versatile fellow, our cleric." He mutters a few arcane words and the torch bursts into magical flame, burning without consuming the pitch. "There you go. Although you ought to be able to use your nose and ears as a fox."

Derleth takes the torch gingerly into his mouth and sets off towards the hole, disappearing into it. The fox-cleric finds that the hole is quite roomy; he, or young adolescents could have fit down it easily, even in human form. It twists, and turns, before coming out into a small den, if it could be called that. The smell of lingering ozone is strong in the air; a few green scales litter the ground here and there, along with the bones of small animals. However, the most prominent thing is the large box in the middle of the den. It would've been hell trying to get it down the tunnel, but it seems suitable for the squat, short monster that the trio hunts for.

Derleth-as-fox looks curiously at the box. Setting the torch down, he circles it without touching it, studying and sniffing the out-of-place object. It smells a little scorched, and there are marks here and there along the wood, but overall it seems solid.

Part of the wood looks as though dirt had been rubbed into it; there is even a stone wedged between two boards, at one place. The dimensions of the tunnel walls suggest that the coffin had been pushed, rather forcefully, down into the hole.

Derleth-as-fox whuffs, and then bolts out of the chamber, leaving the torch behind. Once out of the hole, he barks loudly to get the attention of the other two.

Kyrel says, "No, I don't have another torch spell. What'd you do with the first one?"

Derleth changes back into human form. "Oh, left it daewn thar with the coffin," he says offhandedly.

Kyrel just ... blinks. "Interesting. Can we get down there? If they managed to get a coffin in, we should fit..."

Derleth shakes his head. "Room fer me, in human form, but ye and th' Sir are too big. There's barely 'nough room for me to open the silly thing. Also, it looks like it belongs t' the dwarf: it's too small t be....one o' his servants. Ah dinnae suppose ye have any diggin' spells in yer repetoire?"

Kyrel says, "No, actually, I don't. Not my sort of thing. Are you sure I couldn't squeeze in? I'm longer than a dwarvish coffin, but I'm also a bit more flexible."

Kyrel says, "You didn't check if it was occupied, I take it?"

Derleth grimaces. "ye can try...but it's nae a straigh line, the tunnel. Ye might end up stuck, bent intae an 's' shape." He shakes his head. "Wanted t' get yer advice first...asleep or nae, ah dinnae want to mess wi' the dwarf with so little room t' manuever."

Kyrel says, "I'll risk it, I think. If he's sleeping, we might be able to end this quickly... hmm. Any chance of getting the coffin back out?"

Derleth says, "Hard. But 'e put it daewn there...coul' get it out."

Bodan looks disappointed. "Me not fit down there."

Derleth scratches his chin thoughtfully. "Ah might be able t' dig it out a bit, make it easier..."

Kyrel considers. "He might be in it, or it might be a backup for him. We'll have to look inside. If he's not there, we can just bust it up and make sure he can't use it."

Derleth glances at Bodan. "Ye got a blade about what I might cut 'is head off wi'?"

Bodan shakes his head, "Not me. Just hammer."

Derleth grimaces. "Guess I get t' saw through his neck wi' a dagger..."

Kyrel says, "I've got a hatchet. For cutting firewood."

Derleth ahs. "That'll do."

Bodan says, "Thought we must drag him into light."

Kyrel says, "It'll help, but it'll be easier if his head's off already."

Derleth abruptly turns back into the fox, and disappears into the hole. Dirt comes flying out after a few short moments.

Bodan turns to Kyrel, "What kill these things? Sun, stakes...?"

About thirty minutes later, a dirt-caked, panting little foxie appears, and shakes himself, sending dirt splattering everywhere.

Kyrel says, "Sun will do it. Staking through the heart will do it. And stuffing the mouth full of garlic and cutting off the head will do it."

Bodan peers down at the little fox, "Will fit now? Can we drag out?"

Derleth reverts back to human."Ye fergot fire. And apparently, ye need t' stake it _and_ cut 'is head off t'gether...."

Kyrel says, "Fire stops them temporarily, but not permanently, I think.... But we'll do all of them. I hope he's in the box."

Derleth glances at Bodan. "I were widening it fer Kyrel t' get down, nae specifically to bring it up....but the widened tunnel should 'elp."

Kyrel says, "Lead the way, then." He drops to his hands and knees and starts crawling down the tunnel. "I hope the kids got all those stupid lizards out of here...."

Derleth crouches down and prepares to enter...first emptying a flask of holy water into his bottle. "Twere nothing but bones down there when I looked..."

Bodan crouches down on his hands and knees, _This is going to be a tight fit._ He follows in behind, holding a stake in his mouth as he crawls.

The three make it to the small room, which Derleth and Kyrel barely have room to move around in.. The ceiling is rather low, so much that only a quarter of the box could be opened. The air smells distinctly of ozone, and carrion.

Bodan looks around, "You guys have any rope?"

Derleth retrieves the torch, and then jams it into the ground close to the hingless side of the coffin. "Ye ready, Kyrel?"

Kyrel nods to Bodan's question. "We have some. Ready, Derleth."

Bodan says, "Then why don't we drag it out into the daylight before we open it?"

Derleth says, "Because we want t' make sure e's in there first, Sir Paladin."

Kyrel says, "Aye. Why spend the time on it if he's not there? If he is, we slam the lid shut again and pull him out."

Derleth takes a long dagger, and cautiously lifts the lid.....his holy-water bottle in his other hand...

Bodan says, "He can't fight during day? Don't understand. Me give you room." He backs up into the tunnel while the others work.

The lid refuses to open. Part of it starts to give, but it seems to be nailed down near the center.

Derleth grunts and jams the daggerblade in between cover and wall, trying to pry it open.

Kyrel says, "Weird. Drag it outside and use a prybar on it, I guess. Don't break your knife."

Wood screeches, much more foul air spills forth as the cleric struggles with it. Derleth considers how tough it is. "Mebbe. Tis a fighting blade, so nae that thin...still, ye may have the right of it. All richt. My rope or your'n?"

Kyrel gags. "Gross. If he's in there, he's really dead."

Derleth wonders at it. '''is body wasn't in that bad a shape when we found it....nae reeking anyway....then again, we really tore him up..."

Kyrel says, "I've got a bad feeling about this. Let's drag it out into the light and have a look."

Derleth says, "Ye always say that. But this time, I'm thinkin' ye may 'ave a point." He starts fastening his rope around the box, tying a tight knot.

With some work, tugging and pushing, even digging at one point where the casket seemed stuck, the pair finally gets it to the surface. Derleth wheezes, brushing the dirt off his once-shiny armor. "Damme. That was hard work."

Bodan smirks at the struggling two, "Me could help you with that you know."

Kyrel sits back and rests for a minute. "I just hope it was worth the trouble. You want to do the honors, Bodan?"

Derleth says, "Jus' bash a hole in the top, Sirrah...."

Bodan nods as he holds his hand out to the side, snapping his fingers calling forth his warhammer. Taking time to aim for the center, where he expects the box to be the weakest he takes a mighty downward swing.

The warhammer whistles in, and connects solidly with the wooden casket. Pine groans, the box visibly damaged from the blow as the strike splinters the center of the top.

Bodan looks displeased. He takes another swing, this time sure that the box will break apart. The second blow strikes true, part of the coffin's lid cracking, some of it caving in. No corpse is inside, unless one counts the remains of half-eaten rats, and the curled up forms of two green, spikey lizards.

Derleth sighs, sitting back on the ground. "Well, that answers that...."

Kyrel says, "Wondered about the smell. Okay, we've had a nice warmup, let's go look at the cave."

Bodan says, "Me didn't see any off hand, but were there any other openings to that space down there? Me couldn't see past Kyrel."

Derleth says, "Bodan, take a moment t' remove the rest of the top....nae'r heard of vampire lizards, but let's make sure by giving the corpses some sun...""

Bodan follows suit and removes all of the splintered pieces, breaking the box apart even further, exposing all of its contents to the sun. A bit of parchment can be seen under the carcass of a rat.

Derleth reaches in with a gauntleted hand and grabs the parchment, unrolling it.

The inside of the coffin, and even the parchment itself, looks a tad singed. Apparently, the two lizards didn't appreciate being shoved into a box and trapped. In sprawling, brown and flakey ink, that smells old and almost...coppery, the stubby runes read, "Hello. It seems you've started to look for me. Ha!"

Derleth snarls and flings down the parchment. "Smartarse vampire...."

Kyrel says, "I really don't like this fellow..."

Bodan reaches down to pick up the parchment, "What it say?" He reads, "Oh..." He puts the parchment into his quiver for safe keeping.

Derleth picks up the heatless torch. "Aye. Lets go then. Ah've a mind t' feed the damned dwarf 'is gem."

Bodan says, "Think he be in cave after he put note here?"

Kyrel says, "Possibly. Might be a bluff. We have to check it out, at least."

Derleth looks at Bodan. "Sara said e'd be here. Wi' nae other alternatives, ah'm aiming to act as if she were right. And nae that she was ever 'is puppet."

Bodan says, "Guess we have to. Worried about trap though, may we not suffer needlessly."

Kyrel says, "We'll leave in time to back in town before dark."

The mouth of the cave is on the outcropping to the right, some ten feet above the ground, along rocky terrain. However, the only way to reach it is to cross the frozen expanse of the pond.

The cleric moves across the ice carefully, nearly falling on his armor-clad backside, but he does make his way across.

Bodan reacts to Derleth's slipping, "Watch out, ice cracked, shattered over there." He points further up the pond. "How solid this?"

Derleth grabs a hold of the cave wall once he's in range, steadying himself. _I've fallen enough already, thankyouverymuch._

Bodan begins to skirt the pond, trying to avoid any deep water or thin ice.

Derleth squints, having a hard time seeing anything past the glare of the torch qhilw keeping his balance...

Bodan edges across the narrow ledge separating the rocks from ice. He makes it safely to Derleth without much difficulty. He speaks up again, "There. See, movement below ice, is not too thick. Hope that movement ice or water. Come on Kyrel, but be careful."

Kyrel looks at the ice with distaste and edges out along the wall. He makes it to the other two without incident, joining them in a cluster at the base of the outcropping.

Bodan continues watching the movement under the ice, something just doesn't seem right. "That not ice movement after all."

Derleth blinks at Bodan. "What d'ye mean?"

Kyrel says, "More ice trolls, I'd bet."

Derleth sighs. "What a time t' be wi'out Vane..."

Bodan says, "Below water, some... things head towards hole in ice on pond. Ice trolls?"

Kyrel says, "Quite possibly. Might be other things, too. We'll see in a moment."

Bodan reaches back and pull out two javelins from his quiver, drawing them out of a space that they couldn't possibly have fit into.

However, nothing happens. For several minutes, the time simply ticks by.

Derleth says, "Mebbe they dinnae see us?"

Bodan says, "Then why they heading to hole in ice?"

Derleth grimaces. "Mebbe we shouldnae wait around t' find out. We're after vampires, nae trolls."

Kyrel says, "We don't want to get trapped between them and something else, though."

Derleth hrms. "Ye've got a point..."

Kyrel waits for a little longer. "But if they're not coming up, I don't see the point in going down there to fuss with 'em. Let's go."

Bodan readies his javelins to throw, "Go on, I follow."

As the three watch, the shapes under the ice swim back. A slight spray of water squirts up from a small crack in the ice, a hissing intake, and then the creatures move again, pushing at the frozen surface from below.

Bodan says, "Ah! Get back in cave in case they strong enough to break through, quickly, go!"

Derleth needs no urging and hustles into the cave....

Kyrel nods and takes a few steps back into the cave, setting Kiri to watch their backs while they deal with the water critters. He's only just gotten his bow strung when he blinks, and spins around as his familiar squeeks loudly enough to get everyone's attention. "We've got company!"

Bodan turns just enough to try to catch a glimpse of what Kyrel is talking about while still being ready for the creatures under the ice. "What?"

Derleth's head swivels around. "Besides the trolls?" he says, looking around for the threat.

Almost as soon as Kiri looks into the cave, he starts to squeak in alarm! A deep, loud horn blasts from the shadows. The ice in front of the outcropping starts to shatter and fall, and a sharp **crack** echoes through the cavern, as the pond ice splits. A harsh, angry, deep and vicious voice booms from deeper in. "You!" The sound of heavy footsteps is heard, before something large steps into the torchlight. It reaches nearly ten feet in height, gangly and familiar. It grips an enormous, spiked club in one hand, the horn in the other, and a beautiful warhammer rests on its hip. One look is all that is needed: Ogre.

Derleth groans. "And nae we're between th' ice and a hard place..."

Kyrel says, "Time to earn our pay..."

Bodan calls out, now not sure who to focus on the Ogre or the ice trolls, "Which one of us are you calling out to?"

The ogre is nearly thirty feet away. Its lips pull back in an angry snarl. "You! Short one, he say you kill my people!" The club swings menacingly, as the ogre begins to walk forward. "I come to warband, to join ranks, to get news! And what does I find? Ogres dead!" The sound of ice cracking grows louder.

Bodan speaks to the ogre. _"Surely you have the wrong people. I would be willing to assist you once the danger of these ice trolls has passed."_

Kyrel says, "The short one lies. We aided the giants and gnolls against the lizards in the north. If anyone killed ogres, it was probably him."

Derleth pulls his flail free of his belt. "We've nae time fer this." he growls, calling on his goddess to grant him strength.

The sound of scraping claws and whooping is coming from the ledge. The ogre looks at the half-orc a moment, before shaking his head violently, seeing Derleth draw his own weapon. "Trolls with me," the ogre snarls, moving closer, slower, more menacing. He reaches down, pulling the hammer from his belt after dropping the horn. "Dwarf says I get hammer, for killing you. Hammer makes fire."

Kyrel says, "Aye, it does."

Derleth says, "An' an Ogre's skull goes crack when ye crush it...."

Bodan says, "Time to retreat!" He throws both javelins at the ogre as he slowly moves into the cave.

Derleth smiles toothily as his Goddess's radiance fills him with greater strength...

The javelins hit the ogre square in the chest. It grunts, falling back a moment, snarling, before charging in. With its enormous size, long arms and enormous weapon, the ogre can reach the cleric before the flail comes into play; at over five foot of distance, it swings at the armored little man. Derleth dances aside, and the club smashes into the wall. The little cleric moves in with a yell as the ogre recovers and smashes his flail into the creature's knee, the bone giving with an audible snap and a roar of pain. Derleth grins ferally. "Ye didnae need that knee anyway, didja big'un?"

Kyrel takes a shot at the ogre as Derleth swings, but the arrow glances off his thick hide with only minimal damage. Behind him, the first troll makes it up to the opening of the cave. The scaley, white skin over its form glistens; water from the lake already starting to crystallize into ice on its skin. Feral eyes turn to the ogre, noting its fight, before they move to the seemingly inattentive half-elf. It grins, as it draws towards him. It is wary, however, seeing the torch, trying to avoid it. It edges around, and makes a single swipe with its claws. The other troll runs up after the first, but can't quite get around its fellow, waiting to get in, almost slavering at the mouth.

The powerful swing only grazes along Kyrel's clothes, slightly tearing them, but those cold knives don't touch the half-elf's skin. The ogre, grimacing visibly, swings his club at the diminutive cleric once again. This time he connects, the sound of wood smashing into Derleth's armor bringing a grin to the pained creature's face. Derleth lets out a grunt of pain, his ribs holding up to the blow, but only barely. He stumbles back slightly, but prepares to bring his weapon to bear once more.

Bodan notes that the ogre was right - the trolls are certainly with him. Seeing them run up the far side of the slope to the cave mouth to assist the large creature, Bodan begins to fear for the other two, who no longer have much room to maneuver or a chance to fall back. He only has one choice. Charging back up the slope at an angle to the trolls he heaves another javelin at the ogre and attacks the flank of the troll that just took a swing at Kyrel. The javelin skips over the head of the troll on its way in, and it turns, seeing the paladin come up the slope.

Derleth, having taken a few seconds to recover from the ogre's blow, once again attacks the hulking creature, the metal cube whistling through the air on the end of its chain. The weapon sweeps in, and strikes the ogre square in the chest. The cleric has to swing high to strike such a target, but the blow proves effective; the air forced from its lungs, the ogre nearly topples. A bit of blood shows on the corners of his lips.

Derleth smiles grimly. "Ah give as good as ah take, blueskin..."

Bodan calls to Kyrel from the other side of the troll, "Don'y worry 'bout me, blast these things!"

Kyrel turns as the ice troll's claws scrape across his skin. Almost instinctively, he drops the bow and chants the harsh syllables of the magic missile spell, and the three greenish bolts lash out at the creature.

They strike it squarely, hitting it in leg, shoulder, and chest. However, they seem to only stun the creature, and an annoyed, frustrated growl issues from its throat. It comes forward once more, clawing at its enemy, not caring for the fire at the moment, simply letting its talons lead....which isn't very far, as the agile and now alerted half-elf easily evades the ignorant, frozen beast's attack.

The ogre, limping, bruised, and looking half dead, moves back, away from the cleric carefully. He drops the club, changing the hammer into his regular hand, fire leaping from the head, rippling along its surface. He shakes it at the cleric menacingly, spitting blood at him.

Derleth's eyes harden. "Ye're use o' that weapon disgraces the memory o' the fine lass that wielded it. Ah'll be taking it from yer dead hide."

The second troll, behind the first, turns on the paladin, and closes in. Noting that the half orc has no fire and bears no weapons, it simply atttacks with its clawed hands. Those claws sink firmly into Bodan's flank, tearing cruelly into armor, cloth, and flesh.

Bodan steps up to the troll attacking Kyrel, ignoring the one that just took a lump of flesh out of him for now, calling forth his warhammer and bringing forth his holy wrath on the beast.

The troll doesn't expect its prey to fight back. The hammer pops into being so quickly, the strike comes so hard and fast, that the troll is nearly stunned in surprise. The first hard blow crunches against its chest, and with a squeal of pain it skitters back away from the second swing, suddenly becoming more wary of the half-orc. Bodan smiles and ignores it to press the attack against the troll facing Kyrel.

That troll has no idea something's coming from behind. The first blow is vicious, a sudden surprise that crashes into the back of its neck. It is dropped by the first swing, hitting the ground with a loud thump, the second stroke swinging high over its body. The creature's neck looks caved in, but breath still flows through its form, and already its icy blood seems to flow back into the area.

Derleth charges back into the fray with the ogre, pulling his flail back and then forward in a wicked diagonal overhand swing. The ogre, still having enough wits about him to keep the fight on, swings the hammer up, allowing him to deflect the flail.

After his initial reaction, the half-elf realizes that a fire spell will probably be more effective against the ice creatures. This time the chant calls a sheet of flame into being, Burning Hands washing over the ice trolls.

The troll on the ground simply can't move as the fire sweeps over its regenerating form, and the most awful smell rises from its burning body, steam and the blaze simply consuming the creature, even more vulnerable to fire than normal trolls. The blast hits the second troll, as well, though Bodan is out of range, and the creature drops, its back and legs reduced to simple mush.

The ogre, smelling burning troll, feels his time running extremely short. However, he plans on using that time as brutally as he can. Both hands lift his hammer, and, gripping it, he rears and swings it down, raining strokes of the flaming weapon on Derleth's head. He uses too much strength in the attack, however, and the weight the ogre puts on his bad leg nearly sends him to the ground, ruining his attack.

Bodan runs up to just inside the range of the ogre's reach and stands there, ready... defending. "You have been befouled and misled by evil. Your suffering will end here."

Derleth hesitates. He's personally ready to bring death to the ogre, but he's not in a berserk rage, and as the paladin calls out to his opponent with words of peace, the healer in him brings a pause to his attack...

Kyrel hesitates as the other two offer quarter to the ogre - he steps back a pace and retrieves his bow. He'll wait until the ogre commits himself one way or the other. _Might as well give him a chance._

The ogre, huffing and puffing, a steady, ugly wheeze coming from each breath, just glares at the two before him, his weapon wreathed in flame. He shakes it at them, welcoming death; _"Better to die a warrior, than to surrender, to be a coward, to not die an ogre's death."_ Perhaps words of peace would work on a sensible, uncorrupted creature, but the vampire's gaze, his instructions, stay in the ogre's mind, polluting it. He brings his hammer up, showing his willingness to continue, to die with weapon in hand. Bloody teeth sneer in response to the offer.

Derleth square his shoulders. "May Gythaxis have mercy on your soul...." he growls in response, leaping to the attack!

The swing is turned aside, once more, a sweep of the ogre's hammer parrying the mace. He spits at the cleric, letting out a whoop of delight. "No pity needed from human gods!"

Even as the ogre parries Derleth's strike, though, the paladin moves up, his hands taking firm grip upon the blessed hammer. _"No! Ilmater, through me, shall purge you of suffering!"_ With that, the hammer is brought forward, the head plowing into the ogre's chest. The sound of ribs shattering beneath the blow echos through the chamber, bone spearing into the ogre's heart. He staggers, swaying, and lifts the hammer up in defiance of death, before his broken knee simply gives way, his strength leaves, and he falls, as if a trap had snapped shut on life. The ogre's corpse simply falls, a large pile of flesh and hide and death.

Derleth smiles grimly. "Ill fortune for me is sometimes luck for my comrades..." He steps over to the corpse, eyeing Sara's hammer. After a moment, he pries it from the ogre's lifeless fingers, and slides the weapon into his belt wordlessly.

Derleth moves to Bodan's side unsummoned, and calls on his goddess to heal his compatriot's wounds.

Kyrel sighs, and bends down to pick up the torch again. "We're on the right track, I suspect. Unless the little slug is building all sorts of dead ends..."
