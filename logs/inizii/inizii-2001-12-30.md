# Inizii 2001-12-30

Kyrel leads the way out of town, heading a touch east of north in the wake of the retreating vampires and his scouting familiar. Kiri is communicating more and more worry - he's being chased by a _big_ bat. Bodan follows close behind at running pace pushing hard in his heavy armor to keep up with Kyrel.

The pair quickly leave the town behind, and soon, to the very sharpest of ears, the sound of flapping wings can be heard. In the distance, trees loom in the light offered by moon and stars. The _skree_ of the fleeing bat is heard, and then a large, dark shape is spotted, some ways up in the air. As the pair approach it becomes obvious that Kiri is dwarfed by his pursuer. He is trying to get lower to the ground, but the larger one keeps swooping below him, herding the poor familiar higher. Kiri is definitely more manueverable than his opponent, but the larger one is much faster. When they are finally close enough to see clearly, the predator looks enormous, its wingspan nearly eight and a half feet.

Bodan, noticing the fluttering pair, perks up and asks, huffing, "That your bat, right? Small one?" Kyrel nods. "Aye, that he is. Let's take out the big one." He starts with a brief incantation, aiming a spell of sleep at the larger bat. Bodan looks around for some larger rocks, having run out of javelins during the battle in town.

Even though the wizard can tell that his target was in the area of effect, the spell simply doesn't work on it; the large creature still chases Kiri, not even slowed by the enchantment. The half-elven mage grimaces as the sleep spell bounces, and his fingers move as he mutters another set of arcane words. A lightning bolt leaps up from his hands toward the creature harassing his familiar. _Dive for me, Kiri, as soon as the spell goes off!_

Kiri does indeed dive when the bolt zigzags through the air, but the larger bat doesn't even seem fazed, flying straight through the streak of lightning. However, Kyrel seems to have annoyed it to no end, for its course changes and it comes flying straight toward him, instead.

Bodan finds some suitable rocks while Kyrel continues casting. He looks up, aiming at the large of the two forms and heaves the first rock at the creature just after Kyrel's magic lights up the sky.

The dire bat may be less agile than the familiar, but it is fast enough to dodge the stone and keep on coming. The second stone is too far off its mark to even divert the bat's attention. Kiri dodges it again, keeping out of the dire bat's direct path, and taking a roundabout route to Kyrel.

Kyrel has time for one last spell as the dire-bat flies in for the attack, and suddenly there are nine copies of the mage, spreading out in all directions and moving through each other to confuse the senses. The dire bat pulls up before reaching Kyrel, flying just over his head, and circling around, the _skree_ of its echolocation audible as the creature is confused by the illusory copies of its target. The bat swoops downward, landing some ten feet off. Just as it nears the ground, its body starts to pulse and shimmer, and as it touches ground it transforms. In place of a bat, a wolf stands, nine foot at the shoulder and with fur of midnight black. It audibly sniffs the air.

Bodan drops the rock in hand and charges forward at the shapechanger. He doesn't call forth his warhammer this time, but instead attempts to tackle the creature. "Come on!"

As the paladin nears, the wolf snarls and lunges. Its enormous, fanged mouth bites deep into the half-orc's thigh, and jerks back to tear at his flesh. Despite the pain, the knight of suffering is able to pull back, staying on his feet as the wolf makes a vain attempt to yank him to the ground. His attempt to pin the wolf is unsuccessful, the wolf simply bucking the armored knight off, though its jaws release his leg.

Kiri, relieved that he's now safe, flutters back to the illusionist and flits around his head, wanting into the protective spot in Kyrel's tunic. The half-elf takes advantage of the wolf's distraction to ready his bow. Kiri flutters into his face briefly, but lands on his shoulder in response to a terse order. The shaft flies true, lodging in the creature's shoulder, but not doing much damage. It howls angrily, before viciously returning to its attack on the half-orc.

Bodan yells out to Kyrel, "Not sure can hold huge thing! Maybe need other plan!" The wolf comes on strong at Bodan, its jaws sinking into his shoulder. Even as the wicked bite sinks in, the wolf pushes with its front paws, and with a jerk of its head and a shove, the dire wolf sends Bodan to the ground. Bodan rolls with the push and gets back up, calling forth his warhammer when he realizes that he's not going to be able to take down this large creature with just his bare hands.

The wolf draws back, and with a quick move, dodges the first strike by the hammer. The wolf backs up, however, looking into the distance, before glaring at Bodan with obviously intelligent eyes.

Kyrel frowns and pulls one of the magic arrows from his quiver this time. He takes aim at the creature and lets it fly. The streaking arrow flies harmlessly over the beast. An audible snort, a lupine laugh, comes from it, before it backs off some more, moving cautiously out of Bodan's range. With its fur bristled up on its back and haunches, the beast seems even larger then it is. It stands there, daring the half-orc to approach.

Bodan steps up bravely, or perhaps foolishly, and makes an all out attack at the beast. The paladin's god must have smiled, for both swings connect. The first smashes brutally against the wolf's jaw, and the second crashes into its shoulder. A pained howl escapes it. Kyrel moves a little and sends another arrow streaking at the beast as the paladin moves to confront it. The wolf turns slightly to intercept Bodan, but the arrow scores its flank, rising another howl of alarm, as the magicked head hurts it much more than the first few strikes did. It glances around, glaring at the paladin, snarling. The wolf doesn't look beaten, but its form becomes mist, the large animal melting into vapor. The paladin's final strike simply parts the mist, passing through it harmlessly.

Bodan growls, then kneels, placing his hand on his wounded leg. He chants, "Ilmater, take upon you my suffering and be greater. Bless me with your own pain so that I may take the suffering of others once more."

Kyrel snarls as the creature turns to mist. _This one is still dangerous, that was a voluntary shift. The creature still retains its volition._ He watches it drift away... _At least we have a direction. I **really** hate undead...._

The mist drifts toward the edge of the woods, and hovers, then begins to solidify. In its place, a battered, smaller version of the black wolf materializes. It glares at the two, almost as if it wants to continue the fight - but then it turns, tail flicking in annoyance as if at some unwanted summons, and runs into the forest.

Kyrel stares after the departing beast for a moment, then shakes his head. "No. Far too dangerous. There might very well be others, and it might be shamming the extent of its injuries. Back to town."

Bodan stands, looking at the forest where the wolf vanished before walking back to Kyrel with a slight limp. His warhammer vanishes once again.

Kyrel gently takes Kiri from his shoulder, checking him to make sure that he's unhurt, while 'talking' to him to determine what he saw before the whatever-it-was attacked. Kiri chirps in response to Kyrel, relating what happened. The little bat, over his fright, flies around, happy to take advantage of the spell-warmth in the frigid air while he can... but he doesn't stray far from the mage.

Kyrel says, "Not good. The thing wasn't heading straight back to its coffin after all, but apparently deliberately led toward an ambush... He obviously made plans in case we didn't go for blackmail." Bodan nods. "Thing has powerful forms to change into. Is dangerous to fight."

---

The pair returns to the tavern once they have gotten back to town. A few people are huddled inside, some unable to feel secure in their homes this night, preferring a big, public place with others.

Derleth appears at that moment at the foot of the stairs, clomping down to give something back to the inkeeper. "Me thanks for the herbs, sirrah."

Kyrel sighs and sits down, nodding tiredly to Derleth. "It got away. He had backup. We'll need to find where he's lairing, but it could be almost anywhere within ten miles of town." He thinks about that for a momoent. "No, actually.. within seven miles of where we fought the big bat. We'll narrow it down if we keep doing this... but we have to look tomorrow."

Bodan limps towards the stairway. "Must rest after battle. In morning we search for creature?"

Kyrel nods. "Exactly. Tomorrow, during daylight."

Derleth nods his greetings to the mage and the paladin. "Aye. We do yet need our sleep, don't ye know. Vane is't already upstairs, asleep, thanks t' some herbal aids. Hopefully, e' might recover on 'is own from the vampire's touch...if nae, we can only hope that Oghma sees fit t' grant the Tarlbren priests the magics t' restore yer brother."

Kyrel nods grimly. "We can hope. The creature is going out of its way to make this personal. I can't believe that the axe is just a sentimental token."

Bodan nods, "Good. Me go to bed. Rest needed for healing. Hope we get lucky. At least know direction to search. Goodnight." He limps up the stairway towards his room.

Derleth says, "Let us 'ope that the axe is nae needed to permanently put 'im down. We dinnae have much time, ah don' think." He turns to address Bodan. "I'd look t' yer wounds iff'n ye'll let me, paladin....surely the Crying God would wan' ye to be at yer best t' prevent more suffering?"

Bodan says, "Aye, you be right. I no worry to suffer, but suffering unneeded we try to stop."

Derleth looks relieved that Bodan did not need much convincing, and goes over to the half orc, wincing slightly at his wounds as he brings the power of Lliara to bear, Her soft light stitching his skin back together to its unblemished state.

The paladin nods his thanks, before making his way tiredly up the stairs.

Derleth turns back to Kyrel. "The townsfolk were a bit skittish after ye left, but I t'ink I bespoke them back into complacency. At least, they all went 'ome."

Kyrel says, "We should be done with this for tonight. I'm just glad we're not far enough north to have night until spring... we'll need to keep our eyes open, though. Do you want Kiri to keep an eye on you while you sleep? You're by yourself now that Kaz has gone south."

Derleth seems to consider, and then nods. "Aye, ah suppose so. Though I 'ope we'll nae have any thieves rummaging through me stuff again."

Kyrel says, "I hope not, too. But I'm not going to count on it. Our friend was smart enough to keep an ambush on his backtrail in case of emergencies. He might also have been smart enough to keep some of his folks in reserve to harass us later."

Derleth claps Kyrel on the shoulder. "Rest then, me friend. We'll need it." With that, Derleth clomps back upstairs, not waiting to see if the bat is in tow.

Kyrel sends Kiri after the cleric, and heads up to the room he shares with his brother to get some rest, too. Kai will stand watch while they sleep.

---

Derleth's room is dark, quiet, the cleric's things simply tossed aside when he prepared for bed. Kiri hangs from a crossbeam on the ceiling, the little bat watching vigilantly for some time in spite of boredom. Late in the night, however, a quiet knock is heard from the door, as if someone was trying not to wake anyone else.

The cleric isn't stirred by the first knock. A feminine voice calls quietly, after a second knock, "Derleth! Wake up, please, hurry!" She sounds urgent.

Derleth groggily grunts, slowly becoming aware of a feminine voice calling him. He drags himself out of bed, dressed only in his underthings. As an afterthought, he grabs a vial of holy water as he goes to the door, opening it a crack.

In the hall in near darkness, stands a figure. And, after a few moments, Derleth can discern that it's Sara. The woman is in obvious disarray, though, with her leathers dirty and torn, bits of twig in her hair. Cloak pulled tight about her, she seems to perk up when the cleric finally answers the knock. "Derleth! You're awake! Hurry, we need to speak, before the dwarf's minions spot me!"

Kiri chirrips as things get more interesting. _Boss? Got a visitor!_

Derleth blinks stupidly for a moment, and then he opens the door wider, grabbing Sara's cloak and pulling her inside. The door closed, Sara suddenly finds a lot of Derleth embracing her. "Gods, lass! I were worried sick about ye!"

She hugs Derleth back, but draws away, hearing the squeak of Kiri. Glancing up quickly, the woman pauses...and then nods to herself, noting it's Kyrel's familiar. Turning back to Derleth, she says, "Beware...the dwarf has his eyes and ears everywhere. I can't stay long, I have to speak quickly."

Derleth opens his mouth, having a million questions to ask...but then just nods, keepnig his peace. "Tell me, lass."

Sara seems to speak a mile a minute. "I...I went out to stalk the vampire, in Nemford. We fought... He wounded me horribly, and I limped off. He didn't come after me; some thugs came along, and he had said something about intercepting a thief...I don't know. But, he believes me dead. I've been stalking him ever since, following his trail..." She removes the broken stake, the rotting haft that was Ebrek's axe-shaft. "I tried to stake him in Nemford; it broke. I've been trying to pin him down since, but been unable. He's got traps hidden everywhere, guarding himself."

Derleth says, "Sara, ye should stay here and rest. We fought the beast this ver'e night...reduced him t' that black mist. We plan t' find his resting place in the morn and put an end t' him...ye shouldn't go limping back int' the night, wi' nae backup."

Shaking her head, she holds up a pale hand, showing her ring. "I need little sleep. I came here to warn you; he has eyes everywhere. I've had to hide under snowbanks, tried to do everything to mask scent, everything to hide from the beast and his underlings. However, I think I've found what the gem does! That is what I felt I must tell you; I hope you still have it?"

Derleth blinks. "Aye, lass. Tis what e' wanted...the gem and axeblade both."

Sara nods quickly. "Do you have them both? They're needed."

The door opens quietly, and Kyrel moves silently into the cleric's room as he sees the two figures. As the warrior woman speaks, his eyes widen. "Sara? By the gods, are you all right?"

Derleth points at Kyrel. "This one 'as em, actually. He had some crazy idee about remaking the weapon...Kyrel, look who's back..."

Sara turns slightly, and then nods to Kyrel, offering him a warm smile, before turning back to Derleth. "The gem...if linked to a weapon it... I've interrogated the dwarf at the Inn. He was created by a pact with darker forces...the gem has a link to him. It can't be detected, but it is a weakness for the vampire. If it's linked to a weapon, and damage done with the weapon, it bypasses his defenses, it wounds him greater."

Derleth blinks, and then looks at Kyrel. "What d'ye know. Ye had the right of it, Kyrel."

Kyrel nods. "I knew it couldn't just be sentiment. Vampires are more intelligent than that."

Kyrel sighs. "I should've talked to that dwarf myself. We ran out of time and I forgot to before we left. Sara.... forgive me, but I need to check something." He puts a hand out to touch her cheek.

She looks around, suddenly seeming worried. "I think I know where he's hiding. I'll have to check, however.... You said you turned him to mist?" she asks, urgently, to Derleth. "Good! Then he'll be easier to find, until he's healed."

She gasps, as Kyrel touches her, unexpectedly. She jerks her head back, turning toward him. "What're you doing?" Derleth looks at Kyrel as well, confused by his act.

Kyrel sighs. "Oh, my. Derleth... could you detect evil?"

Derleth says, "Detect...well, ah suppose that's nae a bad idee, see if there's anyone that followed Sara in...." He grasps his medallion and chants the necessary prayer....

Sara looks nerviously about, before simply starting to run toward the door. "I've warned you! Look for him at Troll Rock! That's where I'm headed." She speaks hastily, before speeding around the corner.

Derleth blinks, utterly flabbergasted. "What it the Lady's name...."

Kyrel looks up at Kiri for a moment, letting him recount the conversation. "She may have been telling the truth, or perhaps not. But... she didn't survive the vampire's attentions."

Derleth inhales sharply. "My gods...she's been turned intae one o' them?!"

Kyrel says, "Either she is trying to get us to kill off Ebrek so she can be her own vampire, or she really is fighting his influence to help us, or he's using her to set up a _really_ devious and elaborate trap and the gem/blade weapon is worthless. "

Derleth sits on the bed, trying to absorb all this. "We may nae need the gem t' kill 'im, if e's like a normal vampire. But...let us get our rest and talk of such things in the morn, aye? Ah suspect, howe'er, that she's not completely under. She did glow in response t' the spell, but t'was more like a taint, and nae like the dwarf 'imself."

Kyrel nods. "That's... well, better than I feared. She's probably telling the truth, then, mostly. Troll Rock it is, then, tomorrow. We keep our eyes open naetheless."

Derleth nods. "To bed then. Kiri'll keep watch."
