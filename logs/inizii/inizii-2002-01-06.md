# Inizii 2002-01-06

The boys are left with an empty library, as Sarah departs.

Derleth folds his fingers together. "I'll be very interested to see what Illiya has to say..."

Kyrel says, "Indeed. Shall we ask the head butler to send her in next?"

Derleth smiles. "Best to pursue the most promising lead, yes..."

Kyrel opens the door to pass their request on.

Jacob, who is waiting outside, nods once. "Could I get you gentlemen anything to drink, in the mean time?"

Derleth is in the process of fishing out his pipe, and filling it with tobacco. "No thank you."

Kyrel says, "Nothing right now, thanks."

_Not until I've got a detect poison cantrip ready, anyway..._

With that, the butler disappears. A woman going through her late middle years pushes through the door, dressed like many of the other servants, though by the look of the patchwork over her breast, she's been with the Foxmantles for some time. A little courtsey. "Morning."

Derleth lights his pipe, and takes a quick puff. "You are Illiya, Anna's personal maid?"

The woman eases into a chair infront of them. "Yes, sir. I've been Illiya's maid since she was three."

Derleth smiles kindly. "You are aware of why you were brought here?"

She inclines her head, a little smile. "I'm suspected of murder?"

Derleth laughs. "Well, you are aware of the murder, at least...but no, I asked for you in the hope that you could shed some light on a few events." He checks his notes. "Sarah said that she spoke with you last night, and just after that you went to tend to Anna. What time was that?"

Illiya considers a moment. "I'd... have to say around one fourty five. I was informed Anya had left the party due to a little illness, so I went to check up on her."

Derleth nods, puffing on his pipe. "And what state did you find Anya in when you arrived?"

"Mm..." She considers. "At first, she said she had a headache. So, I got a little medicine, and when I came back, she was trying to ensure me that it'd gone away. But, Anya has always been fussy when she's ill or feeling under the weather, so I took it in strides, gave her the medicine, and waited for... perhaps an hour, a little over, just outside of her room. Incase she needed me."

Derleth blinks. "Interesting...very well...do you remember hearing a door slam around two in the morning?"

Kyrel says, "Did you hear anything unusual while you were waiting?"

A shake of her head. "Anya's room is in the west wing, which is usually pretty quiet."

Kyrel nods. "Do you know of anyone who might have wished to harm the bard?"

Illiya pursed her lips. "I've not a clue, sir. Well, Anya has mentioned her several times... I personally thought the woman was a bad influence; I'm most certain Anya would sneak out to go to some seedy place to meet with gods know who... As young people are oft to do," She adds, grinning ruefully. "Anya'd mentioned the woman being a little standoffish with suiters, and if she's running around with a bad crowd, surely she's angered someone?"

Derleth says, "So, it's your opinion that Zaranda and Anya were friends, then?"

"I'd have to say so, yes. Anya would return from some ball or another that apparently the bard had intended, all full of giggles and stories of the two doing mischief. Hadn't seen the girl act like that since she was yay high," Illiya indicates with a hand. One more ruefull smile. "It's a good thing to see, I say."

Derleth taps the butt of his pipe against his chin. "Was there anyone in the household that disliked her?"

Derleth says, "The bard, that is."

"Jacob." At first she sounds unsure, before a confirming nod comes from the aged woman. "I'm pretty sure the buzzard suspects what I do. But he takes his job so very **seriously**." Illiya shakes her head, "So, I'd bet coin on him not liking her. Kill her? Now, I'm not sure he'd go That far..."

Derleth considers. "How loyal is Jacob, in your opinion?"

Leaning forward, "That's, what I think, keeps him going, dear."

Kyrel thinks about that. "What does Jacob suspect, exactly? That you cover for Anya?"

A wave of her hand. "I believe he thinks she's sneaking out and could get into trouble. Bring scandal to the house, or get herself hurt, or get pregnant or somesuch. Let kids be kids; Tamlin assures me other noble youths do it."

Kyrel nods. "He's right, of course. Though noble fathers tend to be much more worried about their daughters than their sons."

Derleth leans forward. "Illiya...if, as you say, loyalty is everything to Jacob....would he kill, for the family, if asked to?"

She purses her lips, eyeing Derleth at that statement. "Now, I don't think my opinon's going to help that dead girl or not, but... that depends. Jacob's very prim, proper, and by the code, so t'speak. But, I don't think doing something illegal for the sake of the family, protecting it, then I can see him doing it, yes."

Kyrel says, "Or, he might cover for someone else... but why would anyone want to kill Zaranda just because she was Anya's friend? Even if she is a bit disreputable."

Derleth chews on the end of his pipe. "If the killer was a member of the family, then, he would lie to protect them?"

Illiya shrugs her shoulders. "He might. But if it'd better the family to turn them in? I don't know. I'd have to look into Jacob's skull for that answer, sir."

She raises her hand. "But, I will say this. Anya did get into a fight with her father last night."

Derleth arches an eyebrow. "Regarding?"

"Oh, about the party, marrying a coin-worshipping cold fish, any of those slavering hounds down stairs, about loving someone else - Me, I think she's got a fella while hopping bars - this, that, and the other. I only listened for a little bit, then went back to my tossing."

Derleth hmmms. "And when did this argument take place?"

A shrug. "A while after the party had began. That's likely why she left the party, you know, but still, I was determined to give her the medicine just in case. There's some mushrooms and such that'll put someone to sleep in it, so one way or the other, she was going to get some rest."

Derleth nods, and then something occurs to him. "Does anyone have a key to Lord Foxmantle's study besides the Lord himself?" he suddenly says, changing the subject.

"Ah... I think so. I'm sure one of the maids does." She nods, and flexes her fingers.

Kyrel says, "Oh, by the way... what do you mean by 'tossing'?"

Derleth says, "And...Jacob?"

The aged woman smiles, and holds out her her hand, pulling back the sleeve of her outfit. Strapped to the old, brittle wrist is a little bracer with a single throwing knife in it. "My father owned a Tavern, when I was young. I learned to throw. Keep it up to keep my fingers limber, and for when I go out to run special errands for Anya." She rolls her sleeve back up. "But since the murder, carrying a little protection for a lady's health is always good."

Kyrel grins. "Ah... a very useful skill to have, I think. Good for you."

"As to Jacob," She answers belatedly, "He...could. Probably. You'd have to ask him."

Derleth says, "Being the head butler, would the maid in question give him the key if he asked?"

"Well, sure she would."

Derleth nods, and then sits back. "Is there anything else you can tell us? Any...strange occurances during the ball, or afterwards?"

A wry grin. "I rose an hour after sitting by Anya's room, and needed something to drink. A little wine usually put me to sleep - I guess another vice of living near so much drink - but I was out, so I was heading toward one of the sitting rooms. It has a liquor cabinet. Anyways, I saw lady Shamnur exiting her husband's room."

Derleth arches an eyebrow. "This would be...close to three in the morning, then?"

Illiya mms... "Closer to four, really."

Derleth nods. "Alright...and what was Lady Foxmantle's disposition?"

A chuckle. "Tired."

Kyrel says, "No surprise..."

"And then I'm sure she went downstairs to her chambers," Illiya finishes.

Derleth coughs. "Forgive me of the crudity of my question, Illiya, but...was this simple sleep borne lethargy, or....." He trails off suggestively.

The old woman chuckles again. "The Lady and Lord don't sleep in the same room, sir. Though, as I hear, they've had their differences of late, they could've been reconciling..." A shrug. "Or, talking things over. Lady Foxmantle did leave, I hear, because she was tired."

Derleth nods. "I did take note you said, 'her husband's chambers'...hence, the question. Can you...attribute any other emotions to her at the time?"

"I'd say worn. I didn't get a good look at her face, of course; it was a little dark. I didn't pay much attention to it."

Derleth says, "And, you did not speak to her? or her to you?"

The woman shakes her head. "Nah. I've not had much love for the woman."

Kyrel nods. "Your loyalty is to Anya, not so?"

Illiya nods. "Right. Shamnur never struck me as a warm woman, simply professional, and all that."

Derleth checks his notes. "Do you know a man named Leris?"

"Eh... Don't think so."

Derleth nods. "Very well..." He glances at Kyrel, to see if he has anything else to ask.

The door cracks, Tamlin's head poking in. "Fellows, just to inform you, my parents are home. Prepare yourselves," He says with a wry grin.

Derleth looks wry. "Thanks for the warning."

---

Rosalie turns to look at the fireplace. _Ashes. Those weren't here last night. How ... odd._ She kneels down, stirring the ashes with her fingertip.

Rose, after sifting through the ashes, finds a bit of charred lenght. It's smoldered and almost crumbles to the touch, but after inspecting, it could be what's left of a lenght of hemp.

Rosalie turns away from the hearth, dusting her fingers off carefully. _Rope? How curious. I wonder how Anyanka's bard died._ Thoughtfully, Rosalie turns back to the desk, perusing the papers briefly.

_Just financial papers. The family is more desperate than I thought._ Meticulously, Rosalie returns the papers to their drawers, before carefully considering the wallsafe. _I wonder if he had the money to trap this._

The careful inspection yields a lack of traps.

After some turning and guaging the tumblers on the safe's combination, Rosalie turns it just right, then left, and back right. Click.

Opening up the safe, Rosalie finds quite some items. A little jade statue of a pirate, a few gems, two platinum coins, a gold family crest, and a beautifully crafted, basket hilted dagger.

Rosalie smiles, examining each of the items in turn. _Perhaps not so poor as all that. I wonder about this dagger, though._ She pulls the dagger out, handling it carefully, and tries to spot any remaining stains. _I wonder if this dagger was used recently._

The dagger is old, yet well kept. Etchings along the blade look new and arcane.

_Arcane markings. How distinctly disquieting. I wonder ..._ Mumbling under her breath, Rosalie holds the dagger closer, searching for a tell tale magical aura.

The dagger does indeed glow with the telltale signs of magical enchantment. Rose, if she glanced up, would spot the little pirate statue shining in magic-aura.

Rosalie looks thoughtfully from the dagger to the little pirate and back again. _The dagger I can't very well carry out of here, but that pirate ... somehow, the bard was lured into the garden._ Finally, she carefully places the dagger back in the safe, and moves the pirate to her beltpouch. Locking the safe, she takes one last look around the room. _Everything back where it was?_

Rosalie seems to have fixed everything; it all looks like it did when she arrived.

Rosalie removes her goggles, stowing them carefully away in her other belt pouch. _Well, that was an interesting study._ Picking up the piece of rope, she turns to the door. A moment's work with the lockpicks, and she's back in the hallway. _Right. I wonder where the others are questioning people._

"Find anything?" Silniya asks, walking down the hallway towards Rose.

Rosalie nods at Silniya. "Yes. Several interesting possibilities. How did the bard die?"

"Strangulation, I think," Silniya says. "Derleth pointed out some bruises and rawness of the skin around her neck."

"Did you see any abrasions? Signs of ropeburn? I found this short short piece of rope, which would be completely unremarkable if someone hadn't tried to burn it in a hearth that is never used." Rosalie smiles, thinly. "So not something they wanted burned in public."

Silniya hrms. "I'll have to ask Derleth, but I'll bet there's some ropeburn. Where're the boys?"

Rosalie shakes her head. "I don't know. I was talking to Anya. And considering these walls have ears, perhaps we should discuss this over a glass of wine elsewhere?" _And if not ears, then certainly spyholes._

"Right. Sounds good. I found one or two things, myself."

Rosalie nods, smiling. "Shall we find the menfolk then? I'm sure a passing servant can direct us to them. Or at least to the butler."

"The hunt's on, then," Silniya boasts.

Silniya and Rose inform Jacob to alert them when the boys are done with their current subject. The butler summons them both, Tamlin easing back from the doorway. "My parents are home from their ride. Be warned. I'll go stall." With that, the fop is jogging down the stairs.

Rosalie smiles thinly. "I think we would be better off discussing our findings ... elsewhere." She pauses a moment, biting her lip. "Anya had much to say."

Silniya opens the library door further. "Well, looks like they're the only ones in here. If not, I'm sure Kyrel can spell up some hidden space."

Kyrel says, "Indeed? Illiya just now mentioned that she thought they were good friends. Didn't seem to be worth killing over, though."

Derleth nods grimly. "I'm still wondering on a motive...there doesn't seem to be one yet...at least, for killing Zaranda..."

Rosalie looks pointedly at both men, and then at the walls and doorway. "Perhaps, gentlemen, we could discuss this somewhere **privately**", her lips pulling back in a rictus of a smile. "The very walls have ears here."

Derleth glances at Kyrel. "Is that extradimentional space you can me secure?"

Editor:can make, rather.

Kyrel says, "Aye, it is... do we need to do that, though? We could go back to our rooms."

Derleth says, "It depends, Kyrel. Are we ready to leave?"

Derleth says, "it seems to me there's more to be done, still."

Kyrel says, "Hmm. How about the garden, then? One hates to use spells unnecessarily... is it really that critical, Rosalie?"

Rosalie looks thoughtful. "I think we have found answers, which will lead to necessary questions. And, m'lord, I have some specific questions for you."

Kyrel raises an eyebrow at that. "For me? All right... I'll cast it, if it's that critical. Kiri? Keep watch out here. Come in and tell us if anyone wants us."

Kiri chirrups in confirmation.

Kyrel casts the spell, and sets the rope in midair. He bows ironically. "Our audience chamber awaits, milord and ladies..."

Derleth says, "I wish this was easier to get into..."

Derleth grasps the rope and climbs up into the space beyond.

Silniya snickers. "I could've given him a boost... Too bad it's not a ladder trick, eh?" Silniya takes up the rope, and shimmies up, herself.

Kyrel winks at Silniya. "Or you could have goosed him, eh?" He follows the werewolf.

"It would've made him move faster, I'll wager."

Derleth puts out his pipe...the space probably doesn't have an air filter.

Rosalie lightly grasps the rope, before shimmying gracefully upwards. Once inside the hole, she kneels, and pulls out the rope and the piratical statue.

Kyrel raises an eyebrow. "Where'd you find that?"

Derleth says, "More to the point, why did you bring it?"

Rosalie smiles at Kyrel. "There are four things I have to report. Firstly, the bard was Lady Anya's lover, and she was planning to run away with her, rather than submit to her parents' wedding plans. Secondly, there is a secret hallway between Anya's sitting room and her father's study. Privacy is best guarded carefully in this household."

Silniya clucks her tongue. "Well."

Rosalie pauses a moment, considering the pirate and the rope. "Thirdly, this rope was burned in a hearth that is rarely used. A hearth hidden behind a locked door. And lastly, this pirate may have lured the bard to her doom. I was hoping, Kyrel, that you could tell me more of what it does."

Derleth says, "Wait wait....Zaranda was Anya's **lover**?"

Kyrel looks stunned. "That would ... explain a lot. I wonder if Illiya knows."

Rosalie turns to Derleth. "Indeed. Their love was deep; hence her collapse at the news of her lover's death."

Derleth can't help it, the blush invades his cheeks. "Well. Hmm. That puts a whole new light on things...now there uhm...a motive."

Kyrel says, "And more to the point... if someone found out - say someone who wanted to force her into a marriage - it would explain the murder."

Silniya nods her head, brows raised. "Well, huh. I guess what I found isn't as shocking..."

Kyrel says, "Let's see that statue. You say it has magic?" He casts his own spell of detection and checks it out carefully.

Derleth says, "It might not ever be that convoluted, Kyrel. Maybe her father did it."

The little statue bares magic, and after a moment, proves to be that of the illusionary school.

Rosalie holds out the statue carefully. "Indeed. Illusionary, near as I can tell. And yes, Sir Derleth, this gives several people a motive. And with the hidden hallway ... do yousee why I looked for a quiet place to talk?"

Kyrel says, "Aye. It is illusion. You suspect what? A change self dweomer, maybe? Look like someone else to lure someone away from her protectors?"

Derleth's voice got a little hoarse at some point. "Hmm. Yes. And you say you found burnt rope? That would be consistent. The death was caused by strangulation via ligature."

Kyrel inspects the statuette closely for marks or sigils that might give a hint to its uses.

On the bottom, there are three seperate words written around the base. Each is written in gnomish dialect.

Rosalie nods at Kyrel. "I suspect a ruse ... they also had a magical dagger, but it did not appear to be used, so I left it where it was. There is a small piece of rope remaining; is it possible to examine the rope to see if it was indeed what caused the death?"

Derleth says, "A nub of rope would not be particularly useful, I'm afraid."

Kyrel says, "Hmm... anyone here speak gnomish?"

Derleth says, "Not me..."

Silniya eyes the statue. "Well... if it's illusionary, it can't be too harmful to just start mouthing the words, can it?"

Derleth says, "And it's not as if we can call the spirit of a dead rope. :}"

Kyrel gives Silniya a sardonic grin. "It's not impossible. But it seems to be a lower level spell, so it's not likely." He picks a word at random and pronounces it, concentrating on an image of himself in different clothing, just in case it does what he suspects.

Rosalie nods, sadly. "A pity about the rope. If we knew this rope had caused the death, we could have narrowed down our suspects to those people who had keys to the study. After all, the door was firmly locked."

Derleth says, "The fact that it was burnt, Rose, is suggestive enough."

In response, the statue bellows forth, singing opera in a deep baratone voice.

Derleth says, "But, it appears that at least one maid had a...."

Derleth boggles at the singing statue. He quickly clamps his hands over his ears. "Gah! Can you keep it down?"

Kyrel blinks. "That was ... unexpected. I'm glad we're in here, that could have been very embarassing. Let me try another command word..."

Silniya winces.

Kyrel speaks another word. Nothing happens, immediately.

++Editor: uttering the other command word made it stop.

Derleth sighs in relief.

Rosalie says, "And the third word?"

Derleth says, "Maybe it's just me, but I consider that much of a lure."

Kyrel says, "Well, let's try the last one."

Editor:**don't** consider that much of a lure, rather.

Kyrel grins at Derlet. "You just don't appreciate opera." He tries the third word.

Kyrel speaks the third word, and the sound that follows is quite destinct. Three voices. "And the tird word?" "Maybe it's just me, but I don't consider that much of a lure." "Well, let's try the last one."

"You just don't appreciate opera."

Derleth blinks. "Well now."

Rosalie looks fascinated.

Silniya tips her head. "Maybe it'll sing something new, if you say the first word..."

"I imagine," Rosalie points out dryly, "that we now have a good idea how the love affaire was discovered. So what shall we do next?"

Derleth says, "Question the parents, mostlike."

Kyrel says, "So what do the walls need with ears, eh? Most curious. And most incriminating. Just a moment...." He stuffs the curio into his bag. "There. That'll keep it from listening to _us_."

Silniya lifts a hand. "Oh. That brings us to my evidence."

Derleth says, "Oh, by all means, my dear. Say on. ;)"

Kyrel says, "What did you find, Sil?"

"The footprints by the gazebo. There were only two, both made from heavy boots. But, after I looked at them after a moment, the prints didn't seem right. It looked like the dirt had been dragged down, and the bottom was packed. As it looked, someone stepped, then pressed **Down** after the step."

Derleth blinks. "As if someone were **deliberately** making sure footprints were left?"

Kyrel says, "Or they were trying to look like someone heavier than they really were?"

Rosalie pipes up. "Or they were carrying a heavy body?"

Silniya nods. "Staggering, lurching their weight onto one foot, or walking **back** over their footprints is another possibility, though..."

Derleth looks doubtful. "If were just from the body, then the footprints would have been naturally deep, though..."

Kyrel says, "If they were worried enough about leaving footprints to try stepping in their own tracks, why not just brush them out? Seems odd."

Rosalie says, "Where did the footsteps lead?"

"Leading to the gazebo steps." Silniya pauses. "Is it possible their steps were heavier, due to weight, because they were trying to walk quietly?"

Kyrel says, "You're the tracker here. Do you think that's the explanation?"

Derleth says, "It's rather easy to be quiet stepping on grass, unless there are twigs or dried leaves about, Sil. But you lookedat the ground closer than I did..."

Silniya ponders. "Grass is rather quiet. However, I imagine that Zaranda had some trained ears, yes?"

Derleth shrugs. "No real way to prove or disprove that."

Derleth says, "The person could likey have been just as quiet running as creeping, on the firm earth under the grass. We're not talking about tile, or even wood, here."

Derleth says, "Still, it's possible. Especially to someone untrained in matters of killing."

The tracker nods. "I would think that she would have sharp ears. Musicians do, no?" She spreads her hands, to Derleth. "There's a few options as to why, though. I think a good question is where are the boots that made the prints?"

Kyrel says, "Or someone being worried they'll be spotted. So we need to figure out who might have done it."

Kyrel says, "What if it's Lord Foxmantle himself?"

Derleth says, "Highly likely, Kyrel."

Rosalie sighs, hunkering down and wrapping her arms around her knees. "Then I will be in trouble. I promised Anya vengeance."

Derleth says, "And as far as the boots are concerned, Sil...finding those will not likely reveal much in and of themselves, if they are still around. The boots could have been washed, if there were any dirt on them."

Kyrel says, "Well, then you might not be able to kill in revenge. But I'm sure you'll think of something."

"But the smell, Derleth?"

Derleth blinks. "The smell of what?"

Silniya smiles. "Of whoever was in them last?"

Kiri flies through the little window of the space, chirping.

Kyrel grins. "Ah, yes... it's so nice to have a wolf in the party..." He glances at his familiar. "Who is it?"

Derleth says, "Well, that would be revealing, yes. My point is, how will we be able to tell if they're the right boots? The prints were not very distinctive."

Kiri flies around the little space for a few moments, then lands on Kyrel's shoulde.r

Kyrel says, "Ah, Lord and Lady Foxmantle to see us. Shall we? Oh, and very quickly, Rosalie... did you note the type of magic on the dagger?"

Derleth says, "Might as well...one question. Do we want to reveal we know about Anya's...ah...sexual inclinations?"

Kyrel grins at his familiar's complaint. "Well, you can stay with me for right now. Not to worry."

Rosalie nods at Kyrel. "Abjuration ..."

Kyrel says, "Not... immediately. Maybe later, if we want to surprise a confession out of someone."

Derleth says, "All right. Kyrel...I'd appreciate if you lead the questioning. I'm going to be doing something, and I don't want them to be watching me too closely."

Silniya glances towards the outward hole. "Well, I figure if one of them is the murderer, they'd likely know."

Kyrel says, "And if so, they won't be surprised. If we hint, though, the guilty party might look nervous. I'll have Kiri listen for signs, too."

Derleth tosses the rope down, and proceeds to climb down.

Rosalie nods. "And I will keep an eye on their faces, too."

Kyrel pokes his head out of the pocket space, ready to greet anyone who is in the room.

Lady Foxmantle looks along the books, but she seems certainly distracted. Lord Foxmantle looks both concerned and annoyed at the same time, pacing. Both look up as the rope hits the floor. "Ah! Kyrel," He says, attempting cheerfulness. "Come down! You look like a floating head, my boy."

Derleth shimmies down the rope, and then brushes himself off.

Rosalie follows Derleth down the rope, and bows slightly at the Foxmantles. "Milord, milady."

Kyrel swings down behind Derleth. "And a greeting to you, Lord Foxmantle, Lady Foxmantle. I wish the circumstances were better. I came back to check out a book in the library and found something far grimmer."

Kyrel says, "Tamlin thought it would be better not to involve the Watch until you had gotten back."

Shamnur courtsies poltely. "Indeed, gentlemen, ladies." Silniya slides down after rose. "Agreed," The lady says. "And, if you don't mind, I believe it would be time to call for them."

Rosalie raises an eyebrow.

Kyrel says, "By all means. We were looking into things at Tamlin's request while we were waiting... the problem is, how does one account for motive. "

Derleth speaks up. "Forgive me, but is that wise? The watch is good at it's job surely...but it seems to me that this occasion requires a slightly more...discreet hand."

Shamnur nods. "Of course. But, I believe the Watch are specialists in what they do. And, even though I appreciate my son's forethought, there could equally be suspicions arising from having others, as aposed to the local authorities, investigate and elect a suspect."

Lord Foxmantle glancse uncertainly at his wife, before peering back. "Ah... What my wife means is, to take the investigation off of your hands, since the authorities may not appreciate their job done for them."

Kyrel nods. "Even if we are currently in good odor. I would certainly not object. We will need to talk to them when they arrive, of course - Silniya and Derleth found the body."

Derleth spreads his hands. "It is of course your decision...but keep in mind this:if the watch is brought in, these events will likely become public....and who knows what...sordid details might be revealed in the process."

The noblewoman's brows arch subtly. "Indeed? But, such could equally be exposed during a trial, unfortunately."

Kyrel sighs. "Even more likely, I'm afraid. But ... it can't remain a house matter in any event. Zaranda was too well known."

Lord Foxmantle clears his throat, looking once more at Shamnur. "Yes, well, have you any idea who could've done such to the poor woman?"

Derleth absently notes to himself that Lady Foxmantle does not appear to be afraid of scandal...

Kyrel says, "We've been unable to determine why anyone here yesterday would dislike her that much. We haven't turned up a motive."

"Good, good. I mean, good for the household," The Lord puts in, tugging on his goatee. Turning to idly stroke a book, before looking back, "Then it would be someone outside striking her here?"

Derleth says, "Possibly, Lord. The absence of apparent motive leaves all possiblities equally likely."

Kyrel says, "Possible, I'm sure. But... who among the guests would have that much animosity toward her? Even the fellow she slapped couldn't have been that upset, surely..."

Rosalie sigh. "I must confess, m'lord, that I have promised your daughter, my good friend, my aid in unraveling this mystery."

"Baron Mycroft is certainly very thorough. He is paticularly stern with the rule upon the surrounding people of his spot of land," Shamnur observes. Husband and wife look to Rosalie at that exclimation. "But you've aided allready, surely. Then again... Would the Watch let you assist?"

++Editor: The lord spoke that last half.

Derleth looks wry. "Not if its leader has any affiliation of the church of Tyr. At least, not likely."

Rosalie spreads her hands. "I do hope so, m'lord. Perhaps, if you speak for me, they will accept my ssistance?"

"Of course," Lord Foxmantle says. Turning to Shamnur, "Please, inform Jacob to get the Watch's attention." The lady nods. "Gentlemen, ladies, if there's anything else I can offer in the investigation you've put through, please let me know." With that, she turns, moving to the door.

Derleth shrugs. "Well, that appears to be that, then. Once the watch has interrogated us, there would seem to be nothing further we can do."

After watching the Foxmantles exit, Rosalie slips along to Anya's sitting room. A quick run through the secret passage, a moment with the wall safe, and soon she's back. "The statuette, m'Lord, has been returned.

Derleth is sitting in a chair, and smoking his pipe again, looking frustrated.
