# Inizii 2002-06-15

The group had gathered in the foyer with Lord Foxmantle. The Watch arrived rather soon. Four decently armored men in the City's colors arrive, with two others. One, a somewhat stout, salt-and-pepper haired middle aged man. His cloak, made for city walking, is trimmed enough to bare the crossbow parallel with a hafted weapon, the slight bulge evident lower. Beside him, a much taller, if not younger man, close cropped dark hair. The taller of the two looks around relaxed, as the shorter steps forward. Lord Foxmantle comes up to meet. "Sir, a murder was reported?" "Ah... yes, but... really, these people know more then I do."

Rosalie smiles politely, from where she is standing behind Lord Foxmantle. Her eyes rest on the taller man, for a moment, measuring him. Then she turns to look at Lord Foxmantle, one eyebrow raised questioningly.

Derleth doesn't seem inclined to speak, more than happy to let Kyrel take the reins, fuming quietly as he ponders what to do from here...

Lord Foxmantle tugs at his belt, nervously. Salt-and-pepper turns his gaze, as does his taller counterpart, upon Rosalie and the others. "But this is your home. If you don't know much, then please, be on standby for anything that we may need. But, first and foremost: Where is the body?"

Kyrel says, "Derleth and Silniya found the body out in the garden under the gazebo. I believe Jacob moved it... Does anyone here know where?"

Rosalie shakes her head, biting her lip, and smiling apologetically at the taller man. "Was moving her a bad idea?"

Foxmantle looks to Kyrel, then back to the Watch member addressing him. "Ah... I believe-" "Sir," Jacob intones from the side of the room. "The body was taken to the wine cellar." Salt-And-Pepper glances back, a frown. The taller fellow idly brushes a hand across his nose. Turning to two of the guards, "Please, take it to the cool house. Our body man will be on it." The two men nod, and Jacob promptly leads them.

Derleth shakes his head without looking. "He said he'd keep it safe...get him to tell you where it is."

+++Editor: Move Der's pose before the responses, and Rose's after.

Tall gives a brief smile toward Rosalie. "It will depend, but in most cases, yes." Salt-And-Pepper looks to Lord Foxmantle. "Please, don't leave the premises. That goes for all of the household." He steps towards Rosalie, Kyrel and the others. "If you know the majority of what's happened, then shall we step somewhere private to continue?" His brows are allready gathering in a storm over his brow.

Rosalie nods, once. "Certes, sir. I'm sure we'd be happy to see justice done."

Derleth waves a hand dismissively. "As you like..."

Kyrel twitches an eyebrow just a hair. _Well, perhaps not **all** of us..._

Kyrel gets up to follow the watch officer. "We were here, so we thought we would find out what we could... being unofficial, as it were, I thought we might get the servants to talk more freely."

"Mmhm. Is there any private places that we might conduct this?" Tall turns his head, addressing the other two. "Stand by." The pair nod, before he walks up beside the short fellow.

Derleth ignores the two watchmen by him as he follows.

Silniya jerks her head toward the stairs. "There's a library that would work." Salt-and-pepper nods his head. "Lead the way." In an absent fashion, Tall glances at Kyrel. "You seem...familiar. What do you happen to do, around town?"

Derleth smiles to himself, then, but doesn't spoil it for Kyrel.

Rosalie turns to look at Kyrel, her eyes twinkling. _Yes, Kyrel, what **do** you do around here, hmmm?_

Kyrel chuckles. "Oh, a little of this, a little of that. Mainly research at the moment. You may be remembering me from that reward ceremony after we saved the city from Talona?"

Salt-and-Pepper clucks his tongue, and turns after Silniya immediately. She's the first one toward the stairs, brooding steps following her. A respective nod to Kyrel offered by Tall, before he turns, and heads up after his partner.

Rosalie follows the others up the stairs and into the library.

Kyrel smiles at the sudden change in attitude and brings up the rear, Kiri chittering at the others curiously.

Rosalie steps to the side, after entering the library. "Perhaps, sir," she smiles demurely, "we could all profit from introductions?"

Derleth usurpes a comfy chair, and chews on the end of his pipe, puffing occasionally.

As spots are claimed in the library, Tall finds himself a seat at a table, taking from a beltpouch an ink well, quill and a roll of parchment from a scrollcase at his belt. Salt-and-pepper nods, standing. "I am Banyan Oshlem, Leutinant of the Selegaunt Watch, of Homicide and Burglery. This here is my partner, Elucreh Hindershield."

Derleth eyes the men. "Luckbringer Derleth." he says as introduction.

Finding a simple chair to relaxe in, "Silniya of the High Forest."

Rosalie smiles. "I'm Rosalie Tarragonia. Anya's friend. She asked me to help if I could."

Kyrel says, "Kyrel Thalessian, Mage. And Kiri."

Kiri squeaks.

Derleth chuckles. "Familiar Extraordinaire."

"A pleasure," Elucreh offers, from behind the stoneset Banyan. "And, rest assured, miss Tarragonia, you're helping us all ready." "Quite," Banyan puts in. "Now, let's get down to business. First, why were you here?"

Kyrel clears his throat and starts. "We were invited to the party last night, sort of guests of honor I gathered. We came back today for various reasons... I wanted to look through a book that I'd only noticed yesterday in the library, and Silniya had lost an earring."

Rosalie nods to agree with Kyrel. "Indeed, Tamlin escorted me last night, and promised to let me read the book we found in the library."

Elucreh jots down something, while Banyan nods. "The facts first, but we'll discuss the party later, most like. After ariving at the Foxmantle estate...?" Silniya offers, "I and Derleth went to search the garden for my lost earring. That's when I smelled the carrion, and heard flies. And we found the body."

Rosalie shakes her head, sadly. "This was wholly unexpected. The bard was beloved by all. Her latest ouvre would have taken her far. And instead ... this. Anya, Lord Foxmantle's daughter? She was distraught."

As Rose begins, a second sheet is tugged aside, and notes stensled easily down. Banyan glances over, before nodding simply. "Yes. Well then, who examined the body?"

Rosalie nods at Derleth. "This learned doctor, sir."

Derleth raises a hand. "She was strangled. Not manually...probably with a rope or a garotte."

"Being a man of the cloth," Banyan puts in, eyeing Derleth a moment, "You have some knowledge of anatomy. Thank you." A glance to his partner. "Of course, Casisn will need to confirm that." "Naturally." Turning his attention back, "Was there any other marks, indications, or anything found on the body, paticularly something that was removed"

Derleth shakes his head. "Only some black goop under her fingernails."

\*\*\*\*\*black goop/black splinters.

Rosalie looks thoughtful. "I did find a fragment of charred rope in a pile of ashes in a hearth that is normally never used." She digs it out of her pouch. "It might be related."

"Anything else found on the scene?" Silniya clears her throat. "Tobacco, a pipe, and footprints. The ground around it was pressed, then dug deeper, someone pressing down again, or restepping." Banyan looks up to Rosalie, which Elucreh jots down on the first sheet. "Good." A glance back to Silniya, "Now, what credintials do you have to back the ability up?" "Eighteen years of tracking." "Mmhm."

Derleth considers the note in his pocket...but he decides not to bring it up. He's not ready to reveal the realtionship between Anya and Zaranda, even if the others are.

Banyan then turns to Kyrel. "Now, I know you had the Impression that others would talk to you more freely then the Watch, but why did you step out of your rights to investigate, instead of calling us?"

Kyrel says, "Tamlin asked us to investigate, as the senior member of the House present at the time. I had assumed that he was also notifying the Watch, but apparently that had to wait on his parents' return."

Banyan's lips purse. "Mmhm." He gives the wizard another look, before nodding. "Right then. Now, you've made the observations on the body. Next, I would like the information that you've gathered so far, if any, considering the staff is much more free with regular citizens."

Derleth looks at the others, not sure what to say and what not to.

Elucreh idly rubs his nose again, and looks back at his papers.

Rosalie says, "Perhaps I can help, sir? There were a few disturbing moments at the revel the previous night." She pauses a moment. "I recall the bard slapping one man. And the hosts were ... displeased ... for some reason."

Derleth adds, after a moment, "The butler also said Zaranda was lurking in the garden around midnight. That she was trying to be...inconspicuous."

Kyrel gets his notes sorted out while Rosalie talks. "Let's see...." He runs through the basic events as told by various people, and finishes up with the interview with Illiya. "Illiya - Anya's maid - had the impression that Anya and Zaranda were very good friends, and that Lord and Lady Foxmantle did not entirely approve. She might have been waiting for Anya for some reason or other."

Kyrel shrugs. "And yes, I know... that's pure speculation at this point."

Rosalie nods at Kyrel. "Zaranda and Anya were close; Anya is currently resting. She's still overwrought."

Onto the second page, a nod given. Banyan listens, as the information is jotted down. "Yes. Now, lastly, I would like to know where you four were, last night, during the supposed time of the murder."

Derleth says, "We had left the aprty by that time. We were in our rooms at the Halfway inn."

Rosalie raises an eyebrow. "Excuse me sir, but which time exactly would that be?"

"The time between one and three."

Kyrel nods. "We'd left around midnight. The night staff at the Halfway House can confirm that."

Derleth shakes his head. "Before midnight, really. Otherwise Sil and I would have seen Zaranda in the garden."

Banyan nods to Kyrel. "Thank you," He replies, voice as firm and neutral as always. Looking back to Derleth, "Which is where the earring was lost. Is there anything else?"

Rosalie looks thoughtful. "I think so, sirs. Were you aware of the main reason for the revel?"

"No," Elucreh replies, a gesture to Rosalie, while dipping his pen. "Please?"

Rosalie smiles. "Ah, yes. Well, the grapevine insisted that the revel was given to find a husband for Anya. And indeed, Anya herself confirmed this. She was quite furious at the notion of being sold to the highest bidder. Surely, sir?" She glances up from under her eyelashes, as she pauses. "Surely you can agree, sir?"

"I could imagine she would be," Elucreh replies. Banyan glances at his partner, before looking back. "Of course, we havn't spoken to her, nor the senior Foxmantles, and we'd best hear it from them, before beginning to make conclusions from partial evidence."

Kyrel nods politely. "Of course. I hope we've given you some useful information, at least. If you need our assistance in any way, you know where to find us."

Rosalie looks at her fingernail. "But what was most telling, sirs, was just how desperate her father was." She smiles. "It's amazing what ears these walls have."

Rosalie glances up again, her mouth tilted in a lopsided smile. "And desperate times, sir, make for desperate measures, would you not agree?"

Derleth blinks at Rosalie, wondering what she's playing at....

Banyan nods to Kyrel. "Yes. If anything further is needed..." Looking over to Rosalie, "A suggested motive. Very well. Play on; what do you know?"

++editor: Remove 'Suggested Motive'.

Rosalie shakes her head, sadly. "I regret sirs, that I know little. Although ... the snippets are evocative. A secret tunnel, the gossip around town, an evocative balance sheet. But the secret passage leads to Anya's sitting room, and Anya was **quite** angry. Mention was made, in fact, of imminent plans to flee."

Rosalie raises an eyebrow. "Perhaps someone overheard her plans?"

"Miss Tarragonia, I don't like games," Banyan says with brooded brows. "Riddles are for bards, and there's one less in Selegaunt. Continuing to play them isn't getting this case any further. What do you know, and in plain words."

Rosalie says, "I confess, sir, that I know little. I know that Anya had planned to leave with her good friend the bard. I know that Anya was not aware of the secret tunnel that leads to her sitting room. I know that Lord Foxmantle's finances are in disarray; he is quite desperate to sell his only daughter into marriage."

"The tunnel leads from her sitting room to Where?"

Rosalie sighs. "To her father's study. 'Twas where I found the charred rope."

"Thank you." Banyan steps back to the table, and looks over Elucreh's notes. "If anything else is needed, you will be called to the Watch buildings by myself. Elucreh, I'm sure you can show them the door." The sheets of paper are handed to the short man. "I'm going to go speak to Casisn and see if the corpseman knows anything, and to offer him suggested questions."

Rosalie nods. "Thank you, sir. Anya has asked me to help her; may I assist you?"

Rosalie does her best to look helpful. And unassuming. And useful. And all the other qualities a good sidekick should possess.

Banyan's face crinkles. "I'm afraid this is Watch business, ma'am. The professionals are here for it, now." Rolling up the papers, and slipping them into a tube, the short man marches easily out the door. Leaving Elucreh with steepled fingers, facing the rest of the group. A light sigh, as he again rubs his nose.

Rosalie looks thoughtfully at Elucreh. "I am ... not wholly familiar with the Watch, sir. Is there any way in which I ... we ... can help?"

Derleth just smokes the dregs of his tobacco, figuring as much.

The Watchman looks back up, looking slightly apologetic. "You must forgive Banyan. He's... a little in need of compensation. When the Talonite debackle began, he was initally on the Ilmaterian murders, and coincidently, one of the first to grow ill from the water poisoning. Since then, he's been a little demanding of his job." A cluck of his tongue. "And, that depends."

Kyrel says, "Hmm. One wonders if it _was_ a coincidence. The Talonites were quite adept at targetting anyone who started to put the pieces together. We dodged a couple attempts ourselves."

Rosalie looks eager and attentive, and nods immediately. "I've heard tales, sir. The murders were atrocities. But please, how can I help?"

Elucreh leans back in his chair, and eases his hands on the tabletop. "First of all, I'd like some cooperation. I get the impression I'm not getting the whole truth." He lifts a brow, smiling. "You help me, I help you?"

Rosalie nods, eagerly. "Shall we trade answers, then?"

Derleth says, "You're awfully free to offer to trade answers when the Watch doesn't know anything yet, Rosalie..."

Rosalie turns to look at Derleth, thoughtfully. "Yes. But ... if it's the only way I can keep my promise to Anyanka ..." She strives for a helpless look. "What else can I do?"

Derleth cracks his knuckles, looking at Elucreh. "if we tell you the last bit, sir...you keep it to yourself, for now. And you give us free reign to find out more, on our own. Else we walk."

"Well, you could withhold the evidence, and leave it to us to discover. Of course, that would take longer, and likely longer for us to find the culprit, offering them the chance to leave town, pose a threat, destroy more evidence..." He makes a rolling gesture with his hand. "It's up to you." A glance to Derleth. "I don't think I'm ready to offer that much. I can simply let you walk. You're not the one who seems determined to stay, though."

Derleth smiles politely at Elucreh. "Appearances can be decieving. What I can guarantee is that we're going to work on this with or without your sanction. Now....do you feel like having to work cross purposes, or can we cut a deal?"

Rosalie chuckles. "I'm sorry, sir. I am not usually so ... ham handed. It's concern that makes me clumsy. Perhaps, rather, we could meet for a drink, tonight?"

Elucreh leans forward. "Now, Sir, far be it from me to throw dirt in another's eyes, but you're threatening a detective of the Watch, and attempting to keep him from his duties. Now, I know that your Goddess holds some sway in town, so I imagine bail would be easily purchased, but that wouldn't stop me from keeping you off this." His smile stays, even as he glances back to Rose, "And, no offense to you, lady, but I'd like to get as much information as I can about this problem as I can. The faster I know what's really afoot, the sooner you help Anya, the sooner the Bard's killer is behind bars, and ready to be seen by the court system."

Rosalie smiles, wistfully. "I don't have much left to tell, sir. But, you see, I am bound by my vows, as you are by yours. And I promised her to help as much as possible."

Derleth looks hurt. "Now, who's saying I'm being threatening? I'm just telling you how it is...besides, locking up one of the people that recently saved this city from being a smoking outpost of Hell will probably not look good for you. If finding the killer is what's important to you, you let us help you. We have access to resources you can't match."

Kyrel says, "We are bound by an oath, in this matter. Let us say, then, that the key to the motive is likely to be Anya's _friendship_ with the bard."

Rosalie nods at Kyrel, and turns back to Elucreh. "And these friendships are always misunderstood, sir, aren't they?"

"Then, other then a drink, what would there be to having a drink over the matter?" Eyes drift back to Derleth. "If finding the killer's important to You, then you'll help me. And, you're not really helping yourselves by giving an ultimatum. There's a lack of trust here. I will not stab you in the back. But I simply can't give you free reign. There's a deal to be made here, but, I'd like everything on the table first."

His brows raise. "Duelly noted. But remember, that whatever it is, it can be a motive, and possibly not _the_ motive. Unless you know a vast more then we do."

Derleth smiles. "All right...here's my ante." He reaches into a pouch and produces the note. "This was found on Zaranda."

Elucreh rises, and crosses to take up the note. He slips back into his chair, and reads it. Expression neutral, as he folds the strip of paper. "All right. Definetly something worth seeing."

Derleth says, "And while you have a point that the motive we have in mind is not conclusive, it is...highly suggestive. Even if someone did it to frame the likely suspect of such a motive."

Derleth looks at the others. "Should I tell him?"

"Right." He glances toward Rosalie, patting the paper. "Now, I'm guessing there's something to this leaving more then simple friends." A brow raised. "Am I passing the snake?"

Rosalie shakes her head at Derleth. "There's nothing to tell. Yet. The murder happened only a few hours ago." She turns back to the watch officer. "What I'm suggesting, sir, is that we could spend the day in town, listening to the grapevine. The kind of time-consuming task that is difficult for you to do on duty. And then, perhaps, we could compare notes tonight? Surely a man such as yourself fancies a glass of good wine."

Rosalie looks confused for a moment, then ventures to ask "... Passing the snake, sir?"

"Am I getting close enough for the prospect to bite me." He smiles to Rosalie. "And, here I got the impression you wanted to help investigate here."

Rosalie nods. "I would greatly prefer to help you here, sir, but that ... seems impossible, given what was said. I ... would ... at least, if we compared notes, we could still help."

Turning, Elucreh glances to Kyrel. "You mentioned you were a mage. Of what training, if I could ask?"

Kyrel says, "Oh, this and that. Primarily illusion... which is unfortunate in this case, I suppose, though most mages can perform at least some spells of that sort."

"Such as becoming unseen?" To Rosalie, he turns. "And, as much as I appreciate the ear to the gossip, I've earned myself some contacts, from my earlier lifestyle."

Rosalie nods, sighing. "I ... see, sir. But pray tell, what was your earlier lifestyle?"

He smiles lightly. "I'm not one to bare all my cards, just yet, Rosalie."

Rosalie grins. "Then I see we understand one another."

Kyrel nods, with a lopsided smile. "Among other things. It does make guards suspicious of one's motives."

"Indeed." He slips his hand under the table, before pulling it up. The detective flips a gold coin towards Derleth. "My ante, Luckbringer."

Rosalie watches the gold coin flip through the air, trying to spot any irregularities.

Derleth catches it, and looks at it. "I fail to see the significance. Unless you're suggesting this is payment for the evidence? in which case, I am sorely dissapointed in you, detective. We do not want Zaranda's murderer for the aquisition of wealth."

"You showed me some of your cards, so I'll offer part of my hand. This is how it's going to work. You all are going to leave. Go get yourselves some lunch. Pick me up... a decent meal, something with a bit of chicken, and definetly some bread. But no fish; I puff up like a game bird. You're going to bring it back, and I'm going to give you my badge. And, accompany you with your questioning of the staff, and searching of the premises. Unseen, with your help of course," He nods to Kyrel. "You are right that you can get more then the Watch can."

Rosalie grins. "A fascinating approach, sir. Splendid."

Derleth arches an eyebrow, a real smile crossing his lips this time. "I'd say we have a deal, detective."

Kyrel smiles. "Ah... now this has possibilities. We'd be glad to help out that way, sir. I just happen to have a few of those spells on me.. they're good for about an hour and a half."

He rises, and offers his hand to Derleth. "All right then. Now, as soon as Banyan gets back, I'll inform him of the circumstances, he will agree - he owes me a favor - and I will share the information he gets from Zaranda's spirit. That is, if things pan out with Casisn. And, you share your information with me. Fair?"

Kyrel says, "Eminently so. Thank you." He waits his turn to shake hands.

Derleth shakes the offered hand firmly. "I'll drink to that, sirrah."

Elucreh offers a grin. "And, I'm glad for this agreement. Between you and me, I can't stand speaking to the high society types."

Kyrel smiles ruefully. "I can't imagine why..."

Derleth grimaces. "In that case, you may have gotten the better deal." he says wryly.
