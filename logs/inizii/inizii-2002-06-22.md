# Inizii 2002-06-22

After the discussion with the inspecter, the four headed, as expected, to lunch. A rather brief one, but, Elucreh's lunch was purchased. They hadn't been gone that long, but as they approach the manor, the guards at the gate seem much more intentive and alert.

"Afternoon," One of the guards pipe up, upon sight of the approaching group.

Derleth arches an eyebrow. "Is there news?"

"The little u-" "The shorter Watch officer came back, about ten minutes before you did," The other, more senior of the two interjects for his partner.

Derleth smiles understandingly. "Nothing wrong with diplomacy....at least till you can find a rock." he says cryptically in response.

The two guards chuckle, before one opens the gate. "The taller guy mentioned you coming back."

Kyrel says, "He sent us for lunch, and he wants us to continue interviewing the staff while he checks out other things."

Derleth nods in thanks. "You'll probably be seeing more of us..." he comments back.

They offer nods. As the group heads inside, a slight whistle comes from the shadows of an antechamber in the foyer. "Rosalie!" It hisses.

Rosalie hangs back from the group, her eyes probing the shadows.

Derleth keeps walking, but walks slowly, now.

A hand waves to the elven woman, a little quickly.

Rosalie looks around idly, scanning unobtrusively for observers, before noiselessly stepping into the antechamber. "Anya?"

Kyrel pauses in the corridor, motioning Silniya and Derleth to wait, too.

The young woman is skulking in the shadows. A quick nod. "Yes." She glances left and right, her voice low. "The **Watch** is here. I thought... you were going to look into it?"

Rosalie nods once, stepping into the shadows herself. "We are looking into it, Anya. Your father, as was his right, insisted on calling the Watch. So now everybody's watching everyone else."

Running fingers through her hair, "But... Why would the Watch let you do their job?"

Rosalie shakes her head. "They're not, exactly. The taller gent agreed that we could be useful. So for now we ... assist." Rosalie pauses a moment. "Anya, what if ... what if the murderer is someone you know?"

Anya nods, still looking a bit nervous and displeased. But, at Rosalie's question, she purses her lips. "Then, damn them for knowing what it would do to me."

Rosalie checks the hallway. "I shouldn't really be here, Anya. Right now they don't trust us any more than we trust them. Can you invite us for tea, perhaps, later on?"

The young woman nods, letting out a little terse sigh. "Atleast you're doing it. The Watch in all honesty couldn't finger a guilty larcenist if he had the gold stuck to his hand."

Rosalie smiles briefly. "I don't know, Anya. Elucreh seems smart enough. You could invite us here, or at the inn. But I really should go; if they suspect me everything will go haywire." A brief pat on Anya's shoulder, and Rosalie slips back out into the hallway, quickly and quietly catching up with the others.

Kyrel nods to Rosalie as she catches up after her talk with Anya. "Worried, is she?"

Derleth turns to continue on. "I wonder if her opinion on the watch is only her opinion, or if it has some basis in fact..."

Rosalie nods to both. "I think, gentlemen, that I should spend some time in the taverns. This could be important."

Derleth says, "I think I missed something. Why the taverns, specifically?"

Silniya idly trades hands, Elucreh's lunch in a cheap basket. "How much information do you really think would be on the streets about this? Or do you mean the Watch's skills?"

Rosalie nods at Silniya. "Both, really. It would help if we knew how good the Watch is, and there may be other rumours. And people like to gossip with me." She smiles, whimsically.

Kyrel says, "One wouldn't think that a high society murder would have useful information being bandied about in a tavern..."

"... but if you want to look there, go right ahead."

Derleth says, "on the other hand...going to an information broker like the Mill might be...lucrative."

Silniya tips her head. "I'd say it depends on the Tavern. I'm sure these High society types gossip just as much as your pick pocket. Not much of a seperation, there."

Rosalie nods at Kyrel. "And if someone was hired for the actual killing ... there are usually echoes on the street."

Kyrel nods. "Ah, yes... the Miller. Might be worth a shot."

Upon heading up the steps, Banyan's hight-lacking form can be spotted heading down a hallway, with an annoyedly swift pace. Pushing in the library door, Elucreh is eyeing a sheet of paper, before looking up. "Ah! You're back. My lunch! I'm starving. Thank you."

Derleth deposits it on the desk. "Can't catch criminals on an empty stomach."

"Indeed." Elucreh takes up a glass of water sitting near by, depositing himself into a chair. "A little good news. I took a glance at those footprints in the Garden, and found the boots they belong to."

Kyrel says, "Oh? May we ask who?"

Derleth blinks. "That quickly? The bootprint did not seem to be that distinctive."

Rosalie nods, attentively.

Kyrel says, "And of course, there's the problem of demonstrating that the owner was actually _wearing_ it at the time...."

"Thorvald Foxmantle's bedroom." Taking a bit of bread from the basket, "No, but they were a tad on the wide side. I was looking around the Lord's bedroom, and found the boots stuffed in a corner in the back of a dressing closet."

Elucreh adds, "Now, that, you have me." He glances at the sheet of paper. "And, word from Zaranda."

Derleth blinks, and then scratches his chin. "I don't like this. That seems...too easy."

Derleth nods for Elucreh to go on.

"Apparently," He says after swallowing, "The girl didn't see it coming. Her assailant got the jump on her, before she knew what was happening."

Kyrel says, "Not a surprise. Whoever did it knew that this would be looked at closely, with all the power you could bring to bear on it."

Derleth nods. "I figured as much, but it's good to know, at least. Was any useful information gleaned from the questioning?"

Kyrel says, "Lord Foxmantle is heavy.. and the prints looked like they weren't all that deep, at least not without being forced. Someone borrowed his boots, perhaps?"

Rosalie looks thoughtful. "Did Zaranda mention why she was in the garden? Or was she jumped in the house?"

Derleth says, "They might not even have been his, Kyrel...just thrown in his closet to cast suspicion."

"Or, they didn't want their victim to see them coming and put up a fight." Elucreh shakes his head. "No, it was a clean jump. She was in the garden, waiting for Anya." The detective eyes the four at that, continuing with his lunch.

"However," He adds, "She did mention a possible suspect or two. Outside of the home."

Rosalie raises an eyebrow. "She did?"

Kyrel sighs. "That makes it _more_ complicated... not less."

Derleth says, "Not necessarily, Kyrel...if Lord Foxmantle is not the murderer, then the murderer must be someone with something to gain by his downfall."

Kyrel says, "Not necessarily. Might just have been someone who knew that circumstances would look suspicious against him and figured that'd be the easiest way to cover their own tracks."

Kyrel glances at Rosalie. "Did Zaranda mention _why_ she'd been waiting for Anya?"

Derleth says, "Perhaps, Kyrel. But assuming nothing makes it impossible to even begin a line of detection."

"But assuming everything makes the line look like a checkersquare board." Elucreh gnaws idly on an apple. "Yes. Apparently, Zaranda was somewhat of a Dreamhead. She's owing a little bit of money, infact."

Rosalie says, "What's a dreamhead, sir? And how would that affect her debts?"

Derleth looks blank, and doesn't know either.

"A Dreamhead is an avid user of Mordayn Vapor, or as it's known to it's users, 'Dream Mist'. We've been trying to crack down on it, but it's hard; the powder is very clingy, and often smugglers, or anyone coming in, lets it cling to the inside of a sleeve, or whathaveyou, and walks in. The stuff is expensive."

Rosalie nods. "Addictive, too?"

Derleth grimaces. "I don't care for illegal substances. The legal ones are bad enough."

Elucreh makes a slight wave. "Slightly. It's very potent, though. It can be used as poison, too, so it's even more dangerous. But the growers are sneaky; it can grow in moldy areas, so basements and hell, even sewers are prime areas." A shake of his head. "Casisn couldn't think of anything to ask, since she didn't have much information, other then where she went to get it. Might as well kill two birds, as he noted in the paper." Elucreh grins wryly. "So, atleast we know where she got the stuff."

Kyrel says, "Indeed... Rosalie, you were thinking about checking the town..." He looks back at Elucreh. "From whom?"

Derleth says, "Somehow, I doubt that her creditors killed, her, however...if you kill the debtor, you don't get your money."

Rosalie looks around the library. "I wonder if there are any herbals here, that treat Dream Mist. The more we know, the better the questions we can ask."

A little chuckle. "Man named Larcen. At the 'Elven-Breath Hole'. We havn't found the spot though. Dens and hangouts spring up everywhere in town."

Kyrel nods at Derleth's remark. "Good point. If you kill someone over a debt, you want it known, not hidden."

Kyrel says, "And if you actually want your money, you make a point of killing some beggar who owes you, not someone who stands a chance of making good on their debt."

Derleth nods, "My other thought, as well."

Elucreh leans forward. "What would you say if, say, they made it known, and perhaps took down some competition while they were at it?"

Derleth blinks. "Are you implying that she was attempting to market this...Mist?"

Kyrel nods. "Possible... but I don't see a dealer doing it _here_, of all places. Too likely to get caught up in a serious Watch investigation. Too many important feathers get ruffled."

Rosalie glances at Kyrel. _I wonder if this house has any damp cellars. Dream mist sounds like a quick way to recoup one's fortunes ..._ "Perhaps she wasn't the competition?"

Derleth blanches. "Oh my....you have a point, Rose..."

"No, no." Elucreh takes a sip of his water. "The Foxmantles are spice traders. They deal with herbalism, spices, this and that. Now, this is all assumption, mind you, but say, one or two of the men in Lord Foxmantle's Caravan had it up their sleeves, quite literally, or some money exchanged hands, to let the lax customs officers be even more sloppy..."

Rosalie nods, then pauses, struck. "Could it be ... sir, what if the bard observed the bribes? Or the imports? That would certainly make her a target." She fidgets a little. _I wonder what I missed in that study. Assuming that's where they hid their notes._

Derleth tries to follow Elucreh's idea. "You're thinking that the real criminals were using Foxmantle's legit trading business as a screen for selling this Mist? And that taking down Foxmantle would then hurt the people in the shadows..."

Kyrel murmurs, "Wheels within wheels within wheels..."

"Rosalie," The detective asks, "Didn't you suggest Anya and Zaranda were going to skip town, together?"

Rosalie nods. "Yes. Anya was quite eager to avoid being sold to a husband."

Derleth nods to Kyrel. "This is starting to make my head hurt."

"All right. Now, imagine if you're a street seller. Some rich man is bringing in the same product you're trying to sell, he's bringing it, or making it himself, and selling it to others, or raising his prices to You... And, you have a debter who's about to skip town, and just happens to be at his place... What would you do?"

_And who can blame her? To go from father to husband, chattel to chattel ..._ Rosalie pauses sombrely. "But I don't think Anya knew about the drugs. I think it would have worked better as a warning to the father, if the father had fewer motives himself."

Kyrel shakes his head, as if to clear it. "Okay. We need more information. Who would you like us to interview next, Elucreh?"

Derleth chews on the end of his unlit pipe. _At this rate, the one ace we had left seems like a joker._

The detective scrunches his nose. "Honestly... I don't know. It would be good if we tried to follow up this possibility, but this is not the prime hours for that to be found. However, keeping up with the information here would be just as furthering." Looking over at Rosalie, "I would hate to ask you to snoop about for this _Elven-Breath Hole_. No doubt it'd be rather seedy, and dangerous. But, even with my...contacts, I don't think I'd be easily slipping into the crowd."

Rosalie smiles happily. "Why, Elucreh ... I may call you Elucreh? I would be happy. I'll need to change into something a little ..." she looks down at her outfit which is plain but perfectly serviceable, "something a little plainer. But I don't anticipate any huge problems."

Derleth scratches his chin. "In that case...I'm of a mind to find out more about that fellow that 'rides' with Lady Foxmantle...what was his name again?"

The detective leans forward, smiling up at Rose softly. "Most appreciated, it would be. I can only use what I can, sparingly." Looking to Kyrel and Derleth, "I'm a collective head with you boys; what do you think?"

Kyrel says, "Might as well start there as anywhere. I'm leaning toward the lady as a suspect, anyway."

Rosalie nods, grinning back happily. "Glad to be of help. It's early time yet, but I'll need a little time to find more ... suitable ... attire. Perhaps we should arrange to meet later, tonight?"

"Say... Eightish?"

Silniya steps beside Rosalie, offering a brief grin. "Wouldn't mind me joining you, would you? I'm sure you're good at holding your own but... just to be sure?"

Rosalie says, "Certainly. Say ... at the inn? And Silniya, I would be happy to have you watch my back ... although perhaps from a distance? People are more talkative when I'm alone."

"Which Inn; the one you're staying at?" Elucreh asks. Silniya simply nods. "I can be a little imposing." The forestwoman gives a look Derleth's way.

Rosalie nods. "Indeed. They do a fine supper there. Not surprising, considering the chefs. And they appreciate privacy, too."

Kyrel says, "That they do."

Rosalie and Silniya soon depart, while Kyrel makes the Watchmen become unseen. Badge in hand, Kyrel, Derleth, and their invisible comrad head out of the house, toward the stables. The smell of horses, hay, and barn smells greet them.

Derleth looks around attentively: he's already seen Leris once, so he decides to use his eyes before his mouth.

"Hey, Evvy, we've company," A scruffy youth says, peering above a stall, where a horse's head contently pokes out. Another joins the lad's. "Heyo, there!" Dusting hands onto old trousers, the more aged gentleman walks around. "How can I help yas?"

Derleth smiles kindly. "We're looking for a gentleman that goes by the name of Leris."

Kyrel says, "We're checking out some things about the murder. Were either of you on duty last night?"

\*\*\*\*remove Der's last pose.

Derleth lets Ky talk for the moment, continuing to look for Leris.

The lad shakes his head quickly, before 'Evvy' smiles. "Off duty, yessir." After the boy's steady silence, his compatriet gives him a poke, earning an agreeing nod from the boy.

Kyrel nods. "Ah, well. Maybe you can tell us about Lady Foxmantle's riding companion, then?"

The boy opens his mouth, to find Evvy cutting him off. "Which riding partner would that be, sirrah? She went off with the Lord today."

Kyrel says, "Not Lord Foxmantle. The fellow she rides with when he's busy. Lurris, or something like that?"

"Leris?" The lad chirps, earning a swift box in the shoulder, before Evvy walks forward. "Ah... ya, there'd be a fella by that name that comes by here, on occasion."

Kyrel says, "Any idea where he might be? We'd like to ask him a few questions."

A look quiets the boy. Evvy gazes back. "Well... Leris, he's not around here, lest he's going to be riding off with the Lady. She likes to head out've the city, into the woods... needs an able hand to protect her from a highwayman or whatnot."

Kyrel nods. "Quite right. Any lady should have a bodyguard, even riding around the town. We're trying to get statements from everyone who was at the party last night, though, and apparently he was invited. We'll have to ask Lady Foxmantle where he can be found, I suppose."

"Well, sirrah, Leris's made comments about being a dock tavernman. Said something about...ah, 'The Cutlace' or Curtlass... might want to go asking around there."

Derleth arches an eyebrow. _Huh. One wonders at Lady Foxmantle's standards._

Kyrel says, "All right. We'll look into that, then." _Right. Or it might be the worst dive you can think of and you're trying to get us killed. Why do you keep interrupting the kid, eh?_

Kyrel says, "Who was on duty here last night, if you weren't? We need to find out if they saw anything in the gardens."

"Elai was here," The lad pipes up, peering around Evvy's side. Though, the man doesn't flinch. "He usually closes up, sees to the horse in the evenings. He has a flat with his brothers on Copper street," Evvy offers.

Kyrel makes a note. "Elai. All right, we'll talk to him. When does he usually get here?"

Evvy grinds the heel of his boot into the dirt. "Around six, or so." Turning, to pat the boy, "Jesh, go get Nenny here some more water." The boy looks cross, certainly more interested in this, but reluctantly goes. Evvy then walks towards the pair, tumbing the last remaining belt loop in his trousers. "Ah, sirs, could you... not mention where you found out, about Leris?" He looks around, quick.

Derleth arches a brow. "Why does it matter?"

Kyrel chuckles. "We found out about him from one of the house servants, actually. We won't bring your name into it."

"Because ah... The lady slips a little extra silver into my weekly sums, to be hushed." He looks more bright, toward Kyrel. "In that case, then, y'might also want to ask 'round the _Wide Realms_, too. Leris... he boasts he's good on stage."

Derleth nods in understanding. _I suppose that's all the truth to be had..._

_Kyrel nods. "We'll do that." He slips a few silver out of his pouch and tips the ostler for the information. "Thanks."_

_Evvy takes the coins, and nods his head quick in response. "Thank you, sire, most thanked." He slips the coins into his pocket, turning back to Jesh._

_Derleth motions Kyrel away. When they're at a distance from the stable boys, he murmurs, "Where to now?"_

_Kyrel says, "Back to the house servants, I guess. We've still got a few to chat with about the party."_

_Kyrel says, "Do you have any suggestions, Elucreh?"_

_"And, of the Lord and Lady?" Offers the unseen detective._

_Derleth purses his lips. "You think we should seek them out? They could be anywhere. And we have nothing to use for scrying, for either of them."_

_"I would think that questioning them without magical aid is just as doable."_

_Kyrel says, "I suppose. Though they might be more likely to answer the Watch. They were the ones trying to run us off, you recall."_

_"I could try to get Banyan on it..."_

_Kyrel says, "We'll try, first. Worst they can do is say no."_

_Derleth says, "But didn't they just say they went out riding? How are we to find them?"_

_"I would say that you do have my badge, you know."_

_Kyrel says, "Ah... a good point. Heh. Forgot about that..."_

_\*\*\*\*\*\*Delete Der's last pose._

_After leaving the stables, Elucreh in towe, they find Lady Foxmantle in her own parler, with a book. She rises, as they enter. "Good Afternoon, Gentlemen."_

_Kyrel bows. "Lady Foxmantle. May we ask you a few questions about last night?"_

_Derleth once again lets Kyrel take the lead, instead looking about at the contents of the parlor..._

_"Certainly," She replies, easing back onto a love seat. "Would you care to sit?"_

_Kyrel says, "Thank you." He takes a seat opposite her. "We were wondering, first of all, where you were during the time the bard was murdered... that would be around 2 a.m."_

_"Two?" Shamnur crinkles her brow. "I had gotten out of bed, since I wasn't as drained as I felt on the party floor. I rose, powdered my nose, and went about to see my husband."_

_Kyrel nods, and makes a note of that. "He was there when you arrived?"_

_"He had been up, I could tell you that. And, fully dressed, for that matter. But, he was there, when I arrived."_

_Kyrel says, "Fully dressed? He had shoes on?"_

_She pauses. "Now that you mention it... We were having a discussion about his closet. He didn't want me to go in, but I did anyways."_

_Kyrel says, "Any idea why not?"_

_Derleth walks around, seemingly murming some orisons to his goddess, and supposedly not paying any attention to what is going on._

_Derleth stops a moment, as if to listen to someone._

_"My guess is, he had something to hide." She smiles slightly. "Despite his conversational personality, my husband is a very... private man." Her head inclines. "Pardon my forwardness, sir," She leans back, her head craining toward Derleth, "But might I ask why you're still questioning?"_

_Derleth goes back to muttering litanies, as if he didn't realize the question might be directed at him._

_Kyrel says, "We've been deputized for the duration, it appears. At least some of the Watch thinks we did a good job tracking down the Talonites."_

_Shamnur's gaze turns back to Kyrel, a nod. "Ah. I wasn't sure; I was under the assumption you had been let off your duties, when you left earlier. My mistake."_

_Derleth abruptly stops again, and smiles benignly at Lady Foxmantle. "Excuse me a moment..."_

_"Of course."_

_Derleth exits promptly._

_Kyrel nods. "And we were actually at the party, too... So. Did you hear anything from the garden, then? Or see anyone heading that way when you got up?"_

_Outside of the room, Derleth recieves another tug on his arm. The steps are a little more prominant, leading down the hall. "You're **not** casting a spell are you?"_

_Derleth drops his facade. "No, actually, I wasn't. Why?"_

_Elucreh's voice sounds releaved. "Never good to cast a spell infront of someone you're questioning. They get nervous, defensive, and suspicious."_

_Shamnur considers. "I can't say I heard seen or heard anything odd, on my way to my husband's room, sir."_

_Derleth smiles slyly. "Which is why I'm laying down a pattern of behavior. If they expect I always wander around, murmuring religious dogma, then they won't look to closely when I **am** casting a spell."_

_"Still. If you're about to cast a spell, leave the room first. Like...say, now."_

_Derleth tsks. "That's silly. I can't ask Lliara for the power to discern lies if I can't see the subject, nor hear the questions that are being lied about."_

_Kyrel nods. "All right. Thank you for your time, Lady Foxmantle. We'll let you know if we need anything more from you."_

_She rises to nod. "I'm pleased to know I could help you."_

_"Besides, boots wern't the only thing I found in his closet."_

_Derleth decides to wait outside for Kyrel....seeing as coming abck in would serve no purpose._

_Kyrel steps out a few minutes later. "She doesn't seem to know anything useful... no surprise, really. What did you come out here to confer about?"_

_Derleth smiles. "He's just worried about me casting spells..."_

_Kyrel says, "Ah. Well, shall we go beard Lord Fox in his den?"_

_Derleth chuckles. "Interesting choice of words."_

_Derleth looks at Elucreh. "What was that about boots you were just saying?"_

_There's a pause. "Oh. I'm invisible. Yes, well, I found a little... 'spiced' pipe weed."_

_Derleth's brow wrinkles. "As in...what? More illegal substances?"_

_"Yes. Very mild, but not common to this area. Not addictive. Though, why the fool didn't keep it in his study... I havn't a clue."_

_Derleth says, "Meaning it could have been planted."_

_"He didn't want her in that closet, for some reason."_

_Kyrel says, "I wonder if there are any other secret passages in this building..."_

_Kyrel chuckles at a thought. "Considering how fond the Lord and Lady are of each other, he might have had a mistress in the closet that night."_

_Derleth and Kyrel seem to catch the same thing in their perepheral; a shadow that spawned from the doorway into Shamnur's parlor ease back inside.._

_Derleth looks at the others, and then mouthes, 'Maybe we should move on.'_

_Kyrel nods. "We should..."_

_The three slip down the halls to Thorvald's study._

_Kyrel knocks on the door. "Lord Foxmantle? May we have a word with you?"_

_"Absolutely! Come on in."_

_Kyrel opens the door and steps into the study, being careful to let it stay open long enough to allow the invisible Watch officer to enter. "The Watch gave us permission to continue asking around, if it's not too much trouble."_

_"Oh," He says, sitting up straighter at his desk. "Ah...well, then. Good. I have to apologize... that you've been roped into this."_

_Derleth starts his act of wandering and muttering litanies again. _Besides, Kyrel is the one who knows Lord Foxmantle best anyway...he doesn't know me from Azoun.__

_He gives Derleth a look, as the priest begins his idle mantras, before looking back to Kyrel, as if for explination._

_Derleth catches Kyrel's eye, and winks._

_Kyrel says, "Well, apparently they figured that we'd done a decent job with the Talonites, so we might as well keep looking at this. Besides, we were at the party ourselves." He chuckles at Foxmantle's look toward Derleth. "Oh, don't worry about him. He claims that that helps him spot scrying. Don't need anyone looking over our shoulders, after all."_

_Kyrel says, "We're just trying to get statements from everyone awake at the time of the murder. Turns out it was about 2 a.m... were you still awake at that point?"_

_Thorvald relaxes slightly, but not by much, nodding his head. He makes a gesture of warding belonging to a deity. "All this magic rampant in the world. Not good... No offense, of course," He opts, as an after thought._

_"Yes, I was." He says, evenly._

_Kyrel shrugs. "The Art can be used for good or ill, just like any skill." He nods. "Where were you at that time?"_

_Derleth puts as much space between himself and Lord Foxmantle...and then starts to cast a spell to detect lies somewhere behind him._

_"I was getting ready for bed." He states... before nodding his head._

_Kyrel says, "In your rooms?"_

_"Relatively..."_

_Kyrel just raises an eyebrow. "Nearby, then? Did you hear anything unusual?"_

_Thorvald nods to the first question, before chuckling. "Well, my wife showed up."_

_Kyrel joins the laughter. "I take it she doesn't often do that?"_

_A shake of his head. "No... But recently, we've been trying to reconcile our marriage."_

_Kyrel nods. "Well, I hope it works out for you. She did mention seeing something in your closet, and I forgot to ask her what it was. Was there something odd in there?"_

_Thorvald tips his head, looking to Derleth, then Kyrel, before shaking his head at something. He blinks, at Kyrel. "No, can't think of what there could be."_

_Kyrel makes a note on his pad, in response to a whispered question. "Crucial questions? Like what?"_

_When Thorvald looks away, Derleth shakes his head at Kyrel. 'Lie', he mouthes._

_Kyrel says, "Do you have any idea why someone would have wanted to kill Zaranda?"_

_Kyrel nods ever so slightly to his partner._

_The lord blinks, after a moment. "Well... she did slap Baron Mycroft. The man is a little irrational, I've heard." Shaking his head, "I'm glad Anya didn't see interest in him."_

_Kyrel murmurs, "No, she didn't..." He waits for an indication from the cleric._

_Derleth looks apologetic. The spell doesn't detect evasion._

_Kyrel shrugs. "Were you aware of your daughter's friendship with the bard?"_

_He blinks. "My daughter? Yes, I was aware."_

_Kyrel says, "Did you approve?"_

_"Somewhat... It could get her into trouble, and rumors could start. And, I don't want my daughter getting hurt... What does this have to do with Zaranda's murder?"_

_Kyrel says, "Just a possible motive. Some fathers would object to their daughter befriending a vagabond bard."_

_He nods. "Well I am. Concerned, for that matter. She could be getting mixed up with scullduggery. Or, with unsavory men; you and I know how men are. I don't want my daughter to end up so._
