Derleth mouths to Kyrel, so he's aware, 'spell ended'

Kyrel sighs. "Well, some men, at least. The question still remains, was Zandara killed here to embarass you, or did someone here wish her ill?"

Thorvald blinks, at Kyrel. "To... Embarress me?"

Derleth walks back around to the Lord's front, stopping his muttering, and fills his pipe again, preparing another smoke.

Kyrel says, "It can't be pleasant to have an invasion of the Watch, after all. And some folk are bound to suspect you were involved, even if you weren't. How long has your family owned this house?"

The lord's attention flicks to Derleth, especially as he fills his pipe, but eyes are snagged back by Kyrel. "Why, I'd say... Four, five generations. The family fortune was founded by Perkival Foxmantle, and has been in Selegaunt since."

Derleth fixes Lord Foxmantle with a steely glare as he lights his pipe, taking ominous puffs as his eyes fleck between the two talkers. _If spells won't work, maybe some indirect intimidation will..._

Kyrel says, "Are there any secret ways into the gardens that you are aware of? Any passages that people could use to get from one part of the house to another, unseen?"

His brows crease. "Now that you mention it... There may very well be... But I've never actually thought to look. Although, if there were, Shamnur would be delighted to know."

Kyrel raises an eyebrow. "Why her, in particular?"

A soft sigh. "For the same reason my wife keeps her quarters downstairs. She... is dreadfully afraid of a house fire. She was in one, when she was a child; it claimed her mother's life. So, anything that would help her get out of the house the quickest, it would releave her a little."

Kyrel shrugs. "I've rarely run across a secret passageway that was quicker to get through than the main halls..."

He spreads his hands. "Yes, but if she had it comissioned, then I would've atleast heard about it. She generally tells me, when there is business transaction of her intentions." His eyes shift to the glowering Derleth. "What breed of pipeweed is that?"

Derleth smiles curtly. "It's a brand I got while I was up north, at Tarlbren. Why?"

He aahs. "Actually, I've recieved a little of that. It's not popular here, but I hear further south, it's quite liked. Just curious; I have some Cormyrian Dusk, if you'd be interested."

Derleth shakes his head. "After living there for many months, I've gotten used to it...." He suddenly leans forward. "Have you many business enemies, Lord?"

At that, Thorvald sits back, and considers. "Business enemies? No, not incidently. However... there are some historical enemies..."

Kyrel says, "Historical?"

Derleth presses on, insistently. "And would they benefit, from laying a scandal such as this on your doorstep? Especially if the trail leads to someone in this very house?"

Thorvald eyes Derleth, "Well... Obviously, scandal, social wounds, gossip, settled scores, one-upping them, or opening up old wounds." He nods to Kyrel. "Yes... Bad blood between us and another house, infact."

Kyrel says, "Were any of them invited to the party that night?"

"No." He shakes his head. "The Uskevrens would not have shown."

Kyrel purses his lips. "They're not likely to be at fault, then, unless they managed to suborn someone who was invited..."

Thorvald nods. "Perhaps... But, I doubt they would go so far as to do this." He sighs. "Do you have any leads on who the killer is?"

Kyrel says, "A few ideas, so far, but nothing solid. We're still trying to eliminate possibilities."

Lord Foxmantle nods. "Of course..."

Derleth says, "You have nothing further to add? No clues as to who would have done this, or why?"

"It surprised me, to hear about it." Thorvald shakes his head, "I can't think of anyone, immediately, who would have done such. It's just... sad."

Kyrel nods. "We'll probably need to talk to you again, milord, but I think that is it for now. Derleth, do you have any more questions at the moment?" He's writing 'Anything else, Elucreh?' on his notepad, holding it up somewhat to be easily visible.

Kyrel's other hand is close enough, and holding his quill still. His hand moves, to it's own accord, writing down, 'Spiced Pipeweed'.

Derleth appears to have a thought. "You know, actually..it's funny you mentioned pipeweed...some was recently found in your closet. Spiced pipeweed." It's not really a question, but his glower demands some sort of response.

The pudgy lord's eyes slightly bug at the statement, before he stammers. "You did? Well...of course...I... Yes, yes, there was some in there."

Derleth smiles nastily. "Care to comment on how you got it? It's really not the sort o thing that law-abiding citzens should have."

Kyrel says, "Well, technically not us... it was the Watch who mentioned it."

"Well, I'd...er, ah..." He takes a breath. "I had it brought in, of course. I enjoy a little of it, after a stressfull evening. I planned on getting somethign to eat, last night, smoking a little, lay down, and...enjoy, before I fell asleep."

Kyrel says, "Where did you get it?"

"I had a caravan man descreetly purchase it off a grower, out of town, on his way to Selegaunt. There are some halflings who grow it, about two miles southeast of here."

Derleth smiles seemingly understandingly. "So it's jsut some for your own personal use...there's nothing in your mind about...including it as a regular product of your caravan, to those who desire it."

Kyrel shrugs. "Even if he did, it's not in Selegaunt's jurisdiction. As long as he doesn't ship it in to sell here...."

He's sweating, just a tad bit. "I... had a shipment of some illegal substances, when I first took reigns of the business from my father. I was stupid, then. I would never do it, now."

Derleth smiles benignly. "I'm glad to hear it...there might be those - the local underworld, for example, that might take that sort of undercutting of their business the wrong way...might even, say, kill someone in your household, as a warning."

Derleth says, "And if there was any possibility of that happening...why, you'd tell us, wouldn't you?"

Thorvald eyes Derleth. "Well, if that was the case, then I would stop selling. It's not worth the scrimpy gold, to endanger my family."

Derleth offers nothing but sincerity. "Glad to hear it...I think that's all I had to ask..."

Lord Foxmantle looks positively releaved. "Good..."

After having questioned the rest of the staff, Elucreh meeting with Banyan, and Rosalie having went out on the town. After several hours, the group simply collaborates at the Halfway Inn, over an as usual exquisit meal of roasted beef.

Rosalie smiles at Silniya. "It's been a productive afternoon, hasn't it. Do you think the gentlemen would prefer to meet upstairs?"

Kyrel nods. "I think we should, yes. Private discussion, no extra ears needed..."

"Seems reasonable. We pay for magical protection for a reason."

Rosalie nods. "Your room, gentlemen, or a private parlour? I'm sure supper could be served in either."

Kyrel nods again. "Let me tell the waitress, and we'll have dinner in our rooms. Safest, I think."

Orders having been placed, Elucreh arrives just as the waitress slips out of the bedroom door, ensuring small tables will be brought up with the food. "Ah. Sorry I was late."

Kyrel says, "We were just getting started. Have you had dinner yet?"

"No, actually. I was planning on dining here, as planned." He smiles a little rueflly, before taking a seat in an unclaimed chair.

Elucreh leans forward. "So, gentlemen, ladies. Anything having come forthwith?"

Kyrel fills the ladies in on what they've been told. "Lady Fox has a man on the side, apparently, and Lord Fox isn't admitting to financial troubles, though he had to admit to bringing drugs in when we told him they'd found them..."

Derleth says, "The only question is, is he lying about the possibility of selling them. He did get very nervous."

Rosalie leans backwards, toying with a goblet of wine. "We've been busy, too ... we've spent time in every hole twixt here and the walls, it feels like. But we have learned a little ..."

Derleth absently sidles close to Silniya, taking her hand in his. "Tell on, then..."

Kyrel says, "That's good to hear. We're not sure whether it's Lady Fox, Lord Fox, or someone else at this point...."

Rosalie grins at Silniya for a moment. "We've found Zaranda's main haunt, the Wide Realms. And it's difficult to understand how she made the kind of money that would support her habit. I'm sure it comes as no surprise to anyone present that dream mist is expensive ... And then there's Larcen."

Kyrel says, "Larcen? Who's that?"

Silniya idly claims Derleth's hand as hers, nodding to Rose, letting the other woman speak for the both of them.

Rosalie sips slowly. "Larcen? Turns out he's the local dream mist merchant. Used to sell to aristos like our Lord Foxy, but someone's been cutting into his territory. Although nobody seems to know whom. And then there's the Elf-Breath Hole. That sounded intriguing, but they're closed till sundown."

Kyrel raises both eyebrows at that. "So Lord Fox has been sniffing more than just spiced weed, eh?"

Elucreh's lips purse. "Ah, yes. I think I've heard of that. Every time we find a new little din of thieves and illegal sales, a new one pops up. We just havn't found this one yet."

Rosalie looks thoughtful. "He might have. We couldn't confirm. exactly, that our foxy lord was a client. Although he certainly fit the profile ..."

Kyrel grins at the Watchman. "If there's a demand for the stuff, it's going to be hard to stop it. There's too much money available."

"Mmhm," Elucreh replies, "And, it's quite addictive. And, doubles as a poison, to boot."

Derleth says, "What did he mean by 'cutting in to his territory'? Is he just saying they are undercutting his prices, or that he's being muscled?"

Rosalie turns to look at Elucreh. "We've held out on exploring the Elven Halitosis, considering their hours. Perhaps that's a good place to go next? And Derleth? The impression I got involved definite muscling in ..."

Derleth nods, thoughtfully. "Maybe one of our responses should be to muscle back, and see what that stirs up, then."

Rosalie turns to look more intently at Derleth. "You're planning to set up as a rival merchant?"

Elucreh's brows rise. "So... you plan on posing as a seller, and going into this Hole to strike a deal with Larcen?"

Derleth says, "Possible, but nothing necessarily so bold. I'm simply talking about shaking this group down. If we make things hard enough for them, maybe they'll tell us what we want to know, just to get us to stop."

Kyrel hmms. "Could be dangerous. Do we want assassins after us again? I'd just as soon investigate quietly. See what happens if we talk to the folks one on one. Do they have wares other than dream mist? I don't want to have to get near that stuff..."

Derleth sighs. "You have a point, Kyrel. I'm just...not as good at subtle as I'd like to be."

Rosalie sighs. "Wouldn't it be easier, Derleth, to pose as purchasers?" She leans back languidly, one hand held to her forehead in a pose, the other dangling at her side. "After all, here I am, but new to town, and my precious supplies have wholly ... dried up." She sits back up, grinning.

Kyrel says, "I'm sure Rosalie could give you lessons..."

Silniya nods, while tugging Derleth's hand, grinning lightly. "No, you're not." Her head inclines, towards Rose. "But, that begs the question: who would go with you? Not all of us can act that well, but do you intend on going in alone?

Kyrel says, "Depends on how long we'd have to be in there. I can cover us so we wouldn't be recognized for a few hours..."

Derleth blushes at Sil, and considers her words to Rose. "If it's just protection she needs, it could be any one of us...we've the ability to disguise ourselves, after all."

Rosalie hmmmms. "Derleth and Kyrel, and you, too, Silniya, are too easily recognizable, unless you could ... stay hidden. After all, these people **will** be suspicious."

Elucreh nods. "Yes, but, five going in at once? Three, perhaps, but five sounds conspicious."

Derleth says, "We don't have to talk...and I do have non-magical disguises at my disposal."

"As do I," The watchman puts in.

Rosalie turns to look at Elucreh. "Five would be, but a lady such as myself, and I do believe I have just the outfit, would never travel without a servant and a bodyguard. And perhaps ... if the lady would consent, I could adopt a hound as a pet?"

Silniya snorts. "Hound, yes. Forest wolf? Why would you bring a wolf to purchase drugs."

Derleth says, "Maybe, as a wolf, you would be protector as well."

Kyrel grins at the werewolf. "A very dangerous hound, but a hound, milady wolf. A little fur dye....?"

Rosalie tilts her head sideways. "But lady, I'm an aristo. I don't have to justify myself to the likes of these ... And as Kyrel points out, a little dye ..."

Silniya considers. The watchman tips his head. "Are you making it four, or five, Rosalie?"

Rosalie turns to look at the watchman. "I ... don't know, sir. As a watch man, if they recognize you, they will certainly know what's happening. On the other hand, if they recognize these men as our heroes, I can always claim to have hired them."

"Right. I know the lower rungs of this city, and many of them know my face. So, I don't think it'd be wise I go in, under obvious scurtiny. However, loitering around the establishment, as perhaps a knave who's had a tad too much wine?"

++Editor: Scrutiny, rather.

Kyrel says, "Always good to have backup... this would work."

Rosalie looks thoughtful. "Although given the spread of your ... idiosyncrasies, lady, perhaps you would consent to be disguised as my maid? They might be more likely to be suspicious of a wolf than a maidservant ..."

Derleth chews on his lip. "I'm not sure all of us should go anyway..we should not, as the saying goes, put all our eggs in one basket. At most, it should probably be myself, Sil and Rose...at least, Sil and Rose. While the remainder of us explore other possibilities, such as Laris, or scrying, or lurking about the manor."

Kyrel nods. "Better to lurk under a magical disguise, too. Let's do it that way... if something goes bad, we'll be close enough to help bail you out."

Silniya chuckles. "Your maid accompaning you to somewhere like that?" She clucks her tongue. "Well, I wouldn't be able to immediately get my weapons, if I'm in a more four legged form."

Her smile is almost feral. "But, on the other hand, I don't need them."

Derleth smiles and paws affectionately at Sil. "You are a weapon, on four legs or two."

Rosalie sips her wine again, savouring the bouquet. "At the very least, to keep this role going, I should have a bodyguard with me." She looks thoughtful, pondering the wine for a few moments. "Perhaps we should use a magical glamour. With a disguise underneath? Let them find the one, and they'll not seek out the other ..."

Elucreh tips his head. "There's another concern."

Derleth says, "Oh? Do tell."

Rosalie nods at Elucreh. "Yes; do please elucidate."

"If they have the means to detect a magical guise, then through the same method, they can detect any other magics on you. Your weapons, your items. Now, surely a bodyguard and lady would have some, but they would not be armed to the teeth, with sorcery, so to speak."

Kyrel says, "A point... we could wait outside, though, with the rest of the gear. Armor and a weapon for the bodyguard would pass..."

Rosalie sips her wine again, thoughtfully. "So I would be going in ... near naked. I would naturally not be wearing any armour; what aristo does? Perhaps, though, I can keep my gloves. Tucked in my belt pouch they wouldn't be immediately obviously. And who can be surprised by a magical ring or two?"

There's a knock on the door.

Derleth calls back, "Who is it?"

"Dinner?"

Derleth looks at the others. "Figure that's safe enough..." He puts a hand on his flail going to open the door, though...

The halflings, armed with plates and tables and platters.

Derleth relaxes. "Enter, sirs, we welcome your borne food with open arms."

The halflings enter, and begin setting up the tables, before distributing the food. Elucreh glances towards Rosalie. "Your gloves, madam?"

Rosalie smiles at Elucreh, but waits for the halflings to leave before she answers. "Yes, sir. My gloves. A most handy and kindly gift from my dear mother, but somewhat inappropriate to the outfit, being made of a reasonably plain though high quality leather. Perhaps, sir mage, you could make them appear to be more than they are?" She pulls a glove out of her beltpouch and tugs it on carefully. Snapping her fingers, she is suddenly left holding a loaded shortbow. Moments later, the shortbow disappears again.

Derleth was about to start into the food, and then gapes at Rosalie. "Urm...impressive trick."

The watchman grins, slightly. "That could be useful, in my line of work aswell."

Kyrel says, "Indeed. I'm sure I could come up with something to pretty them up..."

Rosalie smiles, raising one eyebrow. "So ... near naked but not, I think, entirely so?" She pulls the glove off again, and stores it carefully, before piling some of the food onto her own plate.

Derleth looks at the others. "Should we really keep Elucreh and Ky tied up as backup? I still think they should seek answers elsewhere...and having them lurking around, they might be spotted easier than we are."

Kyrel says, "If we're spotted, there's nothing to connect us to you... and if you're spotted, you'll need backup. Backup is never wasted time. Besides, we can watch who else enters the place. Possibly including our friend Foxmantle?"

Elucreh raises a hand. "A question. Rosalie, did you find out where, or what this place is set up in?"

Derleth scoffs. "After the way we made him sweat, I doubt he'd go himself...still I suppose you are right. I am to headstrong, more often than not."

Rosalie nods at Elucreh. "Aye; a warehouse near the docks. Directions weren't as hard to find as they could have been, and the warnings were as plentiful as the directions."

"Right," The detective says, with a nod. "Now, my concern is this: If there is a problem that arises inside, how will those outside know? Furthermore, how will they get in?"

Rosalie grins widely. "Oh ... you'll know. It will be hard to miss."

Derleth absently wonders what Rosalie means by that, and looks at her questionignly.

Kiri cheeps, as if to get the human's attention. Kyrel smiles. "My co-conspirator...."

"I would think an invisible bat would be a tad bit conspicious." Elucreh glances to Rosalie. "That is, if you're trying for full discretion. And, that doesn't answer my second question."

Derleth says, "Kiri has been quite effective in the past...but getting in might be a problem, unless Ky just fireballs the roof off, which I doubt he can."

Silniya glances about. "This means I'm going to have to wear a leash, doesn't it?"

Kyrel says, "Who says he has to be invisible? He's small enough to fit in someone's pocket."

Derleth grins slyly at Silniya. "Can't blame me. I won't be the one holding it."

Rosalie looks apologetically at Silniya. "I'm afraid so, lady. Although I'm sure we could use a quick release knot."

"No need. Just don't grip it very hard. You let go, I'm free." She smiles.

Rosalie nods at Silniya. "Still ... with a quick release knot, we could drop both ends and it wouldn't tangle."

Elucreh glances to Kyrel. "You couldn't spell us in there, could you?"

Elucreh nods. "So, I take it you and I will stand outside, and hope no squermishes happen within."

Kyrel says, "If Kiri's in there? I'll know which way they went, and any doors in the way aren't a problem..."

Rosalie finishes the last of her wine. "I think, gentlemen, that we're beginning to plan beyond the scope of our knowledge. So, shall we finish this splendid food and then pursue our plans?"

Rosalie says, ""Is working on her desc, Hix. Gimme sec. :)"

Three hours later, they emerge. Derleth, twice disguised. Silniya, leashed and collared in an easy slipknot, taking her own natural four legged look... with dyed fur, appropriately.

_Rosalie shines in a long black tunic, over thin black leggings. Both are decorated lavishly with silver trim, which is repeated in both the Her silver hair is held back, exposing her long pointy ears, and gathered again in the middle of her back in a twist of black silk. Silver tints her eyelids, and small silver studs nestle in her ear lobes. headband gathering her hair, and the gloves covering her hands._

They all head down to the docks, and pause several blocks from a delapidated warehouse. Elucreh suggests that he and Kyrel stop here, and after the three head inside, to slowly drift toward the warehouse.

Kyrel nods, disguising himself as a beggar with a change self spell, and activating the spell on Rosalie's gloves. Kiri hides with Derleth, ready to hide under his cloak if the spell needs to be dropped.

Derleth absently strokes Sil's head while he can. On the outside, with his granted spell, he looks tall, handsome, and dangerous...underneath, he looks short, ugly, and dangerous, thanks to his disguise kit.

Rosalie, Silniya and Derleth head toward the warehouse. A drunkard is eyeing them, at the corner of the warehouse. There's a nondescript door with a sliding panel in it, on the side of the warehouse.

Rosalie turns to Derleth, one eyebrow raised haughtily as she waves at the door. "Knock, good man. Knock. You know I need to speak to these people."

Derleth grunts. "Yes, Mistress." He raps on the door with his gauntleted hand.

As accorded, the panel slides open. Relative darkness, despite the darker silluette of a face. "Yuh?"

Rosalie twiddles with her leash. "Well? Ask the man to let us in. Do I have to think of everything? Oh, and mention breathing into the gap. I'm famished."

Derleth looks back at the face. "Me mistress wishes to be let it. Ur...breathing into the gap?"

The silluette stares at Derleth.

Derleth's brow creases. "Breathing into the gap, man. Are you deaf?"

Rosalie taps one foot, impatiently, on the ground. "Oh, for crying out loud. Try breathing on him. Maybe the garlic'll wake him.

Derleth looks at Rosalie confusedly, and seemingly tries just that.

"I don't have to hear you, man." Though, as Derleth breathes into the slat, it shuts, and the door unbolts, swinging open. At first glance, it's dark inside.

Derleth looks back at Rose. "Best let me go first, Milady..."

Rosalie pouts. "Oh, by all means. Just don't take too long."

The dark figure at the door calls out, "What's with the dog?" At that, Silniya snorts.

Derleth glares at the face. "Me mistress's loyal pet. Ye have a problem wi' that?"

Derleth puts a hand on his flail, as he strides forward into the darkness.

"The bitch better be trained." Derleth isn't met with any resistance. At glancing around, he'd notice immediately some light, coming from around a corner.

Derleth calls back, "Come ahead, milady. I have your fore."

Rosalie smirks, patting her hound on the head, before striding confidently through the door.

Derleth moves towards the light, once he sees Rosalie follows.

The dark figure shuts the door. It's almost completely dark, but the 'guide' leads Derleth along. Rounding a corner, there's a stairwell down.

Derleth moves cautiously down the stairs, posing a distrust of all he sees, but moving forward anyway, keeping an eye back at his 'mistress'.

Rosalie follows blithely behind, leash held loosely in her hand, a smirk pasted on her face.

The stairwell ends in an open room. Three men are playing a game of dice, looking up. In old chairs, on mats, or piles of blankets, are humans, and even a halfling, in various states of conciousness. One is openly smoking a pipe, the fumes quite colorful, and smelling definetly wretched. Another is licking some substance off of her hands, while looking around in a relative daze.

Rosalie looks around disdainfully, nose held high. "The things one suffers, with clumsy servants."

Derleth wrinkles his nose, and looks about to see if there seems to be some man or woman in charge of these drug-addled folks.

Silniya sneezes. The men playing dice look up, before one stands, nodding to the 'guide', who heads back up the stairs. While the other two dice players look on, hands drifting to their waists, one approaches. "How can I helps ya?"

Derleth steps forward. "Me mistress...desires to make a purchase." he grunts.

Rosalie tugs absently on her glove. "Well, good man? Do you sell?"

"Ah hah... yeah. Right." The speaker turns, and heads out of the room. The two dice players seem attent on the new arrivals, waiting atleast a moment. Then, the speaker returns, at his heels a man obviously in charge. Well dressed, compared to the rest of the squaller and tough, hair maniqured and oiled, and definetly smiling. His eyes flick down to Silniya, then surveys Derleth, and Rose, while opting, "You're looking for... a purchase, lady?"

Derleth does not answer yet, since he was not the one addressed.

Rosalie turns to Derleth, raising one eyebrow, then turns. "Welladay, in this day and age. Yes, good man. We seek to make a simple purchase. We were told to find a man called, my maid assures me, Larcen?

"He can be found here, yes," The well dressed knave replies. "And, what is it you're looking to purchase, paticularly?"

Derleth steps forward. "Milady desires the stuff called dream mist, sirrah."

The knave's eyes don't peal off of Rosalie's face. "Dream mist? Is that so. Well then, lady, right this way." He turns, and draws through the doorway, a glance to ensure that the three are following, and to the men who're still playing dice.

Rosalie waits for Derleth to precede her, before confidently striding forward once more.

Derleth strides before Rosalie, as his role as her protector, still airing an attitude that expects ambush....

"So, what brings a lady such as yourself to this little place? It shows a great deal of class, to do something yourself, instead of sending your husband, or your man on the leash to retrieve such for you." The three are lead down a short hallway, past a few nondescript doors. A man and woman, situated on a bench along the hall, seeming half fully alert, have their eyes and faces a little more preoccupied with eachother, then to look up. The leading man opens up a doorway, and steps inside. The first thing that comes to mind is the temprature: it's humid. The cause: in the center of the room is a pot of boiling water, a small fire built under it. Otherwise, the room is well furnished, actually housing a couch, and some nice chairs. "Please, make yourself as comfortable as possible, lady...?"

Rosalie nods, seating herself fastidiously on the chair furthest from the pot of boiling water.

Derleth again speaks up, his lips curling into a sneer. "Milady chooses not to give her name...and she would not have come, had she not wanted to acertain the quality of the product, after the...accident, that robbed her of her supply."

"Mmhm." He smiles, at that. "Your lady wants to sample the product, then."

Derleth does not answer directly. "Do you have it, or don't you? Milady's time is not to be wasted. If you do not have what we require, we will go elsewhere." he snorts.'

His brows brood a storm. "I'm the only seller in town, except for hacks. And, the prices in the Realms are much steeper then mine. But, if you will excuse me..." He then slips out of the room, closing the door.

Rosalie turns to Derleth, and beckons him close. "Ask him if he is, indeed, Larcen," she whispers just loud enough to carry to the spectators. "The Foxy Lord recommended him and only him."

Derleth grunts disdainfullyas the man leaves. At Rosalie's commans, he nods, and replies, "I will do so...but I wish you had not a'come, milady. This places reeks of an ill wind." HIs voice is slightly louder than hers.

Rosalie shrugs one shoulder, dismissively. "I'm here now, and I'm sure these people will not harm one such as myself. That would be ... foolish."

The door opens, the seller followed by a burly half-orc, who's wabbling, while carrying a chest. The half orc, smelling of wine, lumbers over to the corner, dropping the chest down gently, and leaning against the wall. The seller starts towards the chest, before a third man, one of the dice players, comes to the door. "Uh..." The seller turns. "What? I'm with a customer." "There's some folks wanting Resin salve. So, we need a cutter, two bands, a filter, two bands, and some finger laces."

++Editor: Two bands only need mention once.

He adds, "And a cover."

Derleth strides forward, ignoring whatever they are saying. "This be it, Sirrah Larson?" he inquires of the well-dressed seller.

Kyrel has been giving Elucreh a running commentary, mumbling as if to himself to stay in character. He blinks at the latest turn. "What's resin salve?"

Elucreh blinks at the half-elf. "I have no idea."

Kyrel hmms. "Whatever it is, they're selling it down there."

"Then, go shake the cossies, they'll know where it is." The dice player nods, and skips off. Turning, "That's Larcen. I like to think I'm good enough they named the act after me." Nodding to the half orc, who opens the chest, Larcen walks over, and rifles through. Rising, "Now, I have something specially made for people of your... social elite." Walking over, he bares two things: a small bottle, and a snuff box. Setting the bottle aside, he opens the snuff box, which appears empty. "Common snuff box." Reaching inside, his finger carresses the bottom, and he opens up a little door in the bottom, baring a small compartment, filled with a whitish blue powder. "Perfect for a lady who prefers to keep her habits under supposed others, hm? Snuff is the rage, even if it doesn't offer the same dreams."

Elucreh shakes his head. "Kyrel, I don't think so. I'm pretty familiar with almost all the narcotics that come into this city, and I've never heard of Resin salve."

Rosalie raises one eyebrow at Derleth, and gestures him forward.

Kyrel shrugs. "Didn't say it was a narcotic, but they're selling it in there. That's what Kiri heard them say..."

Derleth steps forward, moving to take the box, if allowed, to study it.

Derleth figures that it's...relatively nothing he's seen before. Larcen eyes the approaching Derleth. "What? It's the product." Shutting the compartment and snuff box, he takes up the bottle. "Now, the Dream Mist in the box is the same quality as that in this bottle. This is simply a sample batch, so you get a full dose of it." He glances to Rosalie. "Now, would you like to dream?"

Rosalie raises her eyebrow again. "Here, my good man? I should think not. This ... is not the place for a lady to dream."

Kyrel mutters, "Now comes the tricky part... will they take 'later' for an answer?"

"Hm hm. I really don't see how you're going to sample it, but all right. You're just looking to purchase, then. Do you simply want it, or the snuff box aswell?"

Derleth gives Larcen a suspicious glare. "I protect my lady, dispute it not." He considers. "We will test this sample elsewhere, and once she is satisfied, we will arrange to have the rest delivered."

Rosalie waves her hand languidly at Larcen. "Have him deliver it, man. Enough of these go-betweens. I grow weary of all this."

Derleth looks at Rosalie, and then back at Larcen. "Milady has spoken." he rumbles.

"All right... Well, then," He returns to the chest, and retrieves a vial. Uncorking bottle and vial, he taps a very tiny amount into the vial. Capping the bottle, "Someone will deliver. Of course, I'd need an address, and the gold." He hands the vial over. "I'll assume the lady knows how to properly take it."

Derleth glowers. "Milady does. But she did not ask for 'soneone', she asked for **you**. But put that aside for a moment...she has questions."

"Then, she has no business."

Rosalie raises an eyebrow. "Then Zaranda spoke false when she said Larcen dealt with such as myself?"

"And you're taking the word of a dead woman, so be careful." He pockets the vial, while replacing the bottle in the chest. Which the half orc sits on, as it's closed. Larcen walks over to the couch, to relax upon. "And, I really don't care who you are, I don't deliver myself."

Rosalie looks surprised. "A dead woman?"

Larcen nods. "Mmhm. Word travels fast."

Derleth puts a hand on his flail. "I hope that d'nae be a threat on my lady's person..."

"Oh, no," He shakes his head. "Simply, a suggestion on who to take advice from. Those who've gotten themselves killed, or those who're alive to back their words up."

Rosalie says, "Just a day ago, at the revel, she spoke with me. She seemed hale and hearty then. What could have changed?"

His brows raise. "Revel? Which one would that be?"

Derleth does not speak further for the moment, merely looking about, assessing the others for an incoming attack, seemingly not being assured by Larcen's words.

Rosalie says, "The one that Lord Foxmantle hosted, naturally. She assured me, personally, that I would get only the finest from you, sir. But lackaday, not the finest service, I daresay."

Derleth keeps one eye on the half-orc.

"It doesn't help, when the Watch keeps peeping into your shop." His face seems a little sour. "Though, I'm surprised she gave my operations such a high critique."

Rosalie shrugs absentmindedly. "She mentioned the competition, sure. But you, apparently, have been in business a long time. And tgese newcomers haven't. I don't like to deal with short timers."

"That surprises me. Those newcomers are quite close to the source of your information."

Rosalie ohs, curiously?

Larcen smiles. "He goes by the name of Leris."

Derleth gets this feeling in his solarplexus like, _Whoops._

Rosalie says, "Leris? I'm sorry sir; I don't recognize the name."

Kyrel sits bolt upright. "Leris. Have your people find him. He's dealing the stuff, too. This changes things."

Derleth says, "Milady, I do. I saw a butler accosting him...but he seemed like nothing but a sneak thief!"

Rosalie snorts. "I don't deal with sneaks. Or thieves!"

Larcen's expression is almost predatory, and saturated with venom. "Leris. Works in the _Wide Realms_. His supplier gets him the stuff, and between the Theatre, his... exploits with, hmhm, lonely ladies of the upper crust, and his supplier's work, they have cut my sales of your people nearly fully." A chuckle. "Then, I'm glad you came here, lady. We here are not sneaks nor thieves."

Elucreh's brows arch. "Tell me, would you be needing to cross examin this place again? Because, I'm sure I can get word to the Watch and bust it, equally."

Rosalie chuckles. "I see. Well, perhaps we can do business after all. This Leris sounds quite ... unacceptable. But really, I can't be expected to return here. A lady has her reputation to consider. And hirelings can be so ... susceptible."

Kyrel says, "Hold off for now. Leris is Lady Foxmantle's riding partner, and that may be in more than one sense of the word... but he's supposed to be one of the dealers of the dream mist through the Wide Realms. Let's watch them for a while, and try to wrap them all up at once. This is a time for caution and planning. Have you ever heard the story of the young bull and the old bull....?"

Derleth nods. "The reason milady requested you, sirrah...we need someone reliable to deliver this merchandise."

"Indeed." Larcen tips his head. "Well, I'd certainly like to hear about Leris's remains found in an alley, but of course, the man has money protecting him. So, as soon as I get your address, and you have the money sent to me, you'll have your product delivered."

Rosalie says, "And who will deliver it?"

"I will, of course."

Rosalie says, "We will look forward to seeing you, sirrah. Now, my good man, if you'll pay for the sample? I am sure," she turns back to Larcen, "that a little caution will not offend?"

Kyrel says, "Most interesting... Larcen says that Leris has money protecting him. Implying that he's being backed by someone, and if Foxmantle's hurting for cash, then which of the other houses might it be?"

Derleth nods, looking to Larcen, making a motion as if to dip into a money pouch.

Larcen's smile is dazzling. "Lady, a little caution and full discretion is what this business is about." He glances toward Derleth. "Ten gold, my good man."

Elucreh nods his head. "Or, it's Foxmantle's own money that's protecting him."

Derleth hands it over without an argument, leaning forward as he does. "Sirrah," he murmurs. "ye've won a loyal customer, ye have."

Kyrel nods. "Possible, but there were indications that he was running out of money. Might be that he's trying to break into this market to recoup his losses, and Larcen doesn't realize that he's not doing so well, I suppose..."

Vial and gold exchange hands. "And, a loyal seller. Now, your address, so that I can deliver it?"

"The Halfway Inn, sirrah. I will be on hand to recieve the shipment, and pay ye in full."

Rosalie smiles benignly at Larcen. "Indeed, my good man. Indeed. And I can be found at the Halfway Inn. Any halfling there will recognize me."

A chuckle. "Of course." He nods to the half orc, who eases up, taking the chest with him, and walks out the door. He blurts out a few things, while heading down the hall.

With the vial in pocket, Derleth, Rose and Silniya head out, noting the two humans who were necking on the bench are gone. Rose spots a discarded crossbow bolt underneath the bench. The dice players are still at their game, the druggies still in place. No sign of those new entries. They're lead up the stairs, and released into the night.
