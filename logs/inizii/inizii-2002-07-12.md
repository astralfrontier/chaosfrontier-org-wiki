# Inizii 2002-07-12

Rosalie moves into the crevace, again checking for traps but still finding none. The room beyond is Dark. Rosalie's sight has trouble even piercing the gloom; it looks relatively safe, and no traps mark her way. The torch's light seems to be swallowed in emmense blackness; illumination pierces out so far, but then is held at bay. No sounds reach their ears, Silniya reporting no scents. Rose leads through the merk, at first not seeing any walls, but up ahead, there is a bend.

Rosalie pauses, waving the rest of the party forward. Her senses stretch to the limit: with the lack of adequate vision she relies on her hearing to warn her of any surprises ...

Derleth is nervous. Fighting evil...he does not fear this. So far, their obstacles entering the crypt have not been sentient...but what happens if they are?

Kiri, released from his cloak, flies about. He reports a little confusion; the room seems small, but big too. Something he can't quite explain. Rose waves them forward, and as she moves around the bend, she hears something. A soft gurgling; strained breath. A whimper. One thing is for certain, it's in pain.

Rosalie holds up a hand in warning, and then motions Derleth forward. The healer might know what that sound is.

Derleth perks and comes forward, looking at Rose inquiringly.

Derleth strains at hearing, but after a few seconds, he can tell. He's heard the sound of sound trying to move through a throat filled with blood. It sounds bad. Waning. Coming from up ahead, around the left turn.

Derleth frowns. "It's not good. Whatever it is has internal bleeding. They're choking on their own blood." He starts forward, instinctively, looking around the corner...

Rosalie waves the others forward, explaining quietly what's happening. Then she turns to Silniya. "We can watch his back." She notices Derleth move, and immediately steps forward, trying to position herself in front of him.

Kyrel follows along, trying to make sense of what Kiri is trying to tell him about the area they're moving through and alert to any ambush that might be waiting.

It's hard to see what's around the corner; it's just so damned dark. It's close, and even Rose has trouble seeing. Wait? Something very, very barely stirred ahead, from its' position on the floor. Though, from the look of its lack of speed or agility, it doesn't pose a threat.

Silniya frowns, muttering, "I smell blood."

Derleth stretches out a hand, murmuring an orison to Lliara. Soft light suddenly comes from above, a small ball of radiance conjured by priestly magic.

Rosalie moves forward, short bow at the ready, arrow nocked.

It does little better then the torch; the gloom is far from pierced. Rose moves forward, crouched, ready, and finds herself in a fork in the tunnel; three passages, one forward, one left, one right. In the center of the small room, is the body of a woman. Her cloths looking like priestly vestiges, an acolyte, perhaps? Blood pools around the sides of her form; from where Rose stands, she notes many puncture wounds covering the woman. She moves! Her head lifts, a little, before falling back. The gurgly breathing issuing again.

Rosalie leaves the woman to Derleth, and peers down each of the passages in turn, using both sight and hearing to try to cleave the darkness.

Derleth can barely make out the silluette, even with his glowing light above. But he can see part of her lower robes, which almost glow. Bright yellows, oranges, reds. The color of the Dawn, of the Dawnbringer's followers.

Rose gets nothing; the tunnels are even too gloomy for **her** to see into, and no sound prelevates.

Derleth strides forward. "Don't try to speak." he murmurs, a healing spell on his lips...

She lifts a single, crimson-stained hand to Derleth, a meek, begging look in her eyes, before laying her head back.

Derleth concentrates, his mouth forming supplications to Llaira, laying hands upon her that glow with holy power...

The positive energy flows inward, and instead of the wounds healing, the woman starts to simply change. Her robes become a bright light, while the body beneath seems to waste away ethearelly. The robe's color swirls once, before spreading out upon the floor, runes of the Common tongue forming. _Pure, Sharp, and Generous. Keep it up._ The colors seem to crawl across the floor, toward the center passage. As Rose and Derleth watch, the gloom crawls back, exposing the lack of any other passage but the center.

Derleth looks stunned. "What the..."

Kyrel nods. "And another test. This is becoming a pattern, I think."

Rosalie nods. "At least the pattern seems to be easy." She shrugs, bow still nocked, and looks down the centre passage. "Shall we move on?"

Silniya looks around, shaking her head. "Let's just hope whatever the tests are for, we get through them."

Derleth arches a brow, looking wry. "First Sessis, and now the crypt. It's a wonder I don't feel annoyed. "

Kyrel says, "Let's continue, then. We're not getting anywhere standing here."

Derleth chuckles wryly. "Oh, sure. We jsut witnessed a small miracle and you don't want me to enjoy it."

Rosalie waits for Derleth to finish enjoying his miracle. What better time to check, once more, for traps? And after that ... onwards.

The tunnel heads on; those colors are like a guide, even if the tunnel s still unnaturally dark. Rose checks for traps, but still nothing. Up ahead, she can spy a round room. The colors blaze straight to the center, where a circular plate is situated in the floor. The glow of those swirling motes illumates some of the room, which seems relatively barren.

Kyrel says, "It seems to want us to look there. Shall we?"

Derleth looks about. "Pretty. Rose, see if there's anything between us and the plate, first?"

Rosalie moves forward into the room, her gaze roving, searching out traps. They touch momentarily on the grate, then dismiss it as a distraction, and looks around.

Nothing. Not one that she can tell, yet.

The oranges, reds and yellows converge, rippling over the plate, before starting to wither upon it, seperating.

Derleth moves up to eye the plate then...Kyrel is the most in tune with the arcane...but this is a holy tomb...and that's his backyard.

Kyrel moves forward as the colors start to dwindle, and then realizes they're forming words. He look at them carefully, trying to read them before they vanish.

The closer everyone gets, the more they look like words. They are almost partially visible, but Sil hangs back, uneasy. Only when she comes forward, does the first sentence begin to become coherent.

_Behold the power Lathander hath wield_

Two more lines ripple down, as if to expect more. And then it starts. The whispers.

Unintelligent, unregisterable; the sounds of hissing, of sprites' taunts that are just too low, too high, too off for the ears to register. Kiri is getting extremely confused; he can't find out where they are coming from.

_Wave of Life wounds hath healed_

Derleth is uncertain...whatever minor intelligence that seems to goven the wards of this place would not seem to have it in for them...but he's not completely certain.

Louder. More pronounced. The shadows around the circle of light their torch holds seem to ripple, to contract, to tease at the edges and corners of vision. A whisp of white there. The silluette of something unworldy here...

_Power which unlife unpeeled._

Kyrel calls Kiri back to his shoulder, trying to comfort his familiar in the face of the magic.

Rosalie merely waits, weapon ready. This is beyond her ken ...

The voices' tones change from taunting to almost angry. Threatening. Silniya looks definetly unnerved, her weapons wielded. The runes begin to glow brighter.

Derleth bites his lip, his hand drifting to his flail...

Shapes of shaded menace form within the void moving about them. A half-registered tentacle weaves out, then back in. Some umbra paw excapes the murk, clawing upon the stone. Chill begins to premenate the room.

The runes grow brighter, but despite the continual shedding of light, the shadows are starting to close in more, torch and magic not making them yield.

Derleth pulls his flail from it's hangar, prepared to face whatever evil thing of shadow and dark the claw belongs to...and whatever else lurks in the black.

Rosalie unnocks her arrow, stowing arrow and bow back in the quiver, and hence in the haversack. This sounds like close order work ...

Eyes are beginning to peer at them, now the amorphous shapes more bold in their half lurching from the dark. Even if it continues in the constricting around them.

Rosalie looks around. "You know, Der, if casting a healing spell caused one miracle, perhaps trying to turn the undead would cause another?"

Kyrel says, "I would say it's a good idea whether or not there'd be a response."

The whispers are growing almost painful, flirting in the eardrums and minds of the group steadily being squeezed by the tightening ring of umbra.

Rosalie says, "Any time now, Derleth. Any time." Rosalie sounds only mildly impatient. And her teeth are barely showing.

Derleth looks dubtful. "It was never my strong suit, but..." He pulls his medallion free, boldy presenting it to the eyes. "In Lliara's name, I abjure thee. Flee her power, or become as dust...."

The runes blaze, before erupting to cover the circular plate in gleaming magelight. And then it begins to sink partially. Like a spirate, one segment goes down, then another deeper, until the plate has formed a tight, spiralling stairway downward. The whispers yield, the circle of light widens slowly to its natural place, as if some eclipse of their vision had finished its' cycle.

The smell of dust, musty air, and rot filters up from the hole in the floor.

Derleth breathes a sigh of relief. "I owe you something nice for that, Rose."

Rosalie grins. "Remember that bracelet we discussed?" She moves forward, gazing thoughtfully down the staircase.

Silniya relaxes somewhat, moving over to give Derleth's shoulder a hug. She wrinkles her nose. "Let's hope that isn't undead down there."

Kyrel says, "I begin to suspect that it's not a good idea to come in here without a good cleric..."

Derleth pats Sil's hand. "Well, as long as it's not Ebrek down there, I can always try to tell them to go away, again...but I bet it's just normal dead."

Kyrel says, "I think Ebrek would have a lot more trouble with us now."

Derleth shakes his head. "I bet Ebrek is more powerful, now." he comments. He leds the way then, his amulet in one hand, and his flail in the other.

No traps find themselves on the stone spiral. Heading downward, it's discovered after one circuit of the steps that the last of the plate's steps meets with a stairway just below. Torchlight pierces this room rather easily, to find the macabre sight inside: skeletons. Three of them, their cloths rotting or nothing but moldy, chewed tatters. One has a book in what was its' lap.

Rosalie moves into the room carefully. She shakes her head over the skeletons, and carefully shifts the book with her sword, trying to see if it's a spell book or a journal.

Derleth looks about. "This would seem to be the place...but there's nothing obvious, but a book. Where is the weapon Sessis fears, I wonder..."

Rosalie says, "Remind me again, Kyrel, weren't there three people entombed here? Do we know anything about them, other than that one was a Lathandrian priest?"

Derleth says, "One was a mage, I thought."

A drop of water falls on the tip of Rose's sword. The book looks like a good portion of it has been damaged by water; infact, one whole side. But the other, where the torso slumped over slightly, has protected it from the dripping through the ceiling. From the looks of it, it is a journal.

The room itself is not unfurnished. There are the remnants of supplies, of backpacks rotten or chewed through. However, this is not the tomb. One look to the north wall shows a stone archway, magical runes decorating its' surface. Beyond is further gloom.

Derleth points out the runes. "See if you can dechiper those, old boy?" he comments to Kyrel.

Kyrel nods. "I'm already on it." He's been gazing around the room, and the runes attracted his attention.

"... And we've finished. The tests for whoever may come for the... whatever it is Kanlis and Amrand left to guard are in place. If they are smart, and good enough, and hopefully powerful enough to handle what our leaders could not on their deathbeds. But now, we are trapped here. We cannot teleport out, and demons fill the upper halls; they have found the crypt. We lost Andle and Larinis to them."

"My comrads died today. From starvation, or maybe the damp air... I am starving..."

"I saw a rat. I tried to kill it, but it got away..."

The final entry is a goodbye, an acknowledgement that death is near. A fairwell.

Rosalie looks up from the journal, biting her lip. "Kyrel; have you ever heard of Kanlis and Amrand? This party was defeated by them ...."

Silniya's eyes bulge. "Of course!"

Derleth blinks and looks at Sil. "What is it?" he murmurs, distracted from watching Kyrel.

Kyrel says, "Same as before. Protection from evil. But this time, directed inward."

Silniya shakes her head. "I thought Kanlis and Starbolt, but it didn't ring, but Amrand... Yes. They were one of the lead bands who spearheaded into Hellgate Keep. They helped immensely in the battle with the leading fiends... And no one found them again."

Rosalie says, "I wonder ..." She stands up, and paces around the room, placing her hands on the walls in various places. "That doorway is so obvious ... would there be a secret door?"

After a complete tour of the room, she shakes her head. "Well, if there is one, it's better hidden than I know." She turns to Silniya. "What was Amrand like?"

Silniya shakes her head. "I knew some who had been in the fight... They had seen Amrand, who was gravely wounded, before they had to continue elsewhere, a little more pressed." She shakes her head. "He was a Lathanderian priest."

Derleth drums his fingers on his armor. "well, none of aare evil, so it probably poses no danger...I could just go in. And I bet all would be okay. Though, if you want, I do have a divination spell at my disposal..."

Rosalie nods. "So he could have set the first tests ... And Kanlis?"

Silniya cants her head. "These three sounded like they set up the tests. And there were more of them. So, I don't think the ones buried here set them up..."

Rosalie shrugs. "Maybe not." She looks at the portal. "One way into the room; one way out. Shall we?"

Kyrel says, "It's what we came for."

Derleth shrugs. "I'm not going to turn back now, in fear of the unknown."

Rosalie looks around the room one last time. "Could we say a prayer for these people, before we go? It's not a proper burial, but ..."

Silniya moves towards the opening. "Let's be about it then." She pauses at Rose's words, canting a glance to Derleth.

Derleth looks wry. "That's not fair, that you thought of it and I didn't..." But he goes right ahewad then, and murmurs the words of Lliara's last Rites over the bodies of the fallen, first.

The room isn't very well furnished. Three coffins, two propped up in the corners closest to the door, the other against the far wall. They are covered in dust and cobwebs. However, they don't seem to be the immediate eye-grabber. Standing upright on a pedistal covered in wards is what looks like the sword of a paladin. As the group steps into the room, a soft, warm glow radiates from it.

Rosalie narrows her eyes, holding up a hand. She begins to chant under her breath, looking for signs of magic. That protection spell on the portal was too unexpected.

Derleth immediately stops his advance, waiting to see what happens next.

The pedistal glows almost as brightly as the sword, to Rose's eyes.

Rosalie points out the glowing pedestal to the others, as she steps closer into the room. Then she turns to examine each of the coffins in turn.

Silniya looks around the room, before peering towards the Pedistal and the blade atop it. "Are we going to send it to Sessis through the magical little trinket she sent us, or are we going to take with us?"

_I wonder why they didn't take up the sword to defeat the demons. What was holding them back?_ She looks intently at the coffins, trying to find the test.

Kyrel says, "We're going to take it with us. With all the wards on this thing, I don't want to hand it over to someone we're not sure of."

The coffins do glow. The two in the corners have wards, for keeping them sealed, protected from intrusion, and to keep them resilient against the test of time. The one in the corner has fewer, but still looks pretty sealed. There may be something inside them.

Rose also spies some glowing from cracks within the walls. Something... else?

Silniya nods, pursing her lips. "All right. Then who gets it?"

Derleth looks at Sil. "We're going to take it with us. If we send it to her, we won't be able to get it back. We may be sticking around to deal with the Blight monster...but I will not lay my life down in servitude to her." he growls.

Rosalie says, "Do we even know the sword is the true weapon, Kyrel?" She points at the wall. "There's a glow here, behind the cracks ..."

Derleth looks over the pedestal, trying to see if there are any words or runes.

One word Derleth thinks he sees. _Beware._

Kyrel is looking around, having cast the same cantrip himself. "I'm not sure what the weapon's form actually was. I'm not sure we want to go breaking into coffins, though."

Derleth hrms. "The pedestal says Beware."

Rose checks the wall, and discovers that the stone blocks holding it up aren't sealed. Pushing in some of the stones, or pulling them out, would open a hole.

Kyrel says, "No kidding."

Derleth says, "Wait...no one do nothing...I'm going to do a Divination...this is too important to do the wrong thing."

Rosalie takes a deep breath. "Good advice, Derleth. I've found a secret door; let me check for traps, and then I'll try to open it ..."

Derleth starts getting out the things he needs...

Rosalie grins, looking back. "Or I can wait ..." She moves to stand between Derleth and the sword, ready to intervene should it become animate ...

Silniya looks around. "Rose, they havn't set any traps thus far... I have the feeling they wanted to get people like us In here, not kill them after getting them here..."

Rosalie smiles at Silniya. "Well enough; but better to look and not find, than to failt to look, and end up finding the traps the hard way ... The few minutes it takes, are minutes I would rather spend."

Kyrel says, "Besides, you wouldn't want her to get into bad habits... the next tomb might not be so nice."

A smile from Silniya. "True, true."

Derleth lets inscence burn and mutters prayers of power crosslegged, setting a jade figurine before him as an offering to his goddess...finally, after several moment, he mutters his question. "Where does the sword we seek lie in this place?...."

Derleth opens his mind to his goddess, and a rushing surge of something fills him. He feels as though he is flying, or falling, or something; the presence of Her is with him, no doubt. The sounds of clinking coins, rolled dice, of fortune honestly turning fills his ears. Amid the din does his answer come, forming itself in the chimes. _What you seek, beware it; what you feel, fear it. Before you, it is; uprised, upheld._

Derleth blinks, befuzzled, and repeats the words of his lady to the others. "Beware what we seek...could this item be cursed?"

Kyrel says, "Well, it's certainly warded. It's definitely the sword."

Rosalie looks thoughtful. "Can you detect evil, Derleth?" She turns to the wall, and ponders the secret door again, tempted to open it.

Silniya eyes the sword, herself. "Why would there be so much warning over something that looks so holy?"

Derleth shakes his head. "I do not know. But it makes me wonder that, since my god has spoken directly to me regarding it, it is not something that affects only evil."

In response to Rose's request, he does indeed chant the orison to make the darkness of evil to be visible to his eyes...

The sword is nearly blinding in the radiation of something so Vile it can only be evil. Not unholy, but Wrong, lurking beneath the surface of this deceptive item. Derleth even get's a glimpse of something; as if the sword wasn't a sword, but a Scythe.

Derleth flinches back. "Lady Bright...the sword is not holy at all..."

Silniya frowns, stepping back from it.

Kyrel says, "Ah-hah. Not that it needs to be to destroy a Blight. That's something even beyond evil."

Derleth shakes his head. "I never even considered that notion...that the item might have a dark nature."

Rosalie says, "Because it's too obvious, Silniya? Every other occasion was a test. Perhaps this is, too." She turns to the secret door, shifting the blocks to open the hole. "Can you sense evil here, Derleth?"

The blade's aura of light seems to sicken, until it's an angry radiance of hate.

Derleth blinks, and gladly turns his gaze from the foul blade, looking at where Rose points instead.

Derleth says, "But, I don't think this is a test, Rose...the divination said what we sought was before us, upheld. That would have to be the sword."

Nothing gleams of taint from the hole Rosalie makes. However, her magical sight dances inside; whatever's in there has enchantments.

Silniya glances towards Kyrel. "Maybe the sword has some defense of it's own; why it looks so blessed. Maybe a dispel would peel away its' disguise?"

Rosalie smiles at Derleth. "Well, yes. But ... " She looks in the hole, checking once more for traps, idly noting that some traps are less obvious than others.

Derleth looks at the others. "I should take it. I can't weild it anyway...and if something happens, I likely won't be able to hurt any of you with it. We can't leave it here anyway. Someone will try for it again. And they might succeed."

Rosalie says, "Wait, Derleth. Don't touch the sword yet. There's something in here. Something magical; or at least enchanted multiple times."

Derleth nods. "I'm not eager to." he says wryly.

Rosalie, after peering into the darkness, sees a little cache of items. Infact, quite a few! A staff that gleams, a quiver for arrows, and a longsword. But the thing that glows the most is a glove.

More items are also in there, but it would appear that they are the last remains of what was left, sentimental items like jewelry.

Rosalie pulls out each of the items in turn, examining them carefully, and then laying them on the ground. Last, she pulls out the glove, comparing it's glow with the glow on the gloves she wears herself ...

The glove has runes sown into the very fabric. Rather then leather, it is durable cloth. The school of magic being adjuration.

Derleth scratches his chin. "You know, maybe we should consider something else. Maybe we should bring it to Brightwater to find out how it can be destroyed. Sessis might actually endorse that idea. This could be an evil artifact."

Derleth says, "In fact, I'm starting to think this thing might be sentient."

Silniya frowns, and considers the potential. "Or something else. Maybe there's something like an evil soul in there, or something?"

Derleth nods. "Yes, that is my thought. There is an abiding hate, in the sword."

The ranger looks back to Derleth. "Whatever the case, you're not touching it."

Derleth says, "We should have seen it all along. The crypt was built not to prevent a good sword from being used against evil. That's illogical. It was built to prevent an evil sword being used against good."

Rosalie says, "Kyrel?" She gestures at the items. "What do you make of these?" She holds up the glove. "Could this protect us from the sword?"

Kyrel looks curiously at the glove that Rosalie has found. "Adjuration magic. And a lot of it. I suspect so, yes. It's certainly worth a try."

Rosalie peels one of her gloves off. _Who needs a smoke stick at a time like this, anyways?_ After carefully putting it in her haversack, she slides the newfound glove onto her hand.

It fits. Rather well, infact. She feels rather comfortable, Rose's skin crawling in a good sensation.

Kyrel inspects the runes. "Aye. Protection from Evil again, and directed toward whatever you're holding. I'll bet that's it."

Silniya nods to Derleth, staring at the sword, which now has glyphs rippling up its' blade like striking snakes.

Rosalie looks at the glove carefully, and then realizes she's wearing it on the wrong hand to wield a sword. She chuckles, quickly peeling off both gloves, and switching them around. "Derleth, Kyrel, if I go insane, or evil, please kill me quickly and cleanly." She moves towards the sword, ready to lift it.

Kyrel says, "If we have to. That's why I've got a Remove Curse spell."

Rosalie nods, and takes the final step, placing her hand on the sword.

Derleth is holding his breath and doesn't realize it...

Light and darkness erupt around Rose's hand, the two radiances warring. A soft glow pulses up the sword, before it begins to change in Rose's hand, like some mask is being cracked across the weapon's surface. Within her hand is a scythe that could only be a tool of malevolence: the haft is onyx, carved in runes that bubble and seeth with an inner fire. A human thighbone seems incased in solid iron at the top, from this a serrated blade extends, some vile liquid bubbling along the barbs, but held at bay by some benign shield. At the center of the haft is a large, fist sized bloodstone, each piece of the haft socketed into it. Scarlet light burns in its' depth, almost trying to lash out, but contained. Whatever's in there is mad.

Rosalie gulps, looking at what she's got in her hand, careful not to touch the weapon with any other part of her body. As a first experiment, she tries to put the weapon back down ...

Derleth holds his hands up protectively, letting his detection spell fall...he cannot bear to look on that in all its menacing majesty.

She lays it atop the pedestal, where arcane tendrils dance up its' surface, much to the gem's apparent anger. Wards twist and churn in a sea upon the blade, forming words in common now. Threats. Horrible threats, promising pain and death, if it is not released. The hair on the back of Silniya's neck has raised.

Rosalie takes a step back, letting the weapon lie where it lies, for now. "And I'm sure none of us want to touch it ..." She winces, feeling somehow besmirched. "I think, gentlemen, that this is your cue to figure out how to destroy it; I certainly fear what I felt, and feel about it ..."

Derleth shakes his head. "Maybe we should take some time to rest, here. I would have to re petition for a divination spell in the morning...and that's likely the only way we'd find out unless Kyrel has something in his bag of tricks."

The runes on the blade continue to surge, the secretions along the blade forming them, having no where to go, trapped in the protective membraine of the spell. _Destroy me, and the Abyss **Shall Rain** upon you._

Rosalie nods. "I will keep watch tonight. I've little enough need for sleep ... And a weapon like that should never be left untended."

Derleth snorts. "Oh, go whine to Cyric."

Kyrel says, "Well, whatever it is, it's making threats. I'm not inclined to believe it, though."

Derleth taps his chin. "Actually, the god of Tyranny would be more appropriate...since he also encompasses hate..."

_You will be first, Lliarian._

Derleth can't help but shiver a little. "Now I think I know why it wasn't destroyed before."

Kyrel says, "I think another divination is a good idea, though. Could this thing be _causing_ the Blight?"

Rosalie smiles at Derleth. "Sleep; let it threaten you in the morning, when you've petitioned your goddess."

If words could be accented to convey emotions, these runes would offer the most aciddic contempt. _This is the reason I hunt mortals._

Derleth shrugs at Kyrel. "It could be." He ignores the blade.

Rosalie pats the weapon on the handle, for lack of a head. "Yes, yes, we know. Whine whine, humans are evil, humans are vile, you want to kill us all. Why don't you take a nap?"

Derleth can't help it. He laughs.

Silniya glances sidelong at Rosalie. "Um... Not to be the wet blanket, but whatever that is, I don't think its' wise to taunt it."

Kyrel says, "Technically, I think its problem is that humans _aren't_ vile, but I'll vote with Silniya."

Rosalie smiles at Silniya, and shrugs. "Sorry; it just reminded me of one of my brothers. He whined in exactly the same sulky tone of voice when he was grounded, too ..." She settles into a comfortable stance in front of the scythe, one hand over the other, glove held firmly in place. "Will you stay in the rope trick, Kyrel?"

Silniya ponders the scythe a moment. "I will watch it when you need some rest, Rose." A glance at Derleth, as if to convey she'd prefer he'd be up with her.

Rosalie shakes her head at Silniya. "I can forego sleep for one night; I need but little as it is." She holds up the glove. "And the fewer hands that wear this, the happier I'll be. Keep them safe?"

Derleth catches it immediately. "Maybe we should have two person watches...I'll wait up with Sil..."

\*\*\*\*\*\*Switch last two poses.

Silniya smiles at Derleth, before nodding solemnly at Rose. "Right..."

The night, atleast the night to them - time is not so tellable in this tomb - passes without incident. The glyphs have went from speaking to simply churning, Rose with little else but to ponder. This... thing before her. The actions she took with the drider, tooth and claw to its' flesh. After too much time with her thoughts, the others awaken, spells become prepared.

Kyrel gets his books out when he wakes, and spends a little time renewing the ones he used the day before. "Anything happen, Rosalie?"

Rosalie shakes her head at Kyrel. "The scythe's been quiet. I wonder what it's name is ..."

+++Edit: Place the following before Ky and Rose's pose.

As Kyrel and Derleth are still preparing, Silniya moves over to Rosalie, after all have awakened. She settles beside the rogue. After a few moments, "You feel unnerved about what you did to the Drider, don't you?"

Rosalie nods at Silniya. "Yes. I don't ... usually bite people. Or enemies. I didn't expect to ... to lose control."

Silniya reaches out, patting Rose's thigh. She nods, simply. "It happens." A glance towards Derleth, who is praying. "I had to become more comfortable with myself... I got bloodthirsty in a fight, when we were surrounded. I had always been comfortable, but then when I joined with them, I tried to be a little more... too human." She glances back to Rose. "It takes... accepting it as a part. Don't fight it, just ease into it."

Rosalie chuckles wryly. "If my mother could hear you now ... she was always warning me about my temper. It's too easy to forget how weak others are, and too easy to hurt them. And that drider tasted **so** awful ..."

Silniya shares the chuckle. "Yeah... It's like anger. You bottle up the part of you that wants to be wild... and it gets out, and it comes out raging. You have to let it out, now and then, let it out to play, and accept it. Then it will be a little more behaved. Because you'll know how to deal with it. But don't let it rule your life, either." That last sentence, Silniya looks away, her words much more somber and almost pained then the soft words before.

Rosalie grins. "I will, Sil. And thanks. Of all of us, I think you can understand the best." She looks down, petting the glove absentmindedly. "It was ... unexpected; their lack of response." She nods her head at the others. "I'm glad you found Mr Bones, even if he wasn't the corpse I'm looking for ..."

A smile. The werewoman sighs. "It's good to have someone to relate to, too. As for Mr. Bones... we just stumbled upon him. I hope you do find your father."

Rosalie smiles toothily, her eyes distant. "Oh, I will. I will ... I have some ... " She pauses, licking her lips, her pointy teeth especially obvious ... " I have some _messages_ for him ..."

Silniya smirks. "I guess he owes you some answers." A glance at the scythe. "So you plan on wearing the glove with that thing, eh?"

Rosalie nods at Silniya. "At all times. At **all** times."

Derleth goes through his things...and he looks at the others. "Anyone have any semiprescious stones? I'm running low...I suppose I could use this Amethyst necklace as an offering, but it would be helpful if someone else had something...the more potent stones should be used for more potent spells..."

Rosalie nods, and digs through her pack. "I have the one gem I picked up on our last stop." She holds out a deep blue gem. "It's only a spinel; will the goddess accept it?"

Derleth eyes the stone. "It should do just fine." He murmurs in agreement.

Derleth takes another look at the gem. "You know...you should keep that. I'll use the necklace. This is actually very valuable. Not that I'm trying to cheat the Lady. I've been using stones that are worth for more than the spell requires."

Rosalie nods, accepting the gem back and carefully stowing it in a side pocket of her haversack, after mumbling something under her breath.

After discussing what specific question to ask, Derleth sets up the divination once more...laying out the amethyst necklace as an offering. The pungent smell of burning herbs fill the room as the short priest invokes the power of his goddess...and then he intones the question. "What should we do with the scythe?"

The familiar feeling comes to Derleth, but this time, it feels a little different. Almost omnimous and offering warning. _Fortune shall find you a way, but wary the exposure to tool most foul. Evil's prison, cage of a death. Do not keep it. Careful._

Silniya waits on the sideline, anxious.

Derleth looks worried as he repeats the words to the others. "I can only assume that the 'do not keep it' means for the long term. And we shouldn't try and use it, or expose ourselves to it, as much as possible. Because the first part implies that perhaps Lliara has an idea of what to do."

Kyrel mutters, "If she isn't just trusting to luck..."

Derleth looks at the others. "If it weren't for the Blight, I'd suggest taking it to Brightwater straight away. In Lliara's keeping, it's as good as destroyed...unless someone wants to lay seige to a Greater Power's home."

Derleth looks sternly at Kyrel. "The Lady's Luck never fails. It's just not always direct."

Silniya nods, before casting a glance over her shoulder at the Scythe. Who doesn't seem very happy about the situation at hand.

Rosalie looks at the scythe, and then pulls out her quiver, measuring to see if the scythe would fit inside ...

Kyrel says, "Ayup. It's too big for the Bag, even if I wanted to risk it."

Shaking her head, Rosalie sighs. "Nope. That won't work either. We can wrap it up in a blanket, I suppose ..." She eyes the other magical items lying on the floor. "Will we leave these behind? They, too, might be useful."

Silniya glances back. "Then, what do we do with it once we're out of here?"

Rosalie looks over at Kyrel. "That rope trick ... that makes a room achored by a rope. Does the room move if you tug on the rope?"

Sil purses her lips. "It'd be grave robbing, one way or another."

Derleth taps his chin. "We'd just have to wrap the blade...anyone know leather working, here? We could make a sheath for the blade."

Kyrel says, "Hah. I wouldn't trust that thing to stay in a scabbard if we weren't watching it like hawks. I suspect we're stuck with using the glove and carrying it."

Rosalie shakes her head. "I'm better with stone." She turns to look at Silniya. "Perhaps ... but we're taking the glove. And these were not stored inside the coffins. Perhaps they would not mind?"

Derleth sighs. "Well...maybe we should cast invisibility on the one carrying it? Otherwise, we're going to be e big ass targets."

Derleth says, "The only other solution...is that I go to Brightwater alone."

"I don't know," Silniya replies. "Then again, we've picked equipment off the dead before..." Her eyes snap to Derleth.

Rosalie looks at the scythe, lying on the pedestal. "A pity we can't polymorph it. Or shape a stone scabbard ..."

Derleth looks solemnly at Sil. "Obviously, the Blight threat is paramount, Sil. I'm not arguing that with you. But everyone and his uncle wants this scythe. The drow, the Fey'ari...the Blight casters would probably love this too. We'd be safer with Shandril Shessair, the Spellfire wielder, in our party."

Derleth says, "If I leave alone, and take the scythe to Brightwater, you can take on the Blight."

Kyrel says, "Invisibility, then? Or seal it in rock?"

_Mortals, I care not about your silly Blight!_

Rosalie peers at the scythe. "So tell me then; what care you about?"

_I care about being freed. I care about squeezing the lifeblood out of the quartet of you. I care about getting back to Hellgate Keep._ the pedestial almost rocks, with the pulses of scarlet surging within the bloodstone.

Kyrel says, "Hmm. Looks like it's actually telling the truth. Who'd have expected that?"

Rosalie ahs. "Well, thank you. It is always good to know the goals of one's traveling companions." She turns to Derleth. "Sorry; nobody is carrying this one by themselves. Too dangerous."

Derleth chuckles. "I think the thing is too elemental to tell lies. It's a bundle of hate."

The words upon the scythe are mockingly sarcastic. _The same could be said about you. Too base to be anything more then breeding stock and chum for the amusement of my Bretheren._

Derleth nods to Rose. "Okay, that's probably true."

Rosalie ignores the scythe, smiling as its insults once more mimick those of her younger brother. A brat she often had to discipline.

Derleth taps his fingers. "Okay...Rose, you're carrying it. We cast invisiblity on you. That means you **can't** get into combat." That lasts for about an hour...lnog enough for us to get out. Once we get out, we figure out what to do next.

Silniya stands up. "Why don't we all go invisible? That way they won't see us coming."

Derleth looks at Kyrel. "Do you have three spells? I have one."

Rosalie nods, lifting up the scythe. "I will not enter combat until the first of you falls."

Kyrel says, "Just two."

Rosalie pulls her cloak from her haversack, while she waits for the magic users to parcel up the magic. A little back up never hurts.

Silniya walks towards the stairs. "But first, let's save the spells until we start up the second flight of stairs. We're protected until then, and every moment of the spells' duration is precious."

Kyrel nods. "Agreed. Let's hope we can even carry the thing out past the wards."

Derleth grunts. "I hadn't even thought about that...well..give it a shot."

Rosalie follows Silniya. For once, she walks in the middle of the group, rather than taking point.

The four move up the stairway, and out into the Outer Sanctum. They head back the way they came, which is much less gloomy then before. They open the Quartz door, to find an odd greeting waiting for them. Standing on the stairs, just beyond the wards, is a figure. The torchlight plays on the dark fur gripping its' head, having the likeness of jackal. It is dressed in rather smart, professional attire: a well cut black tunic, a vest over this, and leggings. "Greetings."

Rosalie blends into the shadows, using her every ability to become as non-obtrusive as possible ...

Derleth doesn't pull his flail. But a powerful offensive spell does come to mind. "Who are you, and what is your intention?"

A dextrous finger is lifted. "Ah ah. I see you there."

The jackal headed one nods simply. "You might call me Enithril. My intent is to discuss the well-being of my client, who happens to be in your pocession."

Kyrel says, "Client?"

Enithril nods his head. "Quite."

Derleth sighs. "Beshaba's bosom. The scythe has a lawyer."

Enithril chuckles. "Not quite so much the scythe, but the person trapped inside."

Rosalie looks at the scythe, under her cloak, attempting to gauge its reaction ...

Oddly enough, it isn't giving one. Perhaps it reasons silence is best, here.

Derleth folds his arms and eyes the man. "So...what...you want us to give the scythe to you? or you want to free the being in the scythe? or you want to sue us for unlawful posession of a spirit trapped in a weapon?"

He grins. "You possess a demon. I know the irony is delicious, but that's not the point. You see, my employer is willing to make a deal, for my client's freedom."

Derleth tilts his head. "Your employer being?"

"A very influential balor." He smiles toothily, and all the while comes off smooth. "We are willing to offer not only your safety from my client, but also information which may aid you in seeking out the Defilers."

Enithril adds, while lifting a finger, "And protection from any associates of my client, who he might procure. This protection carries over to loved ones, also."

Derleth looks at the others. "Suddenly, a third option is open to us." he looks back at the jackal. "I don't suppose you want to share the balor's reasons?"

Kyrel says, "Or for that matter, what exactly your client _is_?"

A benign smile. "You see, you have a very powerful assassin there, in your pocket. His skills are rather useful, especially at the moment; we're still dealing with some conflicts with Infernal influences."

Derleth raps on his armor. "Clearly, he seems to be of great value for you be offering such a good deal."

Enithril makes a dismissive gesture. "You want to get the fiend off your hands, we want him back. It's a win win situation, wouldn't you say?"

Kyrel says, rather dryly, "Somehow, the idea that he might get loose doesn't enthrall me."

Rosalie nudges Derleth in the back, trying to get his attention. When he turns, she motions at his holy symbol. _What about Liara's message_ she whispers.

Derleth smiles coldly. "Sure, if we want to turn a blind eye to exactly who he'd kill after we free him. Of course, you say it's for internal politics...which implies, other demons...but who's to say it will remain that way?"

The jackal headed lawyer looks crossly at Kyrel. "Would you prefer to go into the Abyss, set him free yourself, and then kill him? Because that's what it will take. Good luck." A glance back to Derleth. "Infernal is Baatezu, actually. I am unfortunately not responsible for any unfortunate deaths that may be delivered by my client. I can only rest assure to you that you will feel no reprecussions from his releasel."

Rosalie looks thoughtful. "How large is this circle of loved ones? What of one, such as Silniya, who loves all the Great Forests ... Will each of them be safe from repercussions?"

Derleth strokes his chin. "Let me ask this, 'Nith, old boy. What would your employer do if we said no? Would he try and get the assassin back by non-legal avenues?"

A sigh. "Now you're getting into loop holes. Immediate family and friends. But, I assure you, my employer has no plans to reinstate another Hellgate keep. Aweful busienss, that was." Enithril smiles at Derleth sweetly. "Well, if you don't agree, then my employer isn't bound by legal obligation, is he? No deal would have been made."

Derleth shrugs at Rose, at her whisper. In his mind, this could also be luck providing an avenue.

Derleth sighs. "That's lawyer talk for, 'he'd try and stomp us flat'." he explains to the others.

Silniya nods, before crossing her arms. "Exactly what is your client doing in the scythe to begin with?"

Enithril shakes his head sadly. "Well, you see, during the few final confrintations of Hellgate Keep, my client ended up getting imprisoned by three very powerful individuals. However, he had wounded them with a spesific type of method which could only be healed while on consecrated land. The archmage of the little enterige had a limited teleport, which he used to come here, set up some defensive wards, sent for who he could in a limited message, and died. His comrads were less under their own power."

Enithril raises a finger once more. "Allow me to offer one more consolidation. I have went to the liberty of rounding up your horses for the purposes of procurement and protection until you arrived to take them onto your hands. I can have them, and you, wisked to a place of your choice on this plane. Thus, you do not have to deal with the inhabitance of the tunnels you sealed off."

Rosalie says, "Enithril: how quickly must we decide?"

His fingers steeple. "My dear, I have an eternity. You do not. And, might I remind you of those Defilers ravaging your Forest. Which, if you agree, I also remind we can offer information regarding the location of said defilers."

Kyrel smiles. "Ah. _Now_ we're getting somewhere."

Derleth bites his lip. _This is starting to sound like a pretty good deal...and also a pretty lousy way of muscling us. Course, it'n not like they're holding people hostage. But I'd hate for Platinum to die at some fiend's hands if we refused._

Rosalie says, "Perhaps we can talk to you again in, say, 12 hours, Enithril? A decision like this should not be made lightly ...."

Enithril flicks his wrist, a scroll unfurling. "No loop holes, hidden clauses, or sneaky small print. I was trained in the fourth level of hell: we procure our deals and souls with the utmost scrutinty and trust. Not like those on the Fifth level, who chase newly dead souls." He makes a simple nod to Rosalie. "Whenever you are ready. I'll simply measure the hour by each withering tree. Call my name when you are ready."

Derleth glares at Enithril. "your humor is staggering. We'll get back to you."

He clucks his tongue, pointing at Derleth. "See you when I do." He turns around, walking up the stairway.

Silniya spits on the floor. "And I thought human law-writs were slimey."

Kyrel says, "They are. This is an archetype."

Derleth turns and looks at the others. "well...contrary to what it seems, we do have options. We can't keep it. Clearly. So either we give it to them and take their payment...or I give up Platinum...and we go straight to Brightwater. The balor won't be able to threaten Lliara so easy. That means we have to put the Blight on hold, though."

Silniya glances to Derleth. "But, if a fiend is trapped in it, it can't be killed but on its' home plane, right? So all taking it to Brightwater would do would be a safe deposit box."

Kyrel says, "Hmm. Fortune will provide a way. You think she doesn't object to this?"

Derleth shakes his head. "I don't know. it is a possibility.Maybe she **doesn't** want to have to protect it from the Balor. And you have to remember...she's not Tyr or Torm. Maybe she sees freeing the demon as the best thing to do under the circumstances."

Silniya sighs. "We made a deal with the Rakshasa before. And we seem to be getting the better end of the deal here. Not to mention it will help us find the Defilers."

Derleth sighs. "Why do I pine for Ebrek? At least that was simpler."

Kyrel says, "That's the key. We thought this would do it, but if so it's quite indirect. I think we might as well, if we can get the appropriate safeguards."

+++Edit: Put that before Derleth's comment.
