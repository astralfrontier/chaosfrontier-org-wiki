After leaving the Wide Realms, Silniya and Kyrel head back to the Halfway Inn, while Elucreh had a prior appointment needing seeing. A little waiting, before Derleth and Rosalie return from their shop-hopping.

Rosalie makes her entrance in grande dame style, Derleth carrying the requisite packages behind her. "Silniya, darling! Have we found **just** the dress for you!"

Kyrel looks relieved as they get back, apparently none the worse for wear. "Have a good day, did you? Anything interesting turn up while you were playing the parts?"

Silniya, deciding to play along, raises from her chair. "Rosalie, Love! That's just **lovely!** C'mon, lady, sit, sit! Let's have you here. And, you too boy," She wiggles fingers at Derleth.

Derleth flushes slightly at the mention of it, setting the packages aside. "I think Rosalie enjoyed it more than I..."

Derleth smiles shyly at Silniya, and comes to her side. "So...have fun bouncing Leris off the floor?"

Rosalie winks at Silniya, "The question of Derleth's blushes, darling, we should I think leave to you. Rest assured, I picked out some outfits that made him look quite plummy. Poor man. I'm sure you'll enjoy modeling them."

Derleth asides to Kyrel, "I think she gets a kick out of embarassing me...."

Silniya chuckles heartily. "Good, then. I'm sure he was mimicing a red dragon to a T, while you were being the elven silk that you are." She collapses gracefully into her chair, turning to Derleth. "Alas, I would've loved to, but we were civil..."

Rosalie leans back to address Kyrel. "Zaranda doesn't - or rather, didn't - stint on her clothing. And she did purchase traveling clothing recently. Not all of it her size."

Kyrel says, "Indeed..."

Derleth blinks, glancing at Kyrel. "Ky, really. He's a criminal, of more than one sort. I know you like to be urbane and gentlemanly, but that tactic won't always work."

Kyrel says, "Leris was also in the center of all his friends and colleagues. Bouncing him would have been... iffy. We can always do it some evening. He seemed to imply that it was another theatre person who killed her."

Kyrel says, "And we glimpsed a very interesting stagehand. A Chitine."

Rosalie raises an eyebrow. "Professional jealousy? Or hired?"

IniziiGM taps her fingers, trying to remember something... then shakes her head, inable to remember.

Derleth hmmphs. "That sort of tesement is suspect, at best. If he's in tight with the theatre crowd, why would he betray one of them? Unless he wants them out of the way for one reason or another...." He nods at Rosalie. "Very possible, yes."

Kyrel says, "He didn't say. I'm not sure I believe him, either. I think we'll have to keep an eye on him."

Kyrel says, "Oh, and we were invited to see tomorrow's performance by our old friend, the Mill."

Rosalie grins at Derleth, and raises her chin. "I do believe, Derleth, that it is time we explored the relative quality of the local dramatic talents. Do you not agree?" Her voice has acquired a certain haughty quality, and she grins when she finishes.

Silniya watches with bemusement. "If it's all the same to you two, I'm watching from a seat."

Derleth grimaces. "I was looking forward to getting this makeup off...I don't really care for looking this homely, even under a Change Self Spell...besides, I can't cast it again today..."

Kyrel says, "Opening night is tomorrow, Derleth. You can go back to normal for now."

Silniya considers a moment. "Kyrel, Leris also mentioned something else."

Kyrel looks up. "Did I miss something? Not surprising..."

Derleth phews. "Thank god." He gets out his diguise kit, and starts in on getting various removers out, and gets a basin of water, scrubbing at his face.

"Really. When he was getting pissy with you, he called Lord Foxmantle a fool. But, after that, said Shamnur'd like to get rid of him."

Kyrel nods. "Ah, that. That's more corroboration than anything. Of course she'd tell her paramour that. Might even be true."

"I think, gentlemen, m'lady, that I am beginning to lose track of all the clues we have. There seem to be so many; at first I was convinced the father was the culprit, and yet now Leris suggests the theatre. Perhaps if we could recap the pointers we've uncovered?" Rosalie sighs, shoulders dropping down again. "I feel so sorry for Lady Anya."

Kyrel nods. "Aye. She's the only innocent in this whole mess, it seems."

Derleth snorts. "The way things are going, lets hope she stays that way."

Silniya leans forward. "Okay, we have a body, strangled by a rope, that was found burned in Lord Fox's locked study. We have a footprint that was deeper then it should have been."

Rosalie nods at Silniya. "We have rope, and a secret passage, and bad credit. And a connection to dream mist. Which reminds me, Derleth, how do we verify that the sample we have is good?"

Derleth fishes the Dream mist out of his pocket. "is that really important? We don't care if it's good, we just want Larcen."

Kyrel says, "Find an alchemist, I'd say. Maybe the Watch has one on staff."

Derleth looks at it with a grimace. "I personally wouldn't care to touch the stuff."

Rosalie looks thoughtful. "How likely is Larcen to sell us cut rate drugs, merely to test us?"

"But, we know an alchemist," Silniya parts. "That tailor?"

Kyrel looks thoughtful. "Now that's an interesting idea. We might want to talk to him anyway. See what he knows about things since we got rid of the Talonites."

Derleth says, "Hmm. Yes, the gnome might be willing to help. But why would Larcen test us by giving us inferior Mist? What would be the point?"

Kyrel says, "The point would be to tell if he could pawn inferior goods off on milady Elf. Is she really a conisseur, or just a dilettante poser?"

Derleth chuckles. "Would it matter if she was? It's still all profit. Hell, if he pawns off inferior stuff, he makes **more** of a profit."

Silniya puts her hands on the table. "But, why manipulate him? And, why would he give inferior stuff, if he was trying to break back into the aristocracy?"

Kyrel says, "True. Unless he suspects her of being with the Watch, in which case it may be completely fake."

Rosalie smiles toothily at Derleth. "In the underworld, your word is your only bond. And if he offers cut drugs, we gain a useful lever to ... manipulate him. As to the rest, who knows? but why use up a source unnecessarily?"

Derleth groans. "Stop it...after the Talonites, I was hoping to stop being so paranoid..."

"Still, even more informative then Larcen, Leris is a better well." Silniya leans forward. "Think, where is he getting his supply from? Obviously, not from Larcen's source."

Kyrel nods. "I'd like to backtrack him. Kiri could watch him for a bit, I think."

Rosalie grins at Derleth. "Indeed. In any case ... do we still believe the father was responsible? Everything seems just a little too simple. Especially if we discover, next, that the old fool was an avid theatre lover."

Kyrel says, "I'm still thinking Lady Foxmantle did it. And is perhaps trying to frame her husband."

Derleth scratches his chin. "I had another thought while we were out shopping...Ky, did you procure a spell to scry others during the last month?"

Kyrel nods. "I've had it for some time. Clairvoyance. Don't have one on tap right now, but I can have one tomorrow."

"What confuses me, Kyrel, is her motive." Rosalie looks around, hoping for inspiration. "We know why her father wanted Anya to be single and unattached, but the lady had a second source of income from Leris. Assuming she was the one introducing him to his clients."

Derleth shakes his head. "I mean the one that others have been using on us...the one that doesn't have a distance factor, and uses a mirror."

Kyrel says, "Ah, that one. No, I haven't."

Derleth nods. "In that case, I'd like to go out and purchase a font from my temple...Scrying was one prayer I learned after the Talonite episode, but I need a font to cast it. I was thinking we'd use that pipe we picked up as a focus."

Silniya looks over to Derleth. "Why not use a font At the temple?"

Derleth says, "I suppose I could...but having my own small font would be beneficial, for future purposes. And I have the gold to spend."

Kyrel says, "It would be a bit of a nuisance to carry around. I think Silniya's right."

He shrugs. "But as long as it works..."

Derleth chuckles. "Well, I couldn't have it my pocket, sure...but a silver font wouldn't be a problem for Platinum to carry."

Rosalie says, "What would you be looking for, Derleth? Doesn't Elucreh have the pipe now?"

Derleth says, "Well, I'd want to know who owned it, for one. The pipe could give us that information. And the font would be useful in other ways as well...maybe next time we see Leris, we nick some of his hair...and presto, we've got a link."

"Well," Silniya puts in, "I say we find Leris, when he's alone, and we pump him for information. Unless you think the scrying or the Tailor should be our next stop?"

Rosalie says, "I think grabbing Leris is a good idea. Can we render him unconscious and make him invisible somehow? He's more likely to talk if he knows his _family_ doesn't know about it."

Derleth says, "I've got an invisibility spell on hand, and I know Ky's got several. But I can't put fellows to sleep, I can only paralyse them."

Kyrel says, "I would think so. Grab him on his way to the Foxmantle's some morning, perhaps?"

Rosalie says, "Paralysis would be just as good. Or we could mug him." She winks. "Shouldn't be hard."

"A sap to the back of the head should put him down for a while," Silniya says with a brief grin.

Derleth laughs. "It has a certain direct charm."

Kyrel says, "Crude. I'll just put him to sleep. That's an easy spell."

Derleth says, "Easy spell...but if he has a strong will, he could resist it. A sap is a good backup policy."

Kyrel says, "True."

"Not to mention, if you jostle him when you pick him up, he could wake right back up."

Rosalie grins at Silniya. "So who gets to sap the lad? You or me?"

She considers. "I'll offer the honor to you. I don't think he'd be expecting a firm whacking from a noble lady, would he?"

Derleth smirks. "I'm not touching that with an eleven foot pole." he says in a rare display of coarseness.

Rosalie hmmmms. "I don't think, Silniya, that I'll look like a grande lady at the time. Why confuse Larcen's spies?"

"Who said anything about confusing spies? A potential customer, or a potential...mm, saddlemate?"

Rosalie raises one eyebrow only. "Saddlemate?"

Derleth chuckles. "Well, supposedly Leris and Shamnur were...going riding together."

Rosalie ahs, shrugging. "I see. Regardless, I think I would prefer to look a little ... grimier."

Silniya responds with a little shrug.

Kyrel grins. "If you're suggesting that one of you ladies dress up like a common trollop, you might be a little clearer. I don't think Rosalie knows all our code phrases yet."

Derleth grins at Rosealie. "You'd actually want to look grimy? Amazing."

Silniya lifts a brow, then chuckles. "I may very well get to use those cloths sooner then we thought."

Rosalie says, "I want to look, Derleth, like a thug. One who would mug inoffensive little trulls like Leris. Thugs aren't known for their bathing habits."

Derleth blinks, and then imitates a beet. "Uhm....ah....oh." he says intelligently. "In public?" he says to Sil. Clearing his throat, he looks back at Rose. "I understand your logic...I'm just get the impression that you prefer to...look good. Whenever possible." He grins, his cheeks still red.

Kyrel says, "In my bag of holding, which rarely leaves my belt, let alone my sight."

Rosalie grins at Derleth. "Ah. Of course. Cleanliness, after all, is next to godliness, is it not? Nonetheless, I can make the supreme sacrifice."

Derleth laughs. "Lady Rosalie, I salute you for what lengths you are willing to go." he says, only semi in jest.

Rosalie looks grimly serious. "A promise made should become a promise kept. I don't really like how slowly this is going; if I had a choice I would drag the lady herslf in for some ... questioning."

Derleth blinks at Rosalie's vehemence, and then nods. "I can appreciate the honor involved in keeping one's word..." he says respectfully. "Forgive me if I gave offense."

Rosalie shakes her head. "None taken. But I'll let you be the judge of my grime. When do we sap him? Tomorrow?"

"I would say tonight, my self," Silniya says.

Kyrel says, "Just don't break him. I think Lady Miller would be annoyed if we messed up her casting at this date."

Derleth nods. "Why waste time? The longer we wait, the colder the trail gets." He rummages through his disguise kit..."Have to come up with a different disguise, though...maybe I'll get out this beard and become a dwarf."

Rosalie says, "So tonight, after the show?"

Kyrel says, "After rehearsal's over. Show's tomorrow."

Rosalie says, "Ah. Pity. Darkness would help. Well, what shall I become, Derleth? I'm a little ... longlegged to be a dwarf."

Derleth Hmms. "Could turn you into a half-elf street urchin...how'd you like that?" He grins.

Rosalie nods. "Very well. We'll braid the hair back. Can we dye it? Darken it? Silver is ... uncommon."

Derleth nods. "Easily. We can use the henna I used to dye my hair red on a regular basis...and give your skin some color."

Kyrel says, "Or a Drow, maybe... she's got the hair for it..."

Silniya arches a brow. "I thought we were looking to Not draw attention."

Derleth shakes his head. "I agree. A drow would **definitely** attract attention. This isn't Skullport."

Kyrel says, "I thought we were just going to try for different? Never mind..."

Rosalie says, "Attention is fine. As long as they don't connect us."

"Well, it's a little... early to begin, no? Unless you're not wanting to wait until dark?"

"Oh, no no." Derleth agrees. "Some food, some rest...I want to get that font..."

Rosalie grins. "Why don't we wait. A little darkness is a good thing."

Rosalie says, ""Just a sec. Lemme desc?"

The four, after resting, Derleth's retrieval of a font, and a thorough disguising all around, head out just as the sky is turning indigo. Leaving seperately, they eventually do reach the Wide Realms, although Rosalie, in her urchin garb, gets quite a few looks, as she passes through the upper part of town.

All four arrive to the Theatre, soon enough.

Derleth is dressed up as a bushy browed dwarven thug, so he has an excuse to wear his armor and his flail...though he's dirtied it up some.

_Hand on hip, Rosalie stands slightly hunched over. Her beautiful hair is now a reddish blonde, and her skin looks darker, warmer, and covered in grime. Her jerkin and trews are old, stained, and obviously much mended. Not to mention filthy. Attention to detail has ensured that even her hands look chapped, with grime dug deep under the fingernails._

Rosalie looks around. "Is this the door Leris will use to exit, Kyrel?"

Silniya has found herself a dingy cloak, and some thicker clothing, allowing for a little padding. Hair made up into several braids, a fake mustache and dirt, with the hood hung low on her brow, passes as a brute of a man.

Kyrel is concealed under an illusion as a swarthy human merchant. "I'm not sure... but it's likely. This is the stage entrance, and I've got Kiri scouting the others."

Derleth was actually relieved that Sil decided not to wear one of the garments he and Rose purchased, to pose as a trollop...

Rosalie nods. "Very well. Why don't I watch this door from those shadows over there. And if you watch the other exits just in case ..." After she finishes speaking, Rosalie slides into the darkness, using the shadows to conceal herself.

Silniya opts to actually walk around the corner, leaving Kyrel and Derleth by themselves.

Derleth glances at Ky. "You wanna go in, make sure he comes out this way?"

Down a street, there's a shout. "Hey! Stop there!" The resounding sounds of arcane casting, and a crying yelp of pain.

Derleth blinks. "Dammit. Ky...stay here, but send Kiri, so you'll know what's there..." he dashes towards the commotion.

"Stay here!", Rosalie hisses at Derleth, as she moves towards the shouts. Whoever this is, is mine!"

Kyrel nods. _Kiri! Wing over that way, what's going on?_

Derleth blinks, coming to a stop. "uhm...okay."

Rose comes out around the corner, to see a few people gathered around... something. A richly dressed man is puffing out his chest, and walking stridently toward the little cluster of people. The sound of someone in excruciating pain contiues, coming from the gaggle of people.

_Two to one ... Leris shouldn't be a problem. And whoever this bastard is .. dammit, I_ like _Silniya._ Rosalie pushes forward, using her strength to push through the crowds.

There's an urchin, a young boy of no more then fourteen, clutching his hip. A glowing blaze of green is pulsating there, in a nasty, burning wound. Beside him is a pouch. The richly dressed man walks up, snatching the pouch from the ground. "Realms blasted pickpockets."

_Oh bloody hell. Now?_ Rosalie looks around quickly, trying to spot Silniya in the crowd. Then, stepping forward, she takes a moment to memorize the man's features before grabbing for the boy's hand.

"Come with me, boy." Rosalie drags the boy through the crowd, towing him back to where Derleth waits. She avoids Silniya's gaze. _The timing is lousy, but that's a cruel burglar trap._ "Dwarf! Can you help this boy?"

The people are dispursing. "Someone care to call the watch?" The 'victim' of the theft asks, as he returns the pouch to his belt. Silniya is standing in an alleyway, off of Rose's perifrial vision. The boy convulses, gasping in pain. The rich man looks down his nose at Rosalie gripping the boy's hand, before turning to walk off.

Derleth looks mostly confused as Rosalie appears out of nowhere, clutching a wounded boy. "Ah...aye, give meh a moment..." he says, trying to imitate a dwarven accent.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*dwarthy/swarthy

Kyrel nods to himself as his familiar relays the scene. _That was a very nasty trap - and a lot of power involved just to expend against a pickpocket. Keep an eye on him, Kiri.. looks like the others will keep the kid alive._

The majority of the onlookers have decided the entertainment is over, and now are filtering off.

Derleth moves quickly, calling on his goddess's favor to heal, his hands glowing as he touches the evil-looking wound...

Rosalie turns to Kyrel, growling. "Did you send Kiri? I want to know who that man is. A trap like that ... deserves a master thief."

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Switch that. Make 'swarthy', 'dwarven'.

The energies of Derleth's blessing flow inward, turning the scorched, melted flesh to meld back into itself, the burn marks gone.

Rosalie turns to kneel by the boy, waiting for him to wake up. She still looks absolutely furious, even as she lightly rubs the kid's forehead, cleaning off a smudge.

After a moment, he stirs with a start and a grunt, before looking up at Rosalie. His first reaction is to jerk backwards, onto his elbows. "Wha?"

"Ah....what was this all about anywhey, lassie?" Derleth says to Rosalie, trying to keep up the pretense.

Placing a hand on his chest, Rosalie keeps the kid pinned. "Now, lad, relax. You're fine. See? The pain is all gone, and you're with friends."

He looks around for a quick moment, then runs a hand to his hip. He looks up. "Oh... okay, next time, I don't steal from a wizard..."

Rosalie tilts her head. "A wizard? What seven kinds of fool are you, knowing the man was a mage? And why steal from him?"

He rubs his hip. "I didn't know he was a mage! Until he hit me with that... um, magic."

The stage door opens, two women giggling and talking among themselves, before looking out into the area.

Rosalie purses her lips together. "Right. Well, some day he will discover what the Brotherhood is capable of." She sighs. "But we have pressing business tonight. Will you sell me some knowledge?"

He looks Rosalie over quickly, before nodding. "Right, right, sure."

Derleth looks very confused, and makes way for the folks exiting.

The two women look at the gathered assembly, before moving rather quickly off.

Rosalie presses a single gold piece into the boy's hand. "Find me the name of that mage. And find me his address. His security measures offend. When you have them, give them to ... hmmm. Can you write?"

He looks down at the gold coin like he'd been handed a crown. Then looks up, nodding. "A little."

Kyrel is still watching the stage door, waiting for Leris. He'll nod to the girls if they look at him.

Rosalie says, "Good. Write a note to Lady Anya Foxmantle, with the address and the name. And include a way I can reach you." She stands, releasing the kid. "We'll have a good hunt."

He blinks... "Ah... okay, yes, okay. Um... thanks..." He then skitters off like a scared squirrel.

Derleth looks like he wants to know what that's about, but instead he moves into the background, away from Rose. He glances at Ky, nodding for him to get inside and find Leris.

Rosalie sighs. "Now, where were we?" Looking around, she takes a few steps back, blending once more into the shadows.

As Rosalie begins to ease back, the door swings open, and a familiar face strides out, the evening's intended target.

He pauses, turning to shut the door... and gives Kyrel a look, before closing it.

Rosalie keeps alternately checking Leris and the surrounding area, looking for the optimum ambush.

Kyrel doesn't look directly at the actor, pretending to be waiting for one of the actresses.

He proceeds to walk past Kyrel, then.

Derleth doesn't recognize Leris immediately, but as he sharpens his focus, remembers him from the altercation with the butler, at the party. He tenses.

After Leris walks past her, Rosalie steps forward, sap in hand, and swings once, to tap him lightly on the back of the head.

Rosalie's strike swings in, but her shoe slips slightly on a loose stone under her foot. Allthough she connects rather beautifully to the back of his skull, due to that little twist of her body, the blow isn't as hard as it could have been. Even as so, his head bounces forward, before lolling back, when knees collapse, sending him spilling to the earth below.

Rosalie carefully catches the sagging body, dragging him back into shadow.

"We have him," Rosalie whispers at Derleth. "What's next?"

Derleth moves over to Rose's side. "Next..." He murmurs a prayer to Lliara, and Leris's body, still in Rose's arms, dissapears from sight.

Kyrel heads into the shadows after them. "Next, we make him disappear. Can you carry him? Don't want him to get away."

Silniya pokes her head around the corner, having been tensed to dive in if need be. "I can carry him.

Rosalie stands, slinging the invisible body over one shoulder and anchoring him with one arm, which appears simply to be resting across her midsection. "Easily. Whereto?"

"Or not."

Kyrel says, "Not back to the Inn..."

Derleth glances around. "Some place that can't be traced back to us? Maybe we can find a warehouse."

Silniya walks forward. "A seedy tavern room would do. No need to take him back to Our Inn."

Rosalie nods. "And if we take him into the slums, we can just leave him behind when we're done."

Kyrel nods. "That should work. Plenty of dives."

After walking out of the rich part of town with a brisk pace, the group weaves towards the docks. Kyrel is eyed like a piece of meat, in there, considering his posing as a merchant, but they get a room for a few hours with little problem. Up the stairs, and into a room that's little more then a bed, a floor, and a window.

Kyrel chuckles. "They must think I'm the mark. Wouldn't they be surprised..."

Rosalie holds the invisible Leris hoisted over her shoulder. "So; how do we bring the man back?"

Derleth takes the time to bind Leris to a chair, his hands tied behind him. He doesn't bother to get out of his disguise, however. "Easier than I expected, that."

Kyrel says, "He should wake up soon enough."

Derleth has a little difficulty, simply because Leris is invisible.

Rosalie grins at Kyrel, sweeping a bow. "Rosalie Tarragonia. At your service. Glad I could help."

Silniya chuckles. "This chamber pot isn't empty. I know one way to wake him up."

Rosalie says, "I'd rather wake him _after_ we can see him ..."

Derleth laughs. "I like the idea...but we might wait till the duration ends. Otherwise we can't see his expression."

"Well, we can always make him attack us."

Derleth snorts. "Not while he's unconscious...and tied to the chair."

Rosalie settles down on the floor, her back to the wall. "I am willing to wait."

Derleth looks at Ky. "Unless you have a dweomer to dispel magic?"

Silniya hmms. "I have a better idea." She walks up to the chair, and puts her hand down, before drawing it back. Her other hand shifts to the front, and pokes, before wiggling in, tickling. After a moment, she winces, yanking her finger back, and Leris becomes solid. He doesn't look exactly awake, only stirred. She rubs her finger.

Derleth blinks. "How'd you do that?"

"I agitated the inside of his mouth til he bit me."

Derleth blinks, and laughs. "Don't knock it if it works...aright then...Rose, the chamberpot?"

Kyrel snickers. "Don't expect me to slap him later if you do that."

Rosalie grins. "Smart." She rises from the floor, and carefully hands over the slopping chamberpot. "Here. The smell alone should wake him."

Derleth puts the cahmberpot under LEris's nose, teasting that theory.

It works, actually. He jerks his head back, at the stench, coughing.

Derleth grins, and puts it aside. "Hello there laddie...have a good rehersal? because the day is gon' to go down'ill from there."

He shakes his head, and tugs at the restraints. A glance around. "What the hell? What's this about?"

Derleth winks under his bushy eyebrow. "Well, lad...we're goin' t' ask ye some questions...and ye're gonna answer them, aye? Or we'll be a mite...un'appy."

SIlniya walks over beside Kyrel, leaning against the wall, and letting the cloak ease back enough to show her sword hilts. Leris looks over the room, and glares paticularly Kyrel's way.

"Ah, ah...I'm the one ye need to be worrying about, Lad. Now then...we want t' know about ye're relationship t' the Foxmantles." Derleth says, cracking his kunckles under his gauntlets.

"Which relationship would that be?" He asks, returnning his gaze to Derleth.

Kyrel waves a hand languidly under his disguise, his voice accented with the sibilance of a Draconic accent when he speaks. "Busssiness, of coursse."

Derleth says, "Aye...specifically, with Missus Shamnur." Derleth adds.

"Business and pleasure," He answers Derleth.

Derleth smiles thinly. "Ah yes...ye're bouts of...riding. What an apt aphorism, that. But we're more interested in the business end...like, say, dealing with Dream mist..."

Leris nods. "Right. You seem to know everything you're asking. What'm I for?"

"Well, lad, here's what we don't know...did you get Lady Shamnur to kill Zaranda? or did ye get one of ye're cronies to do it?"

Rosalie observes Leris carefully, attempting to spot any attempt to lie.

"I didn't get her to do anything," He replies. "We had a decent little business going."

Derleth snorts. "Ah...so, she killed the bard as a favor to you? As a warning to others who got too depply into debt buying ye're narcotic?"

"Zaranda was working with me," He says with a snort. "Why would she kill Zaranda as a warning to others, if Zaranda was getting a cut?"

Derleth says, "Ah, that's not what we heard...we heard that she was killed because she over extended her credit paying for her nasty habit...So the bard worked for ye....and now she's dead. Any ideas who'd want to kill her, then?" Derleth queries.

Rosalie snarls. "Yeah. Which family member offed her?"

Leris levels a sour gaze at Dwarf-Made-Derleth. "I have some ideas, yeah." He looks to Rose. "Which family're we talking?"

Rosalie growls. "The humanoid family? The human family? Who cares. Who killed her?"

Kyrel hisses, "Ansswer the quesstion."

"Well, the Foxmantles are the obvious choice, laddie...are you saying they didn't? If she wasnae killed for her debt, then there are other...motives, attributable to the Foxmantles." Derleth drawls.

"You think that Shamnur would've killed her? She was getting me the mist."

Derleth taps his chin. "Maybe she didn't want Zaranda around...if'n she was partnered with you, it would mean she didn;t think Zaranda would be good for business...and she might have another source of the mist."

Rosalie growls at Derleth. "He's stalling. Want I should tap him again?"

Derleth makes a metal fist. "Nae....ah kin handle this butterfly easy enou'...."

Admiring her open hand, Rosalie grins. "I promise, I'll use an open hand rather than a fist. That'll leave fewer ... marks. He might even ... survive. Intact."

Leris's eyes flick left, right, more to Derleth's fist, then to Rosalie, before his lips purse. He looks concerned, before blurting out, "Lord Foxmantle."

Rosalie hahs. "He killed her, or he bought her death?"

Derleth blinks. "The lord himsel'? Why? Is he a business competitor in this Mist transaction?"

He snorts. "The fat ass did it himself. You let it slip that Zaranda's diddling his daughter, that they're about to skip town, and that Zaranda's been stealing from him, he wacked the bitch himself."

Derleth's brow creases. "What makes you think we told him?, eh?"

"That was the general 'you', shorty."

Rosalie takes three steps forward, hands on hip. "You're one insult away from a broken rib, Leris. And three insults away from dying slowly and painfully." She pauses. "So, tell us, how do you know the old man whacked her?"

Derleth glances at Rose. "Nae, dinnae threaten him with a broken rib...a broken nose t' that pretty face woul' 'urt 'im more..."

He leans forward. "If he didn't, then Who did? The man's all money. You threaten his money, and the propsect of his 'sinking' business, and he's off like a lizard with a flame under it's tail. His money's going down the hole because his Wife is pocketing it under his nose. Not to mention the steady supply from the mist, using the idiot's own caravans."

Rosalie shrugs at Derleth. "Right. Nose, rib, neck. Well enough." She turns to face Leris again. "So tell me, little worm, how would **you** prove that assertion?"

Derleth holds up a finger. "Shamnur and Zaranda both stealing from him? Ah kin see where that might make him a little rash..."

He shakes his head. "No. The bard was never stealing from him. But He doesn't know that, does he?"

Derleth arches an eyebrow. "Someone told him she was? And that, coupled with her shackin' up wi' his daughter, drove him o'er the edge?"

"Proof, little worm. Proof." Rosalie turns to Derleth, still growling. "Can't I break his nose, just to prove I'm serious?"

Leris nods. "Right." He looks up at Rosalie. "Why would I need to prove the truth?"

Rosalie turns back to the little worm. "Because when we hang the murderer out to dry, I want proof that I'm hanging the right murderer."

Derleth smirks. "Why, t' see justice done, o'course. If he killed your supplier, you have an interest in seeing 'im brought down, aye?"

"He Didn't kill my supplier. He killed my salesmen. I peddled it to the rich women, Zaranda slipped words in the right ears, while she was at the parties."

Kyrel nods. "Effen ssso. One lasst thing, then. Who iss your ssupplier?"

Rosalie moves to stand behind Leris, her sap handy.

Derleth waves a hand dismissively. "right, right...Zaranda sold, Shamnur supplied, is that it?"

"I've said it allready. Shamnur. She ships the drugs through Foxmantle's caravan."

Derleth acts like a thought suddenly occured to him. "One thing confuses me...if you had a deal doing with Shamnur, why were you stealing from her house?"

"A little pocket change on the side, from party guests doesn't hurt, does it?"

Derleth ahs and nods. "Ah well...then, that should be it, shouldn't it? Lord F did the deed....but who told him? He could have found out about his daughter by himself...but who gave him the faulty conclusion of who was filching from his pocket? Could it be Lerson an' his ilk?"

Derleth slowly takes off one gauntlet as he talks.

Leris shakes his head. "That, I don't know, really."

Derleth tilts his head, reaching out and running his fingers along Leris's hair. "But you don't think Shamnur would have done it? She had the most to lose, after all."

He jerks his head away, looking at Derleth. "How so?"

He bites his lip. "Well... it was her."

Derleth snorts. "Oh, so now you do know? Convenient."

Derleth pulls out some strands of leri's hair, and produces a dagger. "Is that the truth, now? Cause if it isn't, you'll lose more than a few strands, in a moment..."

He gaks! and winces, before inching away from the blade. "Would I lie to you?"

Rosalie growls, from where she's standing behind Leris. "Yes."

"All right. But, that's what I'm telling you, it was Shamnur."

Derleth smirks. "Aye...but we'll take yer word at face value. Be good naew...and dinnae try t' leave town. Or ye'll not get off as light as ye have t'night."

Derleth looks at Rose, and nods.

Rosalie taps Leris again, in the same place. Heavily enough to knock him out, but not enought to kill him.

Derleth takes the strands of hair, and tucks them into a pouch, for later. "Well....that was fun." he grins.

And Leris is unconcious, with an obvious slump in the chair.

Rosalie says, "Fun? So who killed the bard? Husband or wife? And can we punish them both?"

Kyrel says, "He did have some answers, when asked the right way. No proof, but ... it hangs together. Give this scenario to the Watch, let them put the pieces together, and deal with it however they see fit. You can tell Anya."

Derleth shakes his head. "I don't think we can prove either way, yet...but now, we know to start looking very closely at both of them..."

Rosalie sighs. "I'm not sure I want to tell Anya. Her parents murdered her lover, and smuggled drugs, and ... will she have any life left?"

"So," Sil parts in, "Are we selling Shamnur too? By the looks of it, by his story atleast, all she did was ship the Dream Mist."

Kyrel grins at Derleth. "My turn, now. Untie him, will you? It'd be a total pain to do that if he was already invisible."

Derleth nods and unties the unconscious Leris. "All yours, mage."

Rosalie says, "Why make him invisible at all? Why not just leave him, here?"

"Infact, we could just dump him in an alley out back," Silniya imparts.

Derleth chuckles. "The alley has a certain...charm."

Kyrel says, "All? Smuggling Dream Mist is hardly an 'all'. And why give him any shred of proof if he decides to spread a story about this evening around. Take him back to the theatre, dump him in an alley there."

Kyrel grins. "Besides, it has a certain symmetry to it. I'll do it myself if I must."

Rosalie shrugs. "Well enough. I'll carry him again; he weighs little enough."

Kyrel nods, and murmurs the incantation, the syllables harsher than the cleric's earlier prayer. "Thanks."

---

After unloading Leris into the Wide Realms' back alley, they head back to the Inn. In the morning, a note is recieved, to meet Elucreh at the Foxmantles' home.

Walking through the streets, towards the Foxmantle's, someone calls to Kyrel. "Hey, pal! You dropped this!"

Kyrel turns, puzzled. "What?"

Derleth blinks, looking around the direction of the voice.

A fellow in peasent's cloths walks towards Kyrel, holding up a pouch. A familiar one. A hand to his belt would discover, Hell, his Bag of Holding is missing.

He walks over to Kyrel, passing in front of an alleyway, offering the bag out. "Here y'go."

Derleth looks between the man, and Kyrel. "Is it yours?"

Kyrel blanches. "Thank you." He walks toward the fellow. "We'll know in a second."

Rosalie steps into the crowd, moving around to the entrance of the alley.

He dangles it forward. "You dropped it a little ways back, sir."

Derleth rests a hand on his flail, looknig worried.

Kyrel finds this a bit suspicious - it's not the sort of thing that's likely to happen, after all, with the precautions he takes - but he reaches out to accept it. "Thank you. Let me give you something...."

And as Kyrel takes the bag, the man's other hand comes forward, and Pinches his wrist. Electrical energy blasts from the man's hand, jumping up Kyrel's arms and right into his nerves, sending them spasming. However, if Rose doesn't turn around, she'd notice someone at the other end of the alley moving around, leveling a crossbow...
