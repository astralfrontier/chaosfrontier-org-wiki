# Inizii 2002-08-10

Logfile from PLKyrel

The spell's blast rocks Kyrel back, hair standing on end. Fortunate he is, for something whips past where his feet were, splattering across the ground in a big, gooy mess. The down-dressed assaulent looks up at the approaching people, and turns. He spots Rose, and swears, before making a quick footed start, and diving past her in a running roll. He comes back on his feet, hopping down the alleyway.

Silniya's hands were allready on her swords, taking the moment to yank them both free, before moving up after Rosalie. She points upwards, "There's a sniper on the roof. You going after that one?" A point toward the bowman and fleeing assaulant.

Kyrel says, "Not bad..."

Rose nods to Silniya, and goes headlong down the alleyway. Just as she nears the middle of the alley, something catches her foot. What? A tripwire. Prized agility serve it's purpose, allowing her to twist as she hits the air, landing on her feet... and sees the attack coming way too late. Blade and mace come at her, one leaping straight from the storm doors, connecting solidly with her hip. The other's shortsword skitters in a wicked slice across Rosalie's back. But, fortunately her momentum allows her to keep going, and just about ontop of the crossbowman, who now looks **very** paranoid.

Rosalie dives at the crossbowman, one hand outstretched to grab the crossbow, the other set to cold cock him, should he get in the way. And a toothy grin to convince him to cooperate. He does, and moments later she has the crossbow, and he doesn't. He looks a trifle worried.

The crossbow man shrieks. "Benny! She's got the crossbow! NOW!" From up on the roof, something is **shoved** off, falling right into the alleyway. A barrel, which's black contents cascade out, spattering Silniya, before the wooden container hits the ground, shattering fully, filling the entire alley opening with a dark stain, and something very distinct. Lamp oil.

Rose belatedly notices the crossbow quarrel doesn't have a pointed head, but just one wrapped in gauze. At the bowman's feet, is a lit torch.

Silniya inhales, staring at the gunk smeared all over her form. "Uh oh."

Derleth, even in his paranoid state before the man shocked Kyrel, was still slow to react as a hundred things seemed to happen at once...but when he sees something splash on Sil, he acts instinctively. Weaving his hands, he supplicates Lliara...and suddenly , several gallons apper directly above Silniya, and thoroughly douse her.

Silniya is bombarded with an enormous wave of water, relatively dimming the gunk on her, and soaking the wooden barrels, as well as soaking into the ground. Up above, 'Benny' spits down at Derleth. "Damn holyman!"

Derleth smirks at 'Benny's' reaction. _Right back at you, scum._

Kyrel staggers as the surprise attack jolts through his body. He staggers back, which makes the tanglefoot bag miss him, and spends a moment recovering his wits. When he does, the gestures and incantation are fiercer than usual, and the green bolts of the magic missile spell are stronger as well, arcing toward the supposed helpful peasant.

The fellow who'd hit Kyrel seemed a little smug with his excape. Infact, he turns around, his hand moving in the motions of quite the rude gesture... And he sees the arcane barriage coming at him, looking utterly surprised, as they simply **crunch** into him. He almost collapses in on himself, in a messy pile.

The crossbowman finally gets his wits about him, and simply backs backs away from Rosalie, fumbling for a weapon on his person.

One of the men who'd flanked Rose charges up, his short blade in hand. "Pretty's mine," he announces, before leading in with the weapon, while Rosalie is somewhat distracted by the unsuccessful archer.

...Only, the woman isn't so distracted. A shift of her placement, a swing of the crossbow cocking his stab out wide.

Silniya, smiling fiercely up at 'Benny', simply runs in after Rose, darting her sword down as she passes to snip the tripwire, then leads in on a heavy swing to the mace wielding knave. He makes a feeble attempt to move away, to block with his mace... and gets ran through, for his troubles.

The man on the roof simply ducks away. The crossbowman looks down the alley franticly, before throwing up his hands, at Rose. "Wait! No! I know them! Hey, Derleth, Kyrel!"

Derleth blinks, squinting at the crossbowman that's claiming innocense....

He looks reasonably familiar. Jamtlin. He's pretty much waving his hands franticly, and Moving Away.

Derleth groans. "Jamiltn, if you value your life, disarm and stay down! We have some trash to take out...."

Rosalie turns to the murdering short sword wielding thug, her hand still cocked back. But she's holding a crossbow, and between dropping the weapon and mistiming her swing, her fist whistles past his ear. And the crossbow clatters to her feet. She turns back to the crossbowman. "This is how you say hello?"

"Ho ho! Pretty's got bite!" The swordsman at her back chimes in... and looks behind him at his relatively dead or gone fellows. "Well shit."

Jamtlin can only shrug, and tries to pull at some false bravado. "Had to keep up the image I was on their side?"

Derleth takes out his flail, and strides towards the final thug. "Let's see...you're outnumbered, and outgunned. You got two choices. You can stand...or I can 'hit you'."

"Ah..." He looks at Rose, then Silniya moving in along side Derleth, then back at Rose guarding his back. "Well, I guess I'm just fucked, eh?" He decides to stab his sword into a nearby box, and just crosses his arms.

Kyrel concentrates and heads into the air, intending to find the fellow who was dropping stuff off of the roof. _First time I've actually used these boots since I finished them._

Doesn't take long for Kyrel to find him. The young knave is in the next alley over, hugging his left leg to him.

Derleth smirks. "Sil, keep an eye on the guy with the filthy mouth...oh, and sorry about getting you all wet."

Rosalie picks up the sword, and holds it to the thug's throat. "I'm thinking ... some apologies are in order, first off. And then some explanations."

Silniya just gives Derleth a 'Look', but she grins none the less. "So," She concludes to the fellow, sheathing her shortsword, to lean on the long blade. But, seeing as Rose has it under way, doesn't quite need ot.

Jamtlin walks closer, hands in his pockets. "Yes, how 'bout that explination."

Seeing that the last thug is well in hand, he strides over to Jamiltn. "Well, well...there's a old face. What are you doing so far away from Nemford, Jamiltn?"

"Oh, just... this and that. Putting my hand into whatever coffer I find, and all." He says, smiling.

"And Derleth", Rosalie continues from the side of her mouth, "after you've reassured yourself about Silniya's health, do you think you could do something about these cuts? They're beginning to sting."

The filthy mouthed fellow offers a smile that's equally grimy. "Ah...well, sorry there, Miss Pre- Ah... miss. All business, and all. Nothing personal."

Derleth has the good sense to look embarassed. "Oh, uhm...sorry, Rose." He goes to her side, still paying attention to Jamiltn. "And you just happened to hook up with a group that group that wanted to set us on fire, huh?" He murmurs a healing prayer as he touches Rose's wounds...

Kyrel smiles grimly as he locates the last of the ambushers, and moves to hover over the fellow. "Ah, there you are. Let's go back to my friends, shall we? Or do you want to argue with a lightning bolt?"

"Hey, I would've stopped before I set you guys on fire," Jamtlin says, assuredly.

The younger footpad looks up, then points to his leg. "Broke."

And, of course, he's definetly a-tremble, as if he's allready been hit by one.

Rosalie glares at the thug. "I want to inform you, sir, that regardless of your original intentions, this has just become intensely personal. Although perhaps ...", she leans forward just a little on the short sword, "perhaps somehat short, as well?"

He takes one look at the sword, then up at her. "Of course, right, yeah. So... what do you want to know?"

Jamtlin leans back, peering at the two lumps of his former comrads. "Them's dead, aren't they?"

Derleth uhuhs sarcastically at Jamiltn. He likes the boy, and he has been helpful in the past...but he doesn't trust him. "Dead enough, kid. Now spill. What's the story with these thugs? Who sent you?"

Kyrel sighs and writes a quick note for Kiri to carry to Derleth. _Got the last one of 'em here with a broken leg. Do we need to question him?_

The knave clicks his tongue. "Damn. That one owed me money, too. Huh? Oh, well, we were hired out to put a stop to some people putting their noses where it didn't belong."

Kiri chitters, flapping in Derleth's face, wiggling the note at him.

Rosalie glares at the thug, digging in the sword a little with each point. "I want to know, thug, who hired you. And I want to know, thug, how much he paid. And I want to know, thug, how you were going to justify burning down half the city. And I want to know, thug, why you should live much longer ..."

Derleth acks as he suddenly has a face full of bat. "Dammit Kiri, now's not the time to be dropping spiders on me...oh. Note." he grabs it. Reads it. Fumbles for a pen.

Derleth groans. "Wait...I don't need to do that. Kiri, just tell him, no."

Rose's cur is sweating sling bullets, at this point. He leans back a little, as she eases forward on that swordpoint. "Well, miss... We don't know. Or I don't know. Didn't meet the man..." He swallows, making a further cut in his throat. "He talked to..." His eyes move around the alley, and he looks relatively pained to say it, "Avos. Avos the Fisher. That's my boss. And you should spare me because... You're a giving soul, since you're trying to find a murderer, and all, and want the justice system to run me in?" He looks hopeful.

Rosalie pulls her short sword to the side, straightening her shoulders a little. Switching the sword to her left hand, she picks the thug up off his feet, and holds him up against the wall. "Thanks, Holy Man. That took the sting right out." She holds him there, pinned, while she looks down the alley to Silniya. "What do you think; should we run these gallant souls in? Or shall we return them to Avos the Fisher?"

Kyrel nods as he listens to Derleth through his familiar, then summons the bat back to him. He makes a show of talking to Kiri when he gets back, then smiles nastily down at the injured fellow. "Ah, too bad. They said we didn't need any prisoners." He raises his hand, pointing down at the fellow. "Unless you have something to change my mind...?"

Derleth glances over at Rose. "I think he knows more than he says. I didn't mention we were trying to find a murderer, did you?" he replies.

"Wait! No! I... Uh... I have a potion?" He suddenly looks very attentive. "That's right! And if you zap me, it'll break!"

Kyrel just looks amused, since he's still hovering over the kid. "I can make potions of my own, boy. I don't need your magic. I might be interested in information."

Rosalie grins at Derleth. "I concur." She grins, raising the thug just a little higher. "Shall we start with this murderer, then?"

Siliniya eases off the sword she's holding, and walks over, before perching beside Rose. Easing the blade into her hand, she casually uses the tip to stroke across the cur's sternum, then down, easing to the side, dragging the blade's tip down casually. With shifts of her wrist, the man's leathers are idly cut in a smooth pattern. "Well, I say we leave them near death in a sewer, gags in their mouth, so the rats can finish them? Bound and awake, of course, so they're there to see it."

Rosalie oooohs at Silniya. "I know just the treats to tempt the rats, too."

Derleth laughs at Sil. "I love it when you get bloodthirsty, dear...but the smell of a man soiling himself isn't very appetizing."

Kyrel's little hostage looks like he could either break into tears, throw the bottle at his side at the mage, or try and crawl away. "I... I don't know anything. I... I'm... just a Quipper...."

Jamtlin looks from one, to the other. "Wow. You guys got yourselves mixed in with a violent crowd, huh?"

Rosalie says, "Do you vouch for Jamtlin, Derleth? Or should I plan on saving him for later?" She shakes the thug on the wall again. "I'm not hearing enough answers, little man."

Derleth smiles at Jamiltn. "Adventurers are violent folk, Jamiltn. But then again, so are crime bosses you beat in a game of poker. How you feeling? Hurt anywhere?"

Of course, the knave in Rose's hands is trying to shrink into the wall. "What do you Want from me!?" His vocice cracks as he says it. "I told you! Avos knows!"

"Nah. She just... scared me a little." He looks at Rose with a little nervousness. "Nah, I ran from Nemford right about the time they found Ne'Ash's body all bloodless and broken."

Derleth says, "Jamiltn is vouchworthy, yes, Rose..." he trails off at the boys words. "Ne'Ash is dead? Really! Who did him in?"

Kyrel says, "A Quipper? What's that? Who sent you after us?"

Jamtlin shrugs. "Some dwarf. Came in one night, actually a little after you guys rolled me into town. He pretty much had everyone in the gambling hall quiet. Two nights later..." The boy shrugs.

Derleth blinks. "Ebrek has a long reach, apparently..." he grumbles.

"A Q-Quipper's a f-fish. And a gang! Avos runs it. Avos the Fisher. D-Down in the docks."

Rosalie turns back to the thug she's holding up. "The reunion is touching, Derleth. We will all hoist ale tonight, I'm sure. But ... do you know who this Avos the Fisher is?" She reconsiders, pulling the thug a little forward and shaking him for a few moments. "Or will we have to peel the knowledge out of this thing?"

Derleth glances between Rose and the thug. "Well, I'm sure we could encourage Jamiltn to tell us...but I wouldn't want to deprive you of your fun, Rose...I know how you love flaying your enemies."

He tries to take the shaking with as much dignity as his relatively terrified person can muster. When he's stopped shaking, "The docks! J-ah! The password's 'Tessa'. There's a-a Tavern. The Saucy Mermaid. T-t-tell the man in the corner... Tessa."

Rosalie grins happily. "Will he tell me more if I keep shaking, do you think?"

Kyrel drops a little lower, though still off the ground, then prods the boy's leg with the end of his bow. "Quippers are nasty little fish, yes. But they're not very big. You don't want to mess with us, boy, we're sharks. How do I find this Avos if I want him?"

Silniya leans on the wall, beside the propped man. "I'm sure a surface wound or two wouldn't hurt to free his tongue a little?" She turns to the man. "You know, you should tell him. She does have a habit of eating fingers. You'd be lucky to find a priest that could patch your hands together enough to feed yourself. Have to settle for acolyte Ilmaterians..."

"Ow!" He winces, and scoots away from Kyrel. "In this hollow, right under the docks. Right under the Saucy Mermaid."

The sound of clanking armor, before a "HEY!" Booms from the other side of the alleyway, from Derleth, Rose and company. A man in the Watch uniforms heralds, an upraised mace in hand. "What's going on here!?"

Several more step up behind him.

A watch soldier enters the alleyway not far from Kyrel. "Hey, you, mage, what's going on here?"

Rosalie grins. "Well, holy man, would you care to explain? I'll keep our present handy until they're ready for him."

Derleth waves to the watchman. "Oh, good morning, sirrah! That's very good of you to show up...we had a run-in with some brigands that wanted to turn us into living torches. We're just having a talk with the live ones, convincing them not to do it again."

The watchman's face screws up. "Well... Good work! Now, hand 'em over."

Jamtlin eases around the corner. "I think that's my cue to be going..."

Rosalie sighs. "No, Jamtlin. You stay right there." She turns, still carrying the thug, and puts him down in front of the watchman. "I apologize for the stench."

The cur crawls to the watchman, clinging to his shins. "PLEASE! Get them **Away** from me!"

Kyrel bows, pointedly standing on air. "Just trying to find out why the boy here tried to ambush my friends and I with a barrel of oil and a torch. He fell off the roof trying to get away."

Rosalie leans over a little, smiling. "Perhaps, little thug, you should confess?"

Derleth looks at Sil. "That's not very nice of him to say. After all, we didn't hurt him...." he says innocently.

The watch soldier approaches Kyrel and the boy, reguarding him, before nodding. "Gotcha. Come with me," He grabs hold of the boy's shoulder, pulling up... and earns a **wail** from the knave.

Kyrel says, "He really did break it. Don't think he's up to walking anywhere."

Trying to Extract the thug from his legs, the watchman grabs his collar, while trying to put himself between Rose and the thug. Two others take hold of the man's arms. "That's enough. Uh..." He reguards the dead men, then looks back to Derleth and Silniya. "You look familiar."

Silniya just reguards her bloody sword for a moment, before sheathing it, and reclines against the wall. "No respect," A little sigh, watching them cart the thug away.

The soldier frowns at this new development. "Hrmph." Crouching down, he grabs the young man by the armpits, hoists him up, and throws him over his shoulder, offering a supporting hand to the leg. "There."

++Editor: Sil cleans it on Mr. Splat's tunic, **then** puts it away. :)

The watchman spies Jamtlin. "Hey! What about him?"

Derleth smiles at the Guard. "Oh, we kill Talonites for a living. Maybe you remember us. But there are no more Talonites, so we're looking to branch out."

Rosalie sighs, and holds out the sword she'd picked up. "This belonged to him; I think it's intended as a donation to the Guard. Isn't it, little chap?"

Derleth shakes his head at the guard who spoke. "He's with us, let him alone."

The guard looks at Derleth, then Ooohs. He salutes. "There's good money in killing dragons, up north." He looks back to Rose, taking the sword. "It's a little dinged up but... Hey, thanks."

Rosalie grins at first, but the smile becomes noticeably strained as the guard finishes his sentence. Finally she nods, once. "Yes. Indeed." Her voice is a trifle ... cool.

Kyrel heads back to rejoin the others, first casting invisibility on his familiar and sending him to watch the Watchman. _Make sure he's what he claims to be. If he doesn't take the kid back to Watch HQ, I want to know about it._

The watchmen relatively clean up, and head off.

Silniya turns to look at Jamtlin, before back to Derleth and Rose. "What about the tag-along?"

Kyrel's voice comes from above as he settles back to the ground with the rest. "Jamtlin? You getting into scrapes again?"

Rosalie says, "I think he has something he wants to say to the man who asked us to meet him ..."

Jamtlin spreads his hands. "Hey, what the guy you treated like a punching bag said was the truth. Avos told us what to do, where to go, and how to do it. We never met the guy who ordered this."

Kyrel says, "That's what your friend on the roof said, too. I guess we'll have to go see him ... personally."

"Right. So... I'll just be going this way, then... Oh, by the way. I passed through Tarlbren on my way down."

Derleth nods. "Any news to report?"

"Guy named Tomals is kicking arse and taking names. He and a few friends had dragged in an owlbear corpse into town."

Kyrel smiles. "Good for him! How's the town doing, in general?"

Derleth laughs. "Now that's some good news."

Jamtlin leans in against the edge of the wall. "Eh, it's doing roughly all right. They were building something, don't know. But, all seems well, small town stuff."

Silniya looks to Kyrel and Derleth with a little smile. "Old haunts?"

Derleth moves next to Sil, his hand absently finding hers. "You could say that...Jamiltn, stay out of trouble, hmm?"

"And," The knave puts in, "Good work with them Talonites. Tarlbren got word of that. They're quite cheerful."

Silniya leans against Derleth, idly. "So, on to the Foxmantles?"

Rosalie nods. "Yes. This should be ... interesting."

Silniya leans down, sniffing her shoulder. "I want to clean off, first. I smell like a lamp wick."

"Didn't quite get it all off? Sorry, love." Derleth apologizes.

"The holy shower helped," She replies assuringly.

After cleaning up, the four head on to the Foxmantle manor, let in by the guards, who simply wave them through. "Hey!" Talbot spots them coming through the door, walking out of a hall. "How's things?"

Kyrel says, "Could be better, could be worse. Where's Elucreh?"

"Eh? Oh, I think he got here about ten minutes ago. Check the library."

Talbot smiles towards Rose. "And, how does the day treat you, hm?"

Rosalie chuckles ruefully. "Not too well. A few young men tried to get the better of us ..."

A chuckle comes from him. "And here I thought a lady like you would've learned how to dodge the persistent young men?"

Rosalie smiles thinly. "I hadn't bartered for this degree of persistence. But tell me, how does the day find you?"

"Oh, relatively well." A sigh. "We've been asked not to leave the city, so atleast the house arrest is lifted. Father's looking forward to tonight's play, to get away from the mess."

Rosalie looks intrigued. "Which play does he intend to attend? I've been considering taking in a play or two myself ..."

"Why the one tonight. The name excapes me..." He snaps his fingers. "Something about... a flute. I can't recall.

Rosalie smiles, beguilingly. "And have you decided to attend?"

"Oh, yes," Talbot nodded. "I intend to escort Anya..." A brow raised. "Unless you'd prefer to join me, mayhap?"

Rosalie tilts her head sideways. "Why not escort us both? I'd be delighted to attend."

Talbot says, "Certainly!" He looks to the relatively silent other three. "Will you all be going, too?"

Derleth chuckles. "Is that allowable? One man to escort two women?"

"Only the lucky ones." He winks.

Kyrel says, "You escort Silniya, and I'll sit beside Anya to make it balanced. Fair enough?"

Talbot considers. "Yes, perhaps you could offer to escort my sister, yourself, Kyrel? She's been so down, lately. Good, to get her off with a man." He blinks. "My Gods, I sound like Father."

Rosalie nods at Talbot. "You know, you do ... but I'm sure Anya will appreciate the thought."

Kyrel grins and makes a half-bow. "I'll be sure to ask her, then, since I have your permission. Some folks would take offense at my presuming to ask someone of her station." He straightens up again, the grin fading. "Still, we have to talk to Elucreh."

Derleth nearly chokes at Talbot's choice of words.

The nobleman looks at Rosalie curiously, at her trailing of something. But, he doesn't say anything, simply nodding, before grinning to the wizard. "Not to worry. I don't think it'd be minded. Now, up the stairs."

"Bless you," Silniya says over Derleth's shoulder, to cover the action as a sneeze.

Elucreh is indeed in the library, looking over some notes, saying goodbye to a maid, who passes the group as they walk in. He looks up. "Oh, hello."

Kyrel frowns. "We got your note. Or did we?"

"Or who's what?"

Kyrel says, "What did you want to see us about?"

He hrms. "I didn't much need to see you on anything, actually. Why?"

Derleth says, "Someone pretended to be you to get us into a position to serve up oil-fried adventurers."

Silniya snorts. "Not a very hot idea, really."

Kyrel says, "That's... what I was afraid of. Someone sent us a note, in your name, and tried to ambush us on the way here."

The detective hms. "Well... I see you all got yourselves out without much harm." He frowns. "Well then. Obviously whoever did it has some knowledge on what we're doing here."

Derleth wraps an arm around Sil's waist. "Well, naturally. You had to clean up as a result." he teases.

Kyrel says, "Aye. Does the name 'Avos' mean anything to you?"

Rosalie says, "Avos the Fisher, to be precise."

Elucreh eases into his chair. "Yes, actually. There's been a ring of thefts from ships, warehouses, so on, for about a year or so, now. We've gotten hints of a man named 'Avos', but havn't been able to nail down anything."

Silniya leans against Derleth. "Mmhm." She looks up. "We're going to be going out, again, aren't we?"

Kyrel says, "Someone used him to set up the ambush, it looks like. We might have a lead on him."

Rosalie nods. "To the tavern, for an afternoon drink, Sil?"

A grin is shot back to Silniya. "No leashes."

Elucreh chuckles, idly. "Just cleaning up all of our city's problems, aren't you?"

Rosalie nods at Silniya. "No leashes. I think we're going slumming for this one. After all, they did keep reiterating that we were pretty ..."

Sil waggles a finger. "I distinctly remember him leering at You."

Rosalie grins. "Keep me company?"

Kyrel chuckles. "It's not that we're trying to... but they _will_ keep coming after us."

Elucreh leans forward. "All right, then you're going to look in on Avos. Be careful. We **do** know from what we've got, there's a vicious gang called the Quippers. A man I know in the Watch is more knowledged on this sort've thing, really. But, tough crowd. Anyways, what about this case, now? We have all day, let's get to work."

Rosalie says, "Where shall we start?"

Kyrel chuckles. "Yes, that's what one of our ambushers said afterwards. I think he was trying to alarm me, but it didn't work. We turned the survivors over to the Watch people who showed up. As to cases... "

Elucreh leans back, after Kyrel explains the information given by Leris. "Well... that certainly is one possibility. And sound reasoning... Now the question is, would this be the actual one?"

Kyrel says, "A very good question. But I would think that a scenario gives your people specific things to look for, either to prove or disprove the idea."

Silniya moves to sit. "If it's the truth, then both of Anya's parents are in for it."

Rosalie nods. "What will happen to the children if the parents are implicated?"

Derleth shrugs. "Well, is it a crime to steal money from a murderer? Granted, he wasn't a murderer at the time..."

Kyrel shrugs. "They're of age."

"Most likely," Elucreh puts forth, "They'll earn full power over all of the estate. And thus, the full responsibility."

Derleth looks at Elucreh. "Do you think I should try keeping tabs on Lord Foxmantle? See if I can turn up some proof?"

The detective nods. "Nothing wrong with re-questioning either Foxmantle, now with the new information. See if they sweat, at all."

Derleth shakes his head. "I'm talking about things like scrying, Detective. And other magical means of watching him. Or is that legal?"

Kyrel turns his head. "Oh, for... just a moment, I've got to go yell at the staff." He heads out to rescue his familiar.

Elucreh lifts his voice. "Scrying is an Invasion of Privacy. And we of the Watch Don't use it for our means." He winks at Derleth.

Two servants with brooms are trying to shoo Kiri out of the foyer. Kiri, squeaking in protest, is flying above them. Kyrel can catch several of those squeaks as unpleasantries.

Derleth smiles to himself. "Of course, Detective. Wouldn't want to break the law, now would we."

"Not at all. Glad we see eye to eye here."

Kyrel clears his throat. "What _do_ you think you are doing?"

One of the servants wheels around, and whacks the other accidently on the elbow with the edge of his broom. "Ow!" "Oh, sorry. There's a bat..." Said bat is winging to Kyrel, landing on his shoulder, and ruffling his wings in aggitation.

Kyrel frowns. "Yes. He's my familiar. Don't you two have something useful to do? Annoying a wizard isn't really healthy."

"Right!" They immediately seem to find something needing their attention. In oposite directions, briskly fleeing the hall.

Kiri hmphs.

Derleth folds his fingers together as he leans on Sil's chair. "Badgering Avos would seem to be the next step, from our end...I'm sure you can requestion the Foxmantles without our help..."

Kyrel calms his familiar and scratches his head as he heads back up to the study. _Did they take our opponents back to the Watch station?_

Elucreh nods. "I figured you'd prefer to; you were handling things just fine."

Kiri chitters the affirmitive, and finds a comfy place to wiggle into Kyrel's clothing.

Rosalie says, "I think we'd be ... delighted ... to badger Avos." Rosalie examines her nails, then examines one more closely. "In that encounter I broke a fingernail."

Derleth blinks at Rose. "That's impressive. Aren't your nails a little...tougher than the average persons?"

Silniya chuckles. "You were rough enough on him, wern't you? Maybe you should be my body guard."

Rosalie shakes her head. "Not really, no. Not as far as I know." She worries at the fingernail. "But now I definitely have a grudge to pick with Avos ..."

"So, will you all be heading into uncertain peril?" Elucreh offers with a smile. "Or, something like your earlier venture, with Larcen?"

Rosalie smiles. "I think I'm going to dress down a little. Blowsy dress, low neckline, the usual ... Easier to reel in the fisherman if you have the right bait ..."

Kyrel comes back, still chirring to his familiar. "Well, that's taken care of. The ambushers are safely put away by the Watch."
