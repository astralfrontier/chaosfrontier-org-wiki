# Inizii 2002-08-21

Logfile from PLKyrel

Heading back to the Halfway Inn to retrieve the disguise kits, Rosalie and Silniya set to work. Rose, looking as a 'working woman' of the docks, while Silniya as a choppy-faced seafaring woman, who would go quite well with Kyrel, who's to pose as a sailor. Derleth was planning on using a spell of his own, but at nearly the last minute, a message calling him to Lliara's service sent him away, despite his initial suspicion; it turns out the missive was delivered by a messanger wearing Lliaran robes.

_Rosalie leans in the doorway, one hand on her hip. A low cut blouse droops down, gathered at the waist by a full but short skirt. Her hair hangs loose, in lanky strings. A small bow holds a few strands by the side of her head. She smiles blowsily, as the reek of gin pervades the air ..._

Rosalie walks a little apart from Silniya and Kyrel. After entering the docks part of town, she gets several looks, and even a few catcalls. The Saucy Mermaid is not far from the water's edge. A curious eye would note that there seems to be many boats in the water, if not several people lining the docks, that lead out into deeper water.

Opening the door, Rosalie pauses in the doorway. She's swaying a little, as she surveys the room. Finally, she totters to a table. "Gin, Tessa. Gimme some gin!"

Rosalie heads in first, but Kyrel and Silniya hold back, before following. A young boy, no more then eight, is sitting outside the bar, perched on a barrel, but doesn't look up as they pass. Rosalie gets a few eyes, as she enters; from several of the patrons, and a sharp looking man near the bar nursing a mug. In the far corner, a drunkard leans, idly rubbing his peg leg, besides lolling his head, now and then.

A hardened barmaid, an expression, demeanor and relative apperance more akin to a dungeon guard storms through the hands that reach out for her passing, to stop at Rose's table. "What you be wanting? Gin, you said?"

Rosalie nods, slapping a coin on the table. "Aye! Gin I be wantin'."

A nod is given, the copper scooped up. Once more marching through the throng, bumping a table, and a man's elbow in the process, she makes it to the bar. Kyrel and Silniya enter, as the drunkard chuckles. "Hehe."

Rosalie drapes her chin on her clasped hands, and slowly surveys the men at the bar, her eyes drooping half shut. Then she straightens a little, and fondles her hair.

One of the 'gentlemen', a term as loose as Rose poses, leans forward tot try and grab at her arm. "How much be ya, tart?"

++Editor: 'Gentleman' at the next table, that is. ;)

Rosalie tilts her head sideways. "For a man as ... talentless as you, laddie, I be costing five gold, at least. I likes my men ... washed."

That earns a hearty laugh from the other men at his table. "How 'bout we dunk you into the brine, boy, and wash you up fine for your woman!" Another round of snickers. Silniya nudges Kyrel, a questioning look toward the drunk. Muttering, "Didn't they mention a man in the corner?"

Rosalie chuckles along. "And washed in fine clean water; none of the salt of the sea on them." She looks around, expressively. "But m'contact said there was good ... men to be had here. Young, stout, strong. The kind of man could shelter a wee lass in the storms ahead ..."

Kyrel nods, murmuring back, "Aye, but they didn't say which corner. Let her deal with it."

The waitress returns, planking the gin, bottle and all, down. "Don't be plying here. Only salty and scurvy come in, here." "Storms, y'say?" Comments the other neighbor to her table. "You some witch, woman? Or you just looking for some hours' shelter?"

Rosalie shrugs. "A few hours, belike. It looks fair to rainin', soon."

The man close to the bar has yet to let up his scrutiny. The drunkard stretches, before putting his head onto the table. "Really?" Comments a bass voice from a little to the northeastern direction from Rose. Older, tanned, and just a slight five o'clock shadow reads over weathered features. "Five gold's pricy, for a woman coming Here." He gets up from his table, to pull it out, and sit at Rose's table. "A trollop with taste? Sounds blasphemous."

Turning to look at the older man, Rosalie grins lopsidedly. "Well, having seen the best ... it's sad tae be seein' the worst. And a lady does have a few standards left." She lets her voice trail off suggestively, her hand caressing the gin bottle.

A little chuckle issues forth. The man's dressed well, a doublet of worked leather, laced through with dyed throng. An almost clean shirt, to boot. Several men seem to have lost interest in this conversation, now, and looking to their own business. "Mmhm. A little cleaning up, I'd be wagering there'd be wager in other parts of town, even."

"Aye, but cleanin' up takes coin. 'Tis a vicious cycle, isn't it?" She pauses, pouring herself a healthy drink. "And a nasty one for a poor innocent lady like myself tae be trapped in ..." She drinks, slowly, apparently savouring the rotgut gin.

A little smirk befits the man. "Poor, maybe. Innocent?" A spread of his hands. "Forgive an old sea dog for his nose."

The man near the bar has reluctantly given up his heavy scrutiny.

Rosalie shrugs, tilting her head. "Indeed. Well; will you be the port to ny storm, then?"

A hand lifts, tipping the imaginary cap. "Certainly. Your shoes are for walking?"

Rosalie leans back, looking morosely at one booted foot. "These can't be dancin' slippers I see before me now, can they?"

"Very well. Then," He says, scooting his chair back, "Shall we?" A hand outstretched.

"Soon enough, sir, aye. Will't share a meal and a name with me, first? I do like to know who my ports are, and I'm fair ravishingly hungry." She looks up, from under her eyelashes, smiling appealingly like a little girl lost.

He seems amused. "It would seem I've elevated up from enjoying company for coin, to taking a lady out to dine." A tip of his head. "Forgive, but ever a businessman," This earns a snicker from one or two lips, "Then how about the food be deducted from your fee. My treat, of course."

Rosalie visibly pauses, looking at the kitchen and fingering an almost empty pouch on her belt. "If needs must, a simple meal will not deduct much from my five gold. You may call me Sally."

A nod given. "True, true." He clears his throat, looking back, before the waitress begins walking back over. "The lady would care for a meal." This earns a little dirty smile from the waitress, before her attention turns to Rosalie. "What is it, then?"

Rosalie straightens up, politely informing the waitress that she will have a bowl of stew, and bread. "And you ... ah ... sir? What will you have?"

"I'll be having a bit of chicken." She nods. "And, to drink, Captain?" "Same thing I was having; a bit of that Black Adder ale."

Rosalie turns to the captain, smiling happily. "You have a ship, sir?"

He turns his head back, to regard Rosalie. "Yes ma'am. The _Azure Dagger_. I'm Captain Amrakt Helden."

++Editor: Not Azure Dagger; the _Sirene's Call_.

Rosalie smiles happily. "A friend of mine suggested this tavern; smart lad he was. Said I'd find a port for years ta come. And he promised velvets, too. All I hadda do, he said, was look pretty and mention Tessa ... And here I am, all fallen in clover already."

Both the man by the bar, and the corner drunk seem to stir, at that. Infact, the one by the bar stands up, walking toward the door. Amrakt smiles a bit. "I don't think there's a woman by that name here; and I've been coming here, ever since I frequent the ports."

Rosalie looks all confused, biting her lip. "How odd ... he wouldn't have steered me wrong. He was too cute."

"I'm surprised he didn't offer purchase, himself. And, how long have you been here, within the city... Sally?" The man starting to the door walks out.

Rosalie raises a shoulder. "Walked in a week ago. I thought I'd be able to find better clientele, but this is a tough town."

"Indeed." Reaching into a pouch at his belt, five coins are produced; their gold shines as he sets them infront of Rose. "Best easily payed up front, hm?"

At that, the man who left walks back in, and returns to his table.

Rosalie lifts each coin up carefully, sliding it into the pouch after examining it carefully. "Paid in full, aye. This will buy you an afternoon, indeed." She smiles.

"Afternoon," Amrakt says with a chuckle. "When I was younger, it was well into the morning."

Rosalie smiles, winking. "Aye, but a lady has standards. The full night is far more expensive."

A familiar sharp-eyed dwarf strides into the tavern then...swivelling his head this way and that, as if looking for someone. He looks a bit harrowed.

A wave of his hand. "I ment my verility, Sally, not the costs."

Silniya, appearing as a worn down sailor, nods to the dwarf, before nudging Kyrel.

Kyrel nods and beckons the dwarf to join the two of them.

Rosalie tilts her head sideways. "A fine man like you. I'm sure you'd last the full night with a pretty lady." She finishes the last of her stew, delicately licking the spoon. "In fact, I'm quite ... sure of it. Perhaps some evening ..."

Amrakt chuckles heartily. "Well, we'll see, hmm? I'd warrent you're pretty enough. Of course, being at sea as long a stent as I was, a dragon would harken some lechery from me. We'll see how things go; if these old, salty bones are more alive then I believe, then there'll be more coin to it."

The dwarf raises his tufted eyebrows, as if wondering what he just walked in on as he joins his companions, glad his illusion hides the blush that comes to his cheeks.

Rosalie looks intrigued, at the mention of more coin. "Even a dragon, sir?"

"Mm... perhaps. Depending." A wave of his hand.

Silniya mutters, "So, we're not going to try and pull her out of this one?"

Derleth-as-dwarf nudges Sil. "What's going on?" he whispers up at her without looking at her.

She points towards the Captain and 'Sally'. "She was looking to find Avos. And it looks like her disguise is too good..."

Kyrel nods, not looking in that direction. "We may have to come back tomorrow and try again..."

Derleth blushes more behind his dwarven illusion. "Ah..." is all he manages. "Uhm...should we intervene? I mean...she can probably take care of herself..." he murmurs beneath his beard.

Kyrel murmurs, "If we intervene, it will completely blow our cover. We can't in here, at least."

Rosalie stands up, the gin bottle left abandoned on the table. She holds out a hand to the captain. "Shall we, then?"

Amrak rises, and takes the hand. "Right, then. Onward to the ship."

Rosalie follows the captain out of the tavern, her shoulders straight, with only a quick grin for her compatriots.

As Rose exits the tavern, she could note, on her way towards the docked ships, that the throng of fisherman upon those long docks have grown a little thicker.

Rosalie nudges the captain. "Why the crowds?"

Derleth seems amazed at how far Rose is taking the charade...but...he follows the others lead and makes no move...

Amrak gives a shrug. "I've no idea. I guess the fish are biting, today."

Rosalie pouts a little. "Maybe later ... we can find out?"

"Certainly," He mentions, before nodding toward a high masted ship, not far off. "That's her."

After leaving the Tavern, Silniya, Derleth and Kyrel head back to the Halfway Inn. Nearly at six, Rose arrives, not commenting much, but certainly ordering a bath. Everyone gets dressed, and ready, for the play. A little listening within the mainroom earns them the title, atleast. _Twelve Notes' Ring_.

Talbot is waiting just within the door, dressed in finary for the occasion. As is Anya, with a flowing gown of purple and green.

Derleth decides he can't risk not going armored...but he polishes his armor to a shine and wears his formal surcoat over his breastplate.

Dressed up in her fancy dress, Rosalie makes a grand entrance. She turns to give Anya a quick hug. "We're getting closer, I promise", she whispers in Anya's ear.

Silniya, despite a little fretting, is wearing the same gown she did to the Foxmantles' ball. She descends the stairs, on Derleth's arm.

Anya gives Rose a hug back, smiling a little. "Thank you," She murmurs into the woman's ear. "Now," Tamlin chimes in, "Where's Kyrel?"

Derleth chuckles as he stands with his gorgeous companion. "Probably dressing his bat in little pink bows..."

Silniya chuckles. "I think Kiri would be tieing them in Kyrel's hair, too."

Derleth does not lean on Sil...armor isn't made for snuggling. He looks like he wants to, though. "Good point...but can bats tie bows?"

Kyrel says, "I heard that!" Kiri squeaks indignantly, too, as they arrive. The half-elf, as usual, refuses to wear the usual mage's robe, but is dressed fairly fashionably in a tunic with flowing sleeves, leggings, and his flight-boots. "Are we all set?"

Derleth eyes Kiri, making sure the bat has no spiders to drop on him.

Rosalie grins. "I think we are." She turns to Kiri, offering a small sliver of ham. "It's not spider, but ..."

Anya offers the mage a smile. "You look dashing," She comments, and walks over to offer him a slight courtsey. "Shall we be off, then?"

Derleth chuckles. "I'm ready..."

Tamlin draws forward, offering his arm to Rosalie. "Your chariet awaits, madam."

Kiri swoops over to grab the sliver of ham. Kyrel smiles. "Thank you, Anya. Let us be on our way."

Rosalie smiles, accepting Tamlin's arm gracefully after Kiri has collected his snack, her other hand lifting her skirts carefully out of the way. "This play sounds most intriguing, Tamlin. I do thank you for the treat."

"Tis my pleasure; let us hope we can make a most of it." Two coaches were called, instead of the one, due to a worry of overflowing. The playhouse is abustle with activity, many people milling about, and looking forward. The Wide Realms usually puts on quite a show. Everyone is lead to the second floor, and a small hallway leads to the left side. A wide box of seats offers a perfect view of the stage. Lord Foxmantle is seated in the front, and turns. He stands, and offers a polite nod. "Welcome. Ah... All of you."

Derleth nods cautiously...looking over the man and wondering if he really did the foul deed...

Rosalie smiles happily. "Thank you, also, for hosting us. This is a most wonderful treat."

"Gladly," He offers. "Though, it was my son's idea, of course..." Tamlin grins. "Where is mother, Father?" Anya asks, as she moves into the last row of seats. "She's downstairs. Up to mingling, as it was, though I admit I'm not much for it, now."

Everyone takes their seats, as the house's magelights are lowering. The first act begins, introducing the plot. King Marquel, a king of supposedly good merit, has begun to slip, in his carreer. It would seem that not many have made notice, save a frequenter of his court, a well known storyteller, floute player, not quite the King's foul. Other elements are hinted at, such as the King's affiliation with a group of brigards. Undoubtably, by the setting tone of the play, not to mention lack of humor, except the witty tiff between King and Courtman, that this is turning toward a Tragety. Much is the works of Hennyn Everquill's plays.

The courtain closes, slowly, to some applause. Before it went up, though, Lady Foxmantle arrived, in all her finery, to settle beside her husband, on the front row of the box.

Kyrel recieves a tapping on his shoulder, from behind. Quietly, "Excuse me."

Kyrel turns, rather suspicious after the alley ambush the day before. "Yes?"

The Mill is standing behind him, a smile perched. "Perhaps when you have time, might I speak with you?"

Kyrel twitches an eyebrow upward. "Certainly, milady. This is ... unexpected. Now? Or perhaps after the play?"

Anya turns, to regard the preciding theatre owner, but remains quiet. Silniya inclines her head, offering to Derleth, "You know, I've only seen one Play, like this, before."

Rosalie leans back in her chair, fanning herself with her program. "A fascinating play."

She spreads her hands. "Mm... The next intermission, if not the third? There is a balcony, overlooking the city, at the end. I'll unlock the door, if you would? I realize this is rather unannounced, but I realize that unless you persue me, or I you, that it won't come about."

Tamlin nods. "Indeed. I've seen several of Everquill's plays. A good writer, he is."

Kyrel nods and murmurs his acceptance. "Next intermission, at the end balcony."

She nods, and eases back out of the doorway. "The second, then."

The second act, things become a little more grim. As it turns out, the courtman has done a service for the King, some years back. A minor thing, really; a debt that the king hadn't payed. When the Marquel is confronted with this in court again, it is completely balked at, the flute player thrown from court. The scene is a fortnight later, things do not look good for the ruler. Rumors are like wildfire, things are being spread with rapid ease. At the end of the Act, the fluteplayer meets his end at the hands of brigards, who comment upon Marquel's ire.

Kyrel starts to watch Lord and Lady Foxmantle as much as the play as the plot unfolds.

Thorvald seems to be enjoying himself, until near the end, which leaves him much befuddled, if not looking behind him a few times. Shamnur seems uneffected, relaxed.

Kyrel slips quietly out just before the second intermission, pausing in the hallway outside the box to check for observers. Seeing none, he murmurs the harsh syllables and vanishes from sight along with his familiar even as the bard is killed on stage.

Kyrel makes his way to the end box, slipping inside just as the other doorways open.

Kyrel quickly looks around, but sees no one but the Mill, who is looking at the box door in some puzzlement. "Good evening. I thought it best to remain ... unobserved. An interesting play, so far. Somewhat ... suggestive?"

She lifts a brow, but doesn't comment. "Yes, actually. It's somewhat of a... tribute. Just watch. It so happened we simply had the script, and pulled it out of hiding."

Kyrel nods, then realizes that's rather pointless while he's cloaked by the spell. "I see. Lord Foxmantle seems a bit uncomfortable at the moment. Anything in particular we should be watching for?"

"Oh, I don't think it will help your cause, but the play is a touch... Poetic." She smiles. "But, I also called to speak. I imagine you're not to be staying in Selegaunt long after this?"

Kyrel says, "Probably not too much longer. I've about exhausted the possibilities of the local bibliophiles, and we have other things we need to attend to. Promises to keep, you understand..."

She smiles. "Of course. That, though, is where my interests are. Where do you plan on heading, I ask?"

Kyrel automatically shrugs, then shakes his head at himself. "South, probably. Unless something comes up we'll be taking our ... skinny ... friend home to rest."

"Ah ha." A nod. "I was to offer that, if you desire, I could use my connections to get you rooms reserved along the road, relatively safe ways to travel, so forth."

Kyrel chuckles. "But if the road's too safe, we won't be able to take any bandits in for the bounty. We're most likely heading to Evereska."

Kyrel continues. "Let me talk things over with my companions. We'd appreciate the offer, I think, but I shouldn't accept for them."

"Ah ha. That's to the south a touch, and then East, along the Inner Sea." A nod. "Of course. What is it you're going for, I ask? Not to Evereska, but simply, any agendas? Unless it's personal, of course."

Kyrel says, "Well, the only agenda is that we promised a ghost we'd take his body home to rest. We've had a bit of a delay here, but it's time to finish that job. After that, we'll see what turns up. Something usually does."

Another nod from the woman. "Well, as said, I would not mind finding information for you. What you're doing to find Zaranda's murderer, I appreciate. And, even if you don't deserve a reward, consider it a 'thank you'. She was a friend to me."

Kyrel sighs. "She was mixed up in something nasty, apparently, but she didn't seem a bad sort. And she did a song about us. I must admit that appealed to my vanity."

The Mill chuckles to that. "Well, remember, my door is open."

"This would be free of charge."

Kyrel says, "I'll remember. And ... thank you."

"Right, and thank you." A soft smile. "I know she was mixed up with unfortunate things. But, sadly, in many situations, there are wheels within wheels, webs touching everything. Sometimes, there is little choice, others, only benefits, for in some cases, totally harmless setups. Initially."

"Now, hurry back, the play is soon to begin again."

Kyrel says, "I will. Don't want to miss any of it."

As if on que, the curtains begin to pull up.

Kyrel hurries back, cancelling the spell as he slips into his seat.

Before the play begins, Anya turns. "What was that all about?" A crooked smile. "Unless it was all hush hush?"

Kyrel smiles. "She wondered where we were heading after we finish up here in Selegaunt."

Anya nods her head, and relaxes against the mage. "Thank you for offering to get me out of the house. I've been shut up in my room since the Ball..."

Kyrel hmmms. "You shouldn't do that. I know you're upset by what happened, but you've got to stay active."

A pat to Kyrel's hand. "I know. I know. But I havn't had much excuse To do it."

Kyrel shrugs. "Make an excuse. Go riding or something..." He breaks off as the curtain rises. "We'll talk later, all right?"

"Yes."

The third act begins with a messanger arriving to Marquel, with a small bundle and a message. The courtman's fate is sealed, and within that package, the man's own instrument. Marque's soliloquey endears his idle interest in the flute; a little trophey, to be hidden away for him. At the end, when he slips it into his coat, a single note is played. He pauses, but goes on. As the scenes progress, things are going ill, about the kingdom, paticularl with Marquel's deeds. The brigards, it's reported, were found, but all dead sans one man. He speaks to the king, in his binds, within a cell, ranting about the winds, the haunting winds. After so long... the men turned on themselves. The king dismisses him, but upon returning to his court, the sound of the flute is heard, slow at first. Upon every step the king makes, though, it seems to grow louder in volume.

Rosalie looks thoughtful. _I wonder if Zaranda had a favoured instrument ..._

As the act begins, Marquel's court seems to be a little disheaveled. Members are gossiping about the king's constant absences, his lack of attention, the looking over his shoulder. Many have commented upon his personal attendant, one priest to Lathandar, always seems to be with him, if not close by. Then, it cuts to somewhere outside of the kingdom, two servants burying a box fully informed that they not open. Only, accidently dropping, opens to expose the flute. It's hastily then put into the earth. In the next scene, Marquel is definetly depicted as starting to loose his mind. The solilique is rambling, disjointed, about the flute's steady play. And it's interrupted, as the song picks up again. The fluteplayer appears, and screaming, Marquel slays him... Only to discover, to utter horror, it is the very priest that was helping his wary mind. He then flees to the roof, following those haunting notes... It seems the whole castle follows him, many people gathering, as he begins to scream upon the ghost,

confessing in anger. His end, sadly, comes upon a struggle that sends Marque over the edge of the castle.

Thorvald is utterly quiet, while Shamnur seems still the very cool demeanor. The curtains fall, to the applause of the audiance, commoners int he yard, others in seats. As the curtain raises once more, upon the casting call, instead of bowing, the fluteplayer steps forward. "We have suffered a loss, among our fellows. Known as Zaranda around the city, and even in Waterdeep, her end was met, to sad circumstances. We say goodbye to you, Zaranda." A small hymm is taken up, amid the actors on stage, before they somberly leave, to a quiet house.

Tamlin leans over. "Generally, after a tragety, all the cast get on stage and do a jig, to show it was all an act. The director's cheerful humor. This... is different."

Kyrel nods. "They've had a real tragedy."

Thorvald rises, and hastily walks towards the exit. Shamnur rises, slowly, and follows him, stone faced.

Kyrel stands to follow, offering his arm to Anya.

Rosalie waits for Tamlin to rise.

The nobleman rises. Anya seems to be a little at ease, but she does take the offered arm, with a smile.

Rosalie smiles, following Tamlin up. "That was a ... a fascinating play."

Derleth offers his own arm to Sil, looking thoughtful after the play's end...and at the departing Foxmantles.

"Certainly mood setting," He adds. Silniya rises, and leans over to offer Derleth a single-armed hug, despite the armor.

Rosalie turns to Tamlin. "I wonder ... did Zaranda have a favoured instrument?"

Derleth blinks, but hugs back, smiling happily at the offered affection. He has a thought then...but is reluctant to reveal it in front of Anya and Tamlin.

A shrug of his shoulders. "Her voice," Anya speaks up. "She was a singer, at heart. Not too bad with a stringed instrument, though..." A small, wistful smile.

Derleth murmurs a pardon to Sil, and exits the box, looking around for Thorvald and Shamnur...

Considering the general round shape of the playhouse, and thus the hall, it's hard to tell if they're further down the hall. Not to mention the relative flow of people.

Derleth grumbles and makes his way through the crowd, trying to spot the couple...

After some looking, the cleric can spot Shamnur having a conversation with another lady of seemingly equal standing, on the first floor, a little past the stairwell.

Derleth makes his way towards Shamnur and the unrecognized woman, even as he scans around for Lord Foxmantle..trying to take up an unobtrusive position near the two women, if he does not spot the Lord....

After surveying the relatively flooded foyer, Derleth can't spot the Lord. However, if he happened to eavesdrope in on the conversation, it would be more formalities, idle chitchat. The discussion would appear to be directed at what is going on, what news about other families, an update due to her minor seclusion from the circle, during the house arrest.

Derleth sighs, quickly becoming unenamored with the topic of discussion...if he wanted to hear lords and ladies talk, he'd have stayed in Waterdeep. He starts making his way towards the door, to see if it's possible that the Lord might have left.

Several coaches are allready leaving, but a few, like the two that Derleth and everyone had ridden in, are still in waiting out front.

Rosalie, SIlniya, Kyrel and their dates casually make it down to the foyer, and spot Derleth loitering at the doorway, peering out among the slight crowd.

While Derleth is standing at the door, he does take notice of something. A little past the opening of the theatre, are a pair of persons in hooded cloaks. Perhaps it's just him, but the cleric could swear they're looking towards himself. One turns to the other, pointing at the row of carriages.

Derleth makes a pretense of getting out his pipe and filling it, wandering slightly closer, looking at the two secretly through his bushy eyebrows as his head is tilted downward...

The two step back against the wall, obviously torn between approaching the cleric and avoiding the crowds.

Anya spots someone, and pats Kyrel's arm. "If you'll excuse me, a friend of mine is over there, whom I havn't spoken too in a bit. I believe Derleth went that way?"

Derleth takes a chance then....lighting his pipe, he looks right up then, staring straight at the two men, to let them know he's seen them.

Kyrel says, "Go ahead, Anya. I'll wait here for you." He settles back to watch the crowd, wondering who Anya is going to speak with.

Rosalie ahems. "Shall I come with you, Anya? It's rather ... crowded."

She smiles, and nods, before starting. Turning to Rosalie, "Well... Why not?" A little gesture is given, for the woman to follow, before Anya starts through the throng. Tamlin takes up loitering beside Kyrel.

The taller of the two looks straight at Derleth, his face shadowed by his hood. He nods, once, but doesn't approach. The other, shorter figure, stands huddled up against the wall.

Rosalie follows Anya, her hands hanging loosely at her side.

The young noblewoman proceeds to introduce Rosalie to a friend of hers, a young lady of another house. "This is Inara," She offers, nodding to the dark haired woman, who gazes at Rosalie with a curious, though reserved fashion. "Good evening," She says, offering a courtsey.

Derleth absently wishes Kiri were about...he hesitates as the men react calmly towards him. Taking a puff from his pipe, he then makes his way towards the concealed fellows, tense like a coiled spring.

Rosalie curtseys in response. "A fair evening."

The taller of the two, seeing Derleth approach, straightens. As Derleth comes close enough, he tugs on the cleric's sleeve. "A moment, sir? Please? We beseech you ..."

"Mmhm." "I havn't seen you around," Inara comments to Anya, "How are things? I know Zarandra was a close friend of yours." "Oh, I'm... keeping through." She reaches over to offer Rose's hand a delicate squeeze. "I have help."

++Editor: Erase those "" in between; Inara said both those things.

Derleth takes a step backwards, away from the tugging hand, puffing on his pipe. "I tend to like to see the faces of those who beseech me." he says with apparent calm.

Silniya arrives beside Kyrel, rubbing her hands. "Now, where did Derleth get to?"

Kyrel looks around. "He was outside with his pipe a moment ago..." He waves in that general direction. "He hasn't gone far, I'm sure."

The man sighs, then pulls back his hood for only a moment. "We ... we mustn't be seen, sir. But we ... we need your help." Under the hood is a young man, barely bearded. His face is thin, and long, and there are dark bags under his eyes.

Derleth eyes the man assessingly. "Say on." he prompts, trying to look wise and poised.

Silniya nods her head. "Never did understand the allure of those pipes. Like inhaling a campfire."

Kyrel snorts. "They're not _that_ good. I've never seen the point either."

The young man shakes his head, pulling his hood forward again. "Not here, sir. We might be ...", he gulps, "we might be seen!"

Derleth sighs, pulling the pipe from his mouth. "Young ir, unless you can give me a good reason to come with you, I prefer to stand out in the open. I didn't get to where I am by being foolish, and making myself assassin-bait."

The younger man tugs on Derleth's sleeve. "Please, sir? We ... we mustn't be seen ..." The younger man obviously hasn't hit puberty yet, his voice is pitched softly but in a higher register.

Derleth makes a decision then. _I place my trust in you, Bright Lady, even if I play the part of a reckless fool._ He takes his flail from his belt, and motions into the alley with it. "If you insist. But you first. And if this is a trap, I'll be sure to keep you alive...so I can take my time with you later." he says urbanely, with a hint of steel.

The two people precede Derleth into the alley, the smaller almost hugging the taller. Once in the shadows, where the theatre crowds can't see them, the taller straightens up. "We ... " He pauses a moment, then tries again. "We thank you sir. We desperately need your help."

"So you keep saying," Derleth says dryly. "Care to be more specific?"

The man nods. "As a cleric, sir. You see ..." The younger person tugs on his arm and whispers something into his ear. He nods, and continues. "Our families are embroiled in a feud, sir. If we're seen ..."

Derleth arches an eyebrow, his interest piqued in spite of his irritation. "Say on..."

The young man shrugs. "If we're seen, they'll separate us. We've ... we've run away. But we beseech thee, sir, to marry us. Maria fears traveling with me unmarried will damage my reputation."

The short figure nods its head vigorously.

To say Derleth is flabbergasted would be an understatement. He's taken completely off guard. "Uh...I'm not certain I would be the best choice for this...I'm a Luckbringer...one of Lliara's eyes and fists....not a High Father. Would it not make more sense to go to the temple?"

The taller shakes his head. "We can't! We tried but ... her brothers ... we can't!" The smaller tugs on his arm, again whispering in his ear. "We would be honoured, sir, if a hero such as you were to marry us. Tonight. We sail on the morning tide."

Derleth's face and mouth twitches. "Ah....here? An alleyway is not the most appropriate place..." he murmurs, stalling for time as he tries to think...

The man shakes his head. "Maria was hoping you'd consent to marry us in a little shrine. It's discreet, and never locked."

Derleth purses his lips. "Where is the shrine?"

"It's a little Sunite shrine, by the Walls." The man's entire posture radiates hopefulness, and the shorter radiates joy.

Derleth hesitates, and then gestures urgently. "Go there, now. I will need some things...I will meet you there in one hour."

The shorter seems a-teem with delight, and murmurs to the taller. He nods. "I know," Turning back to Derleth, "This is one of Sune's holidays. The priest who cares for the Shrine is away, to celebration elsewhere. Maria feels it's fitting, wed on this day, there, but we would be honored to be wed by you."

The two stay close together, hurrying down the alleyway, after the taller assures Derleth that they'll be there in one hour exactly.

Derleth smiles kindly, feeling obscurely honored. "Then go, now, and do not stop for anything, young lovers! I will meet you there anon, where you shall become one!" _Bright Lady, did I just **say** that??_

The taller looks back, nodding decisively, and then the two disappear from sight.

Once he's sure they're away, he wanders back out of the alley. _Bright lady, please bless them...they will need all the luck they can get._ he starts looking around for the others, his pipe forgotten in his left hand as he slings his flail back into its hangar.

By now, the group has eventually migrated outside, onto the steps of the theatre.

Kyrel is just about to send Kiri to hunt for the missing cleric when he comes back out of the alley. "There you are. Have to take a leak?"

Derleth gives Kyrel this mysterious look. "Tamlin...might we commandeer your carriage for a small side trip?"

"Ah... certainly," He replies. A curious look takes the nobleman. "Whereto?"

Rosalie looks intrigued. "Yes, sir, whereto?"

Derleth coughs at the attention. "To the Lliaran temple...and from there, to the Sunite shrine where we first met you. I've been...ah...asked to wed two star-crossed lovers."

Anya gives a slight chuckle. "Well..." Tamlin nods his head. "I think that could be arranged, yes. Would you like us to attend? Or simply take our carriage to your business? My sister and I can be off..." The nobleman smiles towards Rosalie. "Even if I did care to say goodnight, at the Inn."

Rosalie smiles at Tamlin, and bows her head. "We shall surely meet again, sir, and make proper goodbyes."

Anya leans forward, then, and offers a light kiss to Kyrel's cheek. "Thank you for the evening, Kyrel," She offers, before drawing toward one of the carriages. "Goodnight to you, Rosalie," He prompts, before following his sister, but draws towards the coachman to the other.

Rosalie grins, blowing a light kiss to Tamlin. "A fair night!"

Derleth considers. "Actually, I would like you both present..in part because they are of noble birth, and deserve to have witnesses of the same stock. Plus...it would not hurt to have one of Sune's faithful present."

++Editor: Delete the two lines before Derleth's last comment.

"Two, actually," Anya offers forth, with a smile. "Well then, surely," Tamlin interjects. "Shall we be off, then?"

Only a short time was spent at the Lliaran House of Commerce, long enough for Derleth to get the needed literature, and recieve a few tips from an older priest, before the carriages make their procession to the place. Parking the rides a small distance away, the group heads forth. It would seem that Tamlin, followed by Anya slip into an unremarkable crack in the wall, but the young woman waves them to follow.

Rosalie slips into the crack, smiling in bemusement.

Kyrel smiles. "It's hidden quite well. Interesting place."

Derleth remembers this crack from last time. He still wears his armor, but instead of his surcoat, he has draped ceremonial robes over his breastplate, and carries the tools of the ceremoney in his arms.

The crack leads into a small garden, hidden within the large city wall. Roses, orchids, and a number of other flowers sit, seeming in bloom, shining in the moonlight. The statuette is there, in the center of a fountain, within the center of the garden. At the other end, the couple are there, cloaks removed. Maria waves, her golden hair sparkling in the light of Selune.

A cat brushes itself up against Rose's leg. However, the feline is odd, in that a pair of beautiful, spotted wings sprout from it's back. The tressym purrs, and paws at her shoes.

Derleth smiles benignly at the two excited lovers. "Take your places by your side, and we shall begin. I have brought my companions to witness your joining."

Rosalie grins, hunkering down to pat the little feller. Then she places a finger against her lip. "The priest has spoken, little one ..."

Maria smiles towards Anya and Tamlin, while her soon-to-bewed husband nods to the others. They heed to Derleth's instruction, however.

Derleth pours holy water into a small basin, directing the two to kneel. "Before Lliara's benevolent gaze, do I bring this man and this woman, whose love is so great, the would proclaim it before all, and become one." he begins there ceremony, after which he anoints both with the holy water.

The two youngsters turn to one another, their eyes glowing in the moonlight. They barely heed Derleth, wrapped as they are in their worship of one another.

Derleth stiffles a chuckle, and goes through the ceremony, waxing on not only the importance of love, but also in the importance of daring all in pursuit of it, and seeking Lliara's blessing to make such a union as this possible. For in seeking the love of another, there is risk, and there are few things more rewarding, if one must risk. Then he guides the two through the vows of love and commitment...

Vows they speak easily, turned to one another.

Silniya smiles, during the procession, watching Derleth more then the couple themselves.

Derleth smiles kindly. "Then I declare before these witnesses and before the Bright Lady , that Maria Urnaovskaya and Alexander Jerhain are united in holy matrimony." he proclaims. He gets an amused look in his eyes. "You, ah...may kiss the bride."

Alexander turns to his new bride, and brushes the hair off her forehead, before leaning down to kiss her lightly on the lips. She wraps her arms around his shoulders, pulling him close for a moment. Then they separate. Alexander speaks, formally, for the both of them. "We thank you, sir. We will treasure this moment always. But, I fear we must make haste, before the morning tide."

Derleth folds his hands together. "As you wish...I and my companions will escort you to the dock...and safety."

And with that, they depart. Alexander and Maria ride with Derleth and Silniya in a coach, while Rose, Anya, Tamlin and Kyrel head in the other. The docks are relatively deserted, some of the ships still have lights on, amid them. The carriages stop, before the _Sirene's Call_.

Derleth removes the robes while he has the opportunity. "That was one of the most interesting moment of my clerical career..." he comments wryly to Silniya as the two lovers exit first.

Looking out at the ship, Rosalie smiles, her cheeks a little warmer. Then she pulls her hood over her head, covering her hair and leaving her face in shadow. _Darn. It would be the Sirene's Call ..._

Silniya gazes intently unto Derleth. "Did you mean what you said?"

Derleth blinks, taken aback. "Uh...by what, exactly? About it being an interesting moment?"

The swordwoman makes an idle gesture. "The litany, during the ceremony."

The two newlyweds bounce out of the coach, Alexander carrying a small purse. Maria turns to Derleth, waiting politely for Silniya to pause. "Sir, we've a small gift for you, as our wedding priest." With that she bestows a small carefully wrapped box on him.

Derleth coughs nervously. "Well, I did have to relearn the ceremony...but if you're asking if I believe that love is worth any risk...then yes."

Silniya then smiles, nodding her head, and sits back satisfied.

Derleth blinks, taking the box in surprise. "Ah...that's really not necessary, my child...it would be wrong of me to accept a gift in the doing of my duty as Lliara's cleric."

Maria blushes. "I ... I made it myself. It's not much, but ... I hope you will have pleasure of it."

Derleth considers, and then nods. "I will accept it, then, in the spirit in which you intended." he thanks her.

Alexander looks at the ship. "Maria ... I believe we should hurry. The captain did warn us he would not, could not, wait."

Derleth nods. "Go, both of you. be happy in your union." he prompts them.

The two nod, and with a final bow and curtsey, walk to the gangplank. After they board, they wave again.

Rosalie sighs. _Young, foolish, love. I hope they brought funds._ She waves, her hood still pulled forward.

Derleth waves back, before drawing the curtain closed. "Young and foolish they are, perhaps, but I wish them well." He looks at the box, then, and decides to open it.

Inside, a single pure white lace bookmark lies nestled on dark green tissue paper. The bookmark, in the shape of a strawberry, or perhaps a spade, seems well fitted to lady Luck.

Kyrel has been looking at the ship. He murmurs, "Sirene's Call. That sounds familiar, doesn't it, Rosalie?"

Rosalie pulls back into the coach. "Vaguely, Kyrel. Vaguely. I do believe, though, that the night is getting old. Should we not retire soon?"

Kyrel chuckles. "I'm serious, actually. Do you think her captain is honest? Those kids didn't strike me as suspicious enough."

Rosalie raises one eyebrow, looking obliquely at Tamlin. "From the little I know of him, he seems honest."

Derleth tucks the bookmark into a pouch. "Awful sweet, they were..." He relaxes into the seat. "Not a bad way to end the day." He knocks on the wall of the coach, indicating the driver to take them home.

Tamlin looks at the woman curiously, but doesn't comment. "I'm sure he's trustworthy; Selegaunt doesn't harbor pirates."

Rosalie nods. "Indeed. I'm sure they'll be fine. Young, but fine ..."

The procession then proceeds home, Anya and Tamllin giving goodbyes to their company, before heading home. Everyone then gets ready for bed, and slips off. Though, the only thing to note would be Kyrel sleeping alone.

The morning is greeted with a good breakfast in the Inn's main room. Silniya glances to Rosalie. "So, back to the _Saucy Mermaid_ Again today?"

Rosalie nods ... "Yes. The good captain's sailed off into the sunset with our lovebirds, so perhaps this time we'll get a better bite." She drinks her coffee slowly. "Perhaps you should arrive before I do. If we arrive together again, that will look ... suspicious." She smiles. "And a lady like me doesn't like the early morning in any case."

Kyrel says, "Fair enough. Maybe this time you should wait for them to approach you... you dropped the code word yesterday enough times..."

Rosalie grins. "The fair captain approached me ... But today I'll have coin; I won't be desperate. I can sit by the fire and drink ..."

Silniya nods. "It'd be wise to try and avoid getting the wrong fish to take a nibble. Or find the man who we have to say it to."

Derleth seems in a rather good mood this morning. "Maybe we should consider different disguises, just in case...."

Rosalie awwwws. "I think my disguise just became better after yesterday, Derleth ... And now I can afford to discriminate in my customers. But perhaps ... perhaps it were better if you went in without me?"

Kyrel says, "Oh, your disguise is solid, Rosalie. No reason we can't go in under different shapes, though. We didn't do anything interesting yesterday."

Rosalie grins. "Right. I can tart up again, after I've had a nice long bath. I'll join you there around the noon hour?"

Silniya leans back in her seat. "Or, there is another way."

Derleth chuckles. "I was jsut referring to the rest of us...obviously, you're the one to watch, Rose."

Kyrel glances at Sil. "What do you have in mind?"

"Well, just to maybe ensure we're not going about it the wrong way, a step by the city's dungeon, to ask the rogues if there are any catches to the password? Rose wasn't approached, yesterday by our man."

Rosalie says, "Wouldn't Jamiltn be a better man to ask?"

Derleth says, "Likely...the trick is finding the boy."

Kyrel says, "Wouldn't trust anyone in the prison to change their story now... they gave it to us under duress in the first place. Unless you have a spell to compel them, Derleth?"

Silniya hms, "Or one to check their truth in it."

Derleth purses his lips. "I do have a spell to make them tell the truth in everything they say...but they'll know it's in effect. And it won't compel them to speak, only to tell the truth if they do."

Kyrel says, "So we ask them to confirm what they said yesterday, and if they don't.... we still have our answer."

"So, to the jail, then?"

Derleth nods, leaning back...and letting out a a small moan of pain as he does. "Ah yeah...the jail."

Rosalie turns to look at Derleth. "A long night?"

"Well, you know...not every night I do midnight marriages..." Derleth hedges. His face turns beet red, though, as he avoids the question.

Kiri chirrips at his mage, and Kyrel coughs, trying to suppress a smirk. "Be nice."

Silniya looks a little more concerned, toward Derleth, but she doesn't say anything.

Rosalie smiles at Silniya, and winks. "Perhaps tonight ... a massage?"

Derleth refuses to look at Silniya. "uhm...we were going to a jail, right?" he mumbles.

The swordwoman chuckles. "Would you care to give it to him? I have the coin." She grins goodnaturedly.

Kyrel clears his throat. "To the jail, I think."

Rosalie grins widely. "I'd be delighted; we'll have those kinks out of him in no time."

Derleth groans. _I want to die._

The Watch's Dungeon is associated right near the center of town. As the four approach the front door, the pair of Watchmen stand up straight. "Your business?" One calls.

+++Editor: Make that three.

Derleth is more composed now that he's not being ribbed anymore. "We desire to speak with some of your...hmmm...tenants."

"Ah." He nods, then moves to the door, opening it up. "Visiting hours end in two, sirs, lady. But, leave all your weapons and components at the front desk, please."

Kyrel nods. "Of course." _Or we can leave them with Silniya._

Silniya, as if reading Kyrel's mind, opts to stand by them instead. Still, the two are reduced to a search by a Watch Wizard, briefly questioned about items, while quickly patted down. After that, they're lead down a stairwell, toward the 'short stay' cells. Several knaves are inside, including those whom they ran in, the day before.

After they're showed to the cell, the guard walks back up the stairwell.

Derleth glances at Ky. "You do the questioning....once I cast the spell, you've got nine minutes. Keep in mind that you won't be able to lie either...or anyone else down here, for that matter." he murmurs quietly.

Several of the knaves look up, and groan in unison.

Kyrel gestures to the two thugs they'd been accosted by. "Just need to double-check something, boys. You mentioned Tessa yesterday. Is there anything you left out?"

Derleth weaves a hand about, casting the spell as Kyrel speaks, and there is a soft glow that falls briefly about the area...

Benny's leg seems relatively fine. The foul mouth looks up. "What'd you do wrong?"

Kyrel says, "I didn't say we did anything wrong. I'm asking if there was anything you left out. We don't want to give the correct password to be led into a trap, do we?"

"Well, no. But I gots to ask why you think you can just bounce your happy magical ass down there, and expect to walk out? You ran us in; what makes you think you'll leave, since you know, and he knows, you know where he is?"

Kyrel just smiles. "Because we're a lot smarter than you are. We're asking the questions." He looks over to Benny. "You're not going to say anything?"

The boy gives a dirty glare at Kyrel. "Did you ask the guy in the corner that looks like he's got a pegleg?"

Kyrel says, "That's the person to ask, then? Thank you."

Foul-mouth smirks. "Well, I did tell say the man in the corner."

"Is that all you wanted?"

Kyrel says, "For now. Thank you, gentlemen."

The party then leaves, and Derleth, Silniya and Kyrel arrive, after properly applying illusions, invisibilities, and so forth, not but three minutes before Rosalie.

Derleth walks up to the bar and gruffly orders an ale, diguised this time as an ill-favored human dockworker...one of the men that services ships in dock.

He's given the glass by the hard-worn youth behind the bar, rather quickly. The drunk is in his corner, as he was yesterday, this time looking either dazed, or asleep, in his spot.

Rosalie arrives later, making her way to an empty corner, and ordering gin and stew. She makes a more leisurely meal, projecting an aura of satisfaction, rather than desperation.

Kyrel follows Derleth, a minute or so behind him. He's again disguised as a sailor, but a different one than the day before. This time he's swarthy and wiry, apparently from the southern regions.

Derleth gets up from the bar with his drink, moving toward Rose...some how managing a leer as he comes up next to her, as if privately wanting to purchase her...services. "You want the man with the peg-leg, in the corner." he mutters in her ear.

Unseen, Silniya settles down into the chair next to Kyrel. Seeing as the three wanted to be there before Rose spent too much time, they skipped the prolongued application of makeup, for a quick spell.

Rosalie nods slightly, then shakes her head. "Nay! I'll not be wastin' my time the likes of you, after the captain!" She puts her drink down, and stands up. "But it's time ..." She walks to the one legged man, sitting down beside him. "A mutual acquaintance suggested I look you up."

"Nnuh?" A shake of his head, as he sits up a little more coherently. "Hehe. Who's my friend who said so? Nice man... Did he pay allready?" He stuts out a little laugh.

Rosalie shakes her head. "The mutual acquaintance's a lady, by the name of Tessa. Sent me to ya."

Those heavy lids of his seem to tighten, just a little bit. Behind the silly grin is a purposed eyeing, this time. "Gotta love that gal... She knows what's she's doing. So's, you want to go now?"

Derleth grumbles and moves back to the bar, mumbling obscenities as he keeps one eye on her.

Rosalie tilts her head sideways. "Where, old man?"

His smile is wide. "In the alley?"

Rosalie looks thoughtful for a moment, then sighs. "Very well. Although I always did love privacy more."

"We can find privacy, then! I know a good place," he says with a wider grin. Easing out of his chair, the man staggers with that peg leg, before he makes a short little walk to the door.

Rosalie follows the old man slowly, hands on hips.

As the man hobbles out, Derleth catches something interesting. At looking at the man's peg leg, a crucial, inspecting eye could notice the 'stump' looks a little... Thick. Eyes follow up to the man's loose coat, where a bulge follows behind him. After another quick eye, the cleric-in-guise realizes that it's actually a well-put trick; the peg leg is actually strapped to the man's knee, and the lower leg is roughly concealed.

Derleth notes the falsity with interest...he finishes his drink, and moves over by Kyrel...pretending to tie his boot.

The chair beside Kyrel lightly scrapes. Rose is lead outside, and around the side of the tavern. There's a narrow alley between the Tavern and another establishment. Peg-leg wobbles down it, before sticking his fingers between two boards, before pulling one sideways, which swings inward, before he pushes the other sideways, exposing a gab between able to be wriggled through. In the earth of the floor within is a dark hole. "Our little nest, love," He says with a leer.

Derleth tries to get Kyrel's attention. "Should one of us follow?" he whispers as he stands.

Kyrel murmurs back, "Your girlfriend's on it. I'll follow soon."

Rosalie smiles up at the one legged man. "How ... cozy."

Rosalie looks down the hole, wondering if she's expected to climb down it in this skirt ...

Derleth blushes faintly at the reference, but makes no comment: now is not the time. He finds a seat close by.

He smacks her on the backside. "In you go." Quieter, "Watch your step; the ground's about four feet down, but the rock's like a step, half way down."

Rosalie sighs, and carefully climbs into the hole, holding her skirts close.

_That whack is, someday, going to cost him ...._ But she continues downwards.

He holds the way open, letting what light can flood in, for Rose. The ground above her head gives a little scrape, but the cause is unseen. Once her feet touch ground, a rough, rocky tunnely slope heads down, sea-wards. The rock 'step' issues a slight tap, and there is a relative sound of voices, down the tunnel. Then pegleg shuts the planks, sending the hole into relative darkness. Though, there is light, down the tunnel. Outside, Pegleg just flops down in the narrow alleyway, and lays out, as if he were mugged, or passed out.

Rosalie looks around, carefully examining the planks above her before shrugging, and continuing on into the passage.

Rose recieves a slight touch on her shoulder, assuring her Silniya is there, before she begins downward. The tunnel looks natural, if not urged slightly by human hands. It curves slightly, while still heading down, infact turning tight enough to be akin to a spiral-staircase, with a three foot drop off included. But, beyond that dropoff, it opens near the top of a large cavern. Inside, fishnets, barrels, and crates are all about. Mast-canvas seems to cut one section of the room off, and in the far corner, as what seems to be a Bowsprit carved in the likeness of a sahugain, it's bulk pointing straight up into the air. At it's base, a 'throne' constructed from a hodgepodge of crates, and other framework. Off to the side, a dropoff empties right into the water. All around, the room is filled with men (and some women), looking in different states of intoxicated, gambling, and so forth. Not to mention a few that look close to the guise's profession.

++Editor: Not Bowsprit, the Figurehead.

Rosalie stands at the entrance to the room, waiting to be noticed.

And that she is. After a few moments, someone looks up. "Hey!" At that, everyone seems to jump to life. From Rose's position, she's near the ceiling of the cavern. A wooden stairwell leads down to the floor. No immediate exits, or people in high positions appear present, but amid the lantern-light and obvious ship-plunder, many of the knaves within take up some form of precation. One leans at the base of the stairs. "Whatcha want?"

Rosalie shrugs, tilting her head. "Not you, I'm guessin'. Ole Peg Leg sent me." She looks around, searching out a leader. Then she looks down at the stairwell, and takes a step or two down, testing the wood.

It creaks, but holds. "Then come on down, woman!" He calls out, to many a grinning agreement.

Rosalie grins, stepping slowly down the stairwell. Halfway down, she halts, grinning. Putting hand on hip, and throwing a saucy wink, she challenges the man who leans at the base of the stairs. "So who sits in the throne?"

"That would be me," Replies a firm voice from roughly beneath the staircase. Walking around, rose can see the relative mountain of a man. His blond hair is pulled back, to bare the flat, blockish features of his face. The wardrobe suggests that of a simple, common fisherman, poor-trimmed tunic, leggings, and dock sandles.

Rosalie says, "Well met, and a pleasure indeed." Stepping down to the cavern floor, Rosalie approaches the man, smiling widely. "Always a pleasure to meet the power," she pauses delicately, "the power _on_ the throne." She drops a curtsey. "Sally, at yer service."

"Right," the mountain replies, and walks to stand a good foot from Rose. "Well then, Sally," Head inclined, "What brings you here?"

Rosalie places one hand on hip, swaying it a little. "Rumour tells me you have work. Stories suggest you pay will. And tales tell of contracts you've garnered. Contracts that could use an _educated_ front."

He smiles, which could be akin to a shark's mirth. "Please, educate me about what you've heard, then, teacher."

Rosalie tilts her head sideways, then puts a hand to her lips while she thinks. "Well, there was a contract recently to kill a bard. A ... dockworker ... would hardly have breeched the lord's garden where it happened. And there was a truly silly attempted ambush." She tsk tsks. "Quite clumsy, really."

Avos waves his hand, in dismissiveness. "I didn't trust the fellows. It was my way of seeing if they were loyal, or up to being kept. The targets were formidable, and they waxed a lot of my boys a few months past."
