# Inizii 2002-09-09

Logfile from PLKyrel

The night goes by peacefully. It would seem that any wandering thing has steared clear of the area. That morning, first spells are set up, while breakfast is set up. The horses are cared for, and then preparing for the meeting with Sessis.

Derleth looks at the others. "We ready to call her?"

Rosalie nods sourly. "Sure. Ready as I'll ever be."

Kyrel nods. "I think so, yes."

Derleth finds the closest fir, and conjures a light atop it. "Wonder how long she'll be." he murmurs absently.

It would seem that everyone is watching more the fir tree, but most the faint sound of rustling leaves, the creak of a tree-branch, and subtle sound of the ground compacted rises from behind the four.

Rosalie whirls around, arrow nocked in her bow. "Where are you, Sessin? Come to play?"

Derleth groans. "Rose, greeting our erstwhile host with an arrow is not the way to get things off on a good start..."

Rosalie looks around intently. "Only if it is our host, Derleth. We've just sent up a nice fat _Come get us!_ flare ..."

Derleth hmmmms. "Point taken."

Kyrel turns at the sounds, trying to see what's approaching. "Still, it's not likely that anything she's not vouched for is this close right now."

Crouched at the base of a tree, one powerful arm still gripping a branch overhead, one could confuse the being there as some demonic ape. However, as it stands, that is dispelled. A minotaur. A... most interesting minotaur. Iron cups cap the tips of horns, dotting them with razor shards. Fur a midnight and thundercloud, however hidden beneath the clothing designed to hide amid the trees. An enormous cloak that ripples with the colors of the forest mutes itself as the hooved behemoth walks towards them, shouldering a bow that's taller then two of Derleth's hight. "Sessis isn't coming," He rumbles, walking casually forward, "But her directions I have."

Rosalie's eyes narrow, as she keeps the arrow pointed at the ground. "Oh?"

A poweful hand lifts, to pull the eye-patch from one eye, to rest between them, baring the fact that it has fully functioning of both optical windows. "Quite."

Silniya raises her eyebrow, but doesn't comment.

Derleth folds his arms. He's going to assume anyone in the pay of the dragon is of more than average intelligence. "Are you authorized to answer questions? Not about your mistress, surely...but about actions we might take in pursuit of her goal."

The minotaur's head cocks, regarding Derleth with sharp red eyes. "That would depend on what I know, and what I'm allowed. But yes."

Derleth nods. "Right, then. First, tell us where to find this tomb she spoke of."

Wordlessly he reaches into a sack at his waist, extracting a scrollcase, which he tosses to Derleth's feet. "Beware. There may be some resistance around the Crypt. Paticularly of wing-backs and dark-skinned menaces. But there's marks on there of possible ways to get past the brunt of them."

Kyrel listens. _Dark-skin would be the Drow, I suspect. What does he mean by a wingback?_

Derleth picks up the scroll case and hands it off to Kyrel to look, so he can keep his mind on what he's doing. "How far is the tomb from the camp of the drow that worship Eliastree?"

Rosalie unnocks the arrow, letting the bow dangle from one hand as she puts the other on a seductively tilted hip. "Tell me, sirrah; what manner of creature is a wingback? And should it affright me?" She smiles. _He may not be human, but he is ... **all** muscle ..._

Derleth blinks at Rose. _What is she...oh my...I wonder if she could actually manage it._ A blush escapes his cheeks.

The minotaur clucks his tongue. "Three days travel north of here is the crypt; that would put the Drow camp, from that position, four and a half days travel southeast." His head turns towards Rosalie, a smirk excaping. "It is Drox, Rosalie. And a Wing-back is a _Fey'ari_. They're rather feverent about keeping anyone out of that crypt. Though I would worry more for your pretty face, to them."

Rosalie ahs, smiling. "A pleasure to meet such a ... a fine specimen as you, Drox. Your muscles are ... they're ..." She pauses, speechless, and steps forward. "May I touch them?"

Kyrel just stares at Rosalie, his normal urbanity completely gone at this point.

"Corded," He supplies her an adjective. Those eyes narrow a moment at the woman, before, "After Sessis is pleased with you, I imagine the barriers between potential threats will be dissolved. Then, we'll see how well you spar."

Derleth clears his throat, trying to regain control of the conversation. "If we do not reveal the existence of your mistress to the drow, are we allowed to go there? We may need some items they can provide before going to the crypt."

Drox turns back to Derleth, his expression stormy. "I am not her," He admits. "Most like, she would want one of hers with you. You're as trusted as much as you can throw a halfling." This he admits with a toothy grin; a good sport, no doubt. "For protection's purposes, of course. The Eilistraeens have nothing on them to spesificly deal with the fiends and Drow, however."

"As for equipment," Drox adds, "What do you need?" Up lifting the sack, "It might have been provided."

Rosalie tilts her head, considering Drox carefully. "After Sessin is ... pleased? Ah, well." She sounds a little disappointed, then flips her mane of hair back. "Meanwhile, I suppose, I'll be sporting with these Feyari, you called them? Can you tell me more of them?"

Derleth smiles. "It was not them I was considering, sirrah. In that case, perhaps you'd care to accompany us there now? It might allow you to rest your bow arm by travelling with us as opposed to hopping from tree to tree and aiming one of those spears you call arrows at us." he says smoothly.

Kyrel murmurs, "Oh, surely they're only javelins, Derleth..."

"Demon elves," He confirms with a snort. "Like a succubi wrapped in a piddly elf form." A chuckle which is like thunder. "I would worry the Eilistraeens would be aware of me. They are acomplished archers; no need to make them believe further competition has a name and a form. I am too well trained to be some wandering beast. This would cause for consideration. Consideration not needed."

"And as for what I need...it will most likely not be in that sack, since I have yet to determine what it is yet." he adds enigmatically.

Derleth shrugs. "We have a short human, a half elf, a werewolf, and a half-dragon in our party. You're no stranger than any of us. You don't even have to speak. They'll likely assume you're with us."

Rosalie moves closer, intrigued by the sack. "perhaps, sir, you can tell us what the lady would offer? There might be ... be objects we had not considered." She licks her lips, slowly, sidling closer, and eyeing his bow longingly.

Derleth looks wry. "Clearly, Rose desires your company, Drox."

Coming closer, Rosalie sees the bow more clearly. Her eyes narrow momentarily, as she recognizes the material the bow is made of. Then she looks again at Drox. _A dragon bone bow, carried by the servant of a dragon? Something is amiss._ "You have an interesting bow, Drox. It serves you well?"

"Clearly," He agrees with a grinning snort. Into the sack dips one powerful hand, extracting an orb of quartzite the size of an apple. This he gives to Rose. "Call Sessis's name, and you will be able to speak to her. It shall only work once. I would advise this for after the items are scored." His head cants towards the bow, before nodding his head. "Indeed. An uppidy Green began entrenching here, many years ago. I was one of the fore who brought him down, for Sessis. A reward to compliment my power."

Rosalie ahs, nodding. "A ... a worthy weapon for a man such as yourself." Carefully putting the quartzite stone in her pouch, she looks again at the sack. _Pity I can't get my hands on that bow; even a green dragon deserves to sleep undisturbed. And if mother ever heard wind of this. Sigh. She's not big on dragon weapons._

Silniya steps forward, toward Drox. "Could we get any idea as to what it is we're going after?" Drox pauses. "A weapon that the Crypt's owners hid away. Something which the Fey'Ari and Drow would be happy to hold. This Sessis, nor the Forest, wants."

Kyrel says, "What sort of weapon? A sword, a bow, a staff? Something large, small?"

Derleth decides to adjourn for a moment. "Excuse me Drox," he says politely, murmuring something to Kyrel as he goes past the mage. "Ask any questions you have now. I'm going to find out what we'll need." He then sits aside and gets out blessed incense from his pouch. He grumbles for a momentm and then decides on using the garnet as his sacrifice to Lliara. He sits crosslegged, and chants the words of the prayer, calling on Lliara to reveal to him the focus needed to take them to Arborea...

"A..." He purses his thick lips. "I do not know. But whatever it is, it could tip the scale in this Forest, which doesn't need to be an option for anyone." His head jerks briefly, before staring off into space a moment. "Fuck."

Kyrel frowns and follows the minotaur's gaze. "What's wrong?"

Although Drox's eyes scrutinize Derleth, he seems distracted, and worried. He drops the sack. "A problem, Sessis needs me. In the sack is a blanket. Wrap the weapon in that blanket, and it will be transported to a safe place for us to deal with appropriately. As well, there is a potion of Protection which should guard from any vileness brought by the enemies you face, and two droughts of sufficiant healing. I must go."

Kyrel says, "Until later, then."

Rosalie picks up the sack, pulling out the potions. "Who should have these, Kyrel?"

Kyrel says, "Spread them around, I'd think, in case we're separated somehow. I've got some healing potions already. One for you and one for Silniya?"

It takes Derleth several moments, but the images begin to creep into his mind. A great Oak. I branch falls from it, to the ground. Each branch shorn short, a gold coin melted to mold over each. The only difference here is that near the end of a branch, one is twisted in a 'Y' formation. Derleth knows that the placement can be adjusted with the hardened coin's gold.

Silniya grins a little bit. "I'd appreciate one or two, yes; the last few times I've ended up with some vicious wounds."

Drox simply nods. "Fare the well. Contact Sessis in case of an emergency." With that, he begins to charge into the treeline, fast as a deer at full throttle, and by the way those trees are avoided, equally agile.

Rosalie grins at Silniya. "You and me both. Let's share, as shield sisters." With that, she slips one potion in her pouch. "And let us remember to ask Derleth what these are."

She gives a nod, before turning to Kyrel. "By the way, I had a request for an item I was hoping you might get for me."

Derleth blinks to himself as he slowly comes out of the trance he was in, and waves the smoke from the inscence away. _Hmm. Perhaps it's not so hard to get what we require..._ "Okay...let's find an oak, ladies and gents."

Kyrel looks back towards the women from his perusal of the surroundings, a trifle startled. "Oh? What sort of item? I'd be happy to help if I can do it... the least I could do for you after all the times you've kept me alive."

A nod from Silniya. "Right. I heard about these cloaks in Cormyr. They have a pocket on the interior, and when you put your hand inside of it, you're transported a brief distance. I was wondering if you could make that? I don't want to get seperated from any of you again, or be stuck in the thick of the fight, and can't retreat."

Kyrel says, "Hmm... a dimension door or teleport spell should do that, I think... I suspect I could manage it. Have to check on the literature."

Rosalie oooohs, looking at Silniya. "That would be an amazing cloak." She turns to Kyrel. "Next time it might be me, trapped on the horse. Could you make two?"

Kyrel chuckles. "If I can make one, I can make two. But not in the middle of the forest."

Derleth notes the others are distracted, and so goes off to look for an oak himself...

Silniya looks back at Derleth. "That shouldn't be too hard to find." A shake of her head. "Sessis certainly knows how to... choose her agents."

Rosalie hmmmms. "On second thought, Kyrel, could mine be a necklace?" She pats her cloak. "I'm rather fond of these. Mum made them just for me."

An oak is found, and a suitable branch is claimed, deleafed, and prepared. It certainly pains Derleth to melt down some coins, but it's all in the sake of Lliara and his friends. After things are prepared, set up, the group sets forth.

Derleth looks at the gold-lined stick proudly. it took him some time to figure out how to manage it. But a groove dug in the earth, the forked stick placed inside, and then the melted gold poured into the groove got the result he desired. He sticks it in his belt as he mounts Platinum. "The question we should ask now is this. Should we go to the Drow camp?"

Rosalie sighs. "Perhaps ... if we could go invisibly. I don't know. Perhaps if we sent only one ambassador?"

Kyrel says, "Do we need to at this point? We've got information, and Derleth thinks he's got his focus without borrowing one of their goldsmiths."

Silniya rubs her chin. "I also think it depends on what's in the ground, out there. If it's something to aid the Fey'Ari, or something that would hurt them, or harm Sessis and them together: paticularly something that's holy in nature."

Derleth looks at Rose meaningfully, as if to remind her they still might be being watched. "Yes, but there are other considerations. The first being that they're closer from where we are, rather than from the Tomb itself." Looking directly at Rose, he mouthes the word 'map'.

Derleth glances at Sil. "You think that time might be of the essence, you mean?"

Kyrel opens the scroll to check the directions. "Let's see..."

Silniya shrugs. "They may have information."

The map is more one of the area surrounding the Crypt. It would appear the Crypt's entrance is below ground. A mark or two of where possible traps lay, as well as a few possible ways to slip into the area of the Entrance unnoticed.

Rosalie raises an eyebrow at Derleth, and then turns to look at Kyrel. _I wonder if he could teleport the letter into their camp. We could write a note to go with it._ Sighing she looks back. She points at herself, grins, and then makes to hide in the trees beside the path.

Silniya licks her lips. "Derleth... could one of Lliara's proxies deliver the map?"

Derleth considers. "Actually, that's not a bad idea. It would make thigns easier. I don't know if there's actually any formal relations between clergy or the powers, however. But, I suppose that's the best thing to do. Never mind, Rose."

Silniya nods. "The only problem with going to see them now, I think, is the time difference. They're a half day's travel, and a half day's travel back would be more time passed that Sessis could get suspicious. She's expecting a contact from us."

Derleth nods. "Well, let's go see elf fiends, then." he says wryly.

Things have been rather uneventful, almost peaceful. Surprising, really. The crypt, according to the map and Drox, is another day ahead, yet on the trail, Silniya stops dead.

Derleth pulls Platinum to a stop, since he was fondly watching the way the wind blows Sil's hair about when she halted. "What?" he whispers.

Rosalie pulls up her horse, after noticing Silniya's and Derleth's halts. Staring into the greenery, she looks around intently, an arrow nocked on her bow.

Silniya slides silently off her horse and moves onto the side of the trail, to a bush which looks like it's mid winter. The leaves are mush at the brown grass around the bush's roots. The branches are twisted. Silniya begins digging at the roots, hurriedly. That is before her form ripples, a growl ripped from her throat, before the werewoman's nose drops to inhale along the ground.

Derleth looks totally perplexed, both by Sil's behavior, and the bush that's out of season.

She stands up, and unsheaths her swords. Voice shakey, sharp. "Okay, I want everyone on full alert. Some sort of magical and profane detection would be advised. We need to move, _Now_. And quietly."

Rosalie looks back, and nods, then points at the trees, and mouths 'hide'?

Derleth blinks. "Why? because there's a bush with frost on it? I've heard of stranger things in the high Forest. One veteran told me about the time it rained blood for a week."

Silniya shakes her head to Rose. "I want to move, and quick." She simply looks at Derleth. Even in the animalic, graceful shape of her head, the emotions are worn in obvious colors: fear and worry. The shorter blade is put away, as she approaches her horse. It shys away from the glove that had dug into the earth. Silniya shhss it with some growling, her beastial face nudging with the mare's, before mounting up.

Rosalie nods, encouraging her horse into motions once more. As she rides forward, she chants quietly under her breath, and then sweeps from side to side, watching for signs of magic.

Kyrel starts to prepare, then stops as Rosalie does it first. _I'll wait until hers wears off. Keep the spells going as much as possible..._

Kyrel says, "What did you smell, Silniya? Basilisk? Or a cockatrice, maybe?"

She doesn't respond, seeming almost shaken. And they ride. Silniya let's loose a mournful gasp, just as Rosalie's senses pick up a big field of greyish magical aura. Derleth and Kyrel can see it, first. A tree, looking dessicated. And then they notice some more, as they approach. Silniya spurs her horse faster.

Derleth doesn't understand, but snaps Platinum's reigns to match Silniya's speed...

Rosalie looks at the trees, and spurs her horse on, one hand on the reins and the other holding an arrow nocked. _I don't like this. I don't like this at all. So much for Drox's useful warnings ..._

They come upon it. A grove that looks more akin to a necromancer's garden then belonging in a forest. As if something had blasted the area into death, pure and simple. The ground is greyed, blackened and brown. The trees are skeletal in their lifeless state, the leaves gone. In one tree, a bird nest can be spotted... and the rotting remnants of the enhabitants. Near one side is a pond, the water putrid and near oilly in composition. Silniya simply leaps from her horse.

Upon the ground, near the pool is a fallen form.

Rosalie slides from her horse, too, tying the reins to the horse's saddle so the creature has the freedom to run away if pursued. Then, her bow at the ready, Rosalie moves to stand next to Silniya. She looks at the fallen form.

Derleth blinks in shock. "Beshaba's breasts..." he swears, pulling Platinum to a halt and vaulting off.

The horses seem to Not Like this place. They jitter and shy away, Platinum seeming to be hesitant to approach.

Kyrel dismounts before he gets too close. "Easy, Maya. Easy..." He calms his mount for a minute before he approaches the boundary of death. "What _is_ this?"

Derleth knees by the body, checking it for signs of life, not concerned with his surroundings for the moment.

Silniya is visibly shaking. She rolls over the once live form. Angular features on a short, willowy body. Hair that was once full and vibrant is in threads, a ghastly wreathe about the head. Garments of moss, vegitation and nothingness are melted from the corpse that appears as very well drained as the grove. And very well it should be. Several moments of scrutiny find that the figure is infact a Dryad.

Kiri, having spent the trip on Kyrel's shoulder, squeaks and shakes his head.

The dryad's face contorted in the most horrid visage of pain one might find.

Derleth shakes his head. "What in the name of the gods of the earth could have done this..."

Rosalie says, "What are the proper burial rites, Silniya?" After looking briefly at the falling dryad, her eyes circle the grove, looking for the monsters that did this.

Derleth's eyes tighten up in anger. "I'm tired of burying people." he pronounces, closing the eyes of the drained forest sprite.

Silniya's form melts back into human, as tears begin to well in her eyes. "Not here," Whispers she in a hoarse voice. Rising up, the woman staggers toward the putrid water, before falling to her knees in front of it, hands bracing her head. "They've come," She murmurs.

Everyone but Silniya sees it. The waters of the pool ripple, a moment, even seem to surge up, before the sight of bleached bone beneath... and then the water explodes. They melt back as it lunges forward. Like some wraith of a water elemental, the thing looks like a skeleton, the bones of some giant or troll worn with age. However, surrounding the bones is some 'flesh', more akin to the water around it, some force keeping the fluid clinging to bone like viscous oil. Claws of polluted bone sink into Silniya, on shoulder and arm, skin breached beneath it, before the liquid-cloaked maw jerks forward to bite. Thankfully not into her face, but a grevious pain into the other shoulder.

Kyrel swears as the creature breaches the surface, but he's not fast enough to strike before it attacks the werewolf. His attack streaks in a moment too late, the overpowered magical bolts sinking into the thing.

Derleth's eyes go wide. "Siiiil!" he cries out, his mind fumbling for the first spell that comes to him....

The blasts of magic strike through the surface of watery flesh, sending quivers of pain rippling through watery exoskeleton. An unnatural howl excapes it, head lifting to allow those empty eyesockets to glare at Kyrel, blood swirling in it's watery maw.

Silniya, at first surprised and screaming in pain, is soon shrieking in raw fury and hatred. That longsword in hand is taken in both hands, swept up in a powerful upper stroke, taking It by surprise and cleaving through water and bone alike. Her second swing is clumsy, arm wounded and it now on the defensive, Silniya simply rolls backwards, coming to a crouch.

Derleth looks relieved as Silniya gets free. "Suck holy light, you dead thing." he spits, chanting words of power...and then thrusts out a palm, an angry golden ray spearing forth...

The ray of holy blessing blares in, hitting the watery flesh wiht a horrid steam and splash. The light streaks through it's hide, boiling it as the bones begin to dissolve, it clawing at the ground like a felled lion. The backbone snaps, two halves fall to the ground, one into the water, the other on land. Upon it's strike, the putrid, liquid exterior splashes outward like a popped bladder.

Silniya's not done, however. Boot, sword, anything is taken to the remnants of the thing, shattering bone and spreading what once was moving around.

Derleth blinks, but does not question his ood fortune that his spell finished it off. "What was that thing?" he asks as Sil sets about her grim task.

Rosalie moves forward into Silniya's line of sight. "Sil; why don't you let Derleth tape you up. I'll scatter the bones." Which she does, putting boot to bone.

Swordpoint shatters that stained skull, boot grinding down the fragments into yielding, diseased earth earth. She simply looks up, bloody, at Rose. "Get Sessis on that crystal." Throwing her blade down, she walks to Derleth.

Kyrel says, "Might be better to burn them than scatter them. What _was_ that thing?"

Derleth firmly seats Sil on her knees when she comes close, so he can examine her wounds, trying to determine if the thing poisoned her with a minor orison...

"A crime against nature," Silniya answers with as much venom as a cobra.

Rosalie pulls out the crystal, and moves back to stand with Silniya. She holds it out, waiting until Derleth has finished, or until Silniya decides to activate it immediately.

The orison finds she is infact not contaminated, though the wounds look to have breached even her defenses, normally reserved for silver or enchanted steel.

Derleth does not offer further conversation, only chanting to Lliara and calling forth her healing power to him, his glowing gauntlets laid on her open wounds...

Lliara's magics clense the flesh of the wounds and pain, flesh knitting together, pushing foul water from her. She reaches forward, pulling Derleth against her in a hug.

Derleth enfolds his arms around her calmly, kissing her forehead. "There, there..." he soothes.

The woman is shaking in his grip. "A Defiler has come..."

Derleth blinks. "Defiler?" he inquires, trying to remember if he's heard the term before...

Through a sob, "Rose, Sessis..."

Rosalie holds up the crystal, and calls out Sessis's name. "Sessis! We have news for you!"

Derleth just holds his love, since he can think of nothnig else to do, now...

A pulse of power surges through Rosalie's hands, the sphere growing foggy in it's interior. They part, baring the emotion-rich face of Sessis. "Rosalie?" She croaks.

Silniya pulls away briefly from Derleth, lifting her hand toward the Crystal, open to Rose.

Rosalie holds the crystal out to Silniya, so that Sessis can see her. "Silniya has an urgent message for you."

Silniya simply takes the crystal, and waves it around the clearing. "Look," She hisses into the globe, "_Look_." Her attention shifts back to staring into the now ashen-faced elf's visage. "_Blight Magic_ has come to our forest."

Sessis responds weakly. "I know." Her eyes close, "And I'm doing everything in my power to stop them." "Them!?" Silniya cries.

Kyrel pivots sharply, looking back to Silniya. "Blight Magic? Are you _sure_?"

Silniya turns her head toward Kyrel. "It wasn't a Fireball that did this," She snaps.

Derleth looks completely blank. But he figures someone will explain in a moment.

"Three of them, from what I know," Sessis confirms. "We're joining the hunt," Silniya says firmly.

Craig says, "'pologies, I just appeated here..."

Kyrel nods. "Aye, I know.. I was hoping..." He notices the cleric's befuddled look. "Blight Magic is a means to power at the expense of sanity. It drains the life out of the world - literally - to power spells. It's evil incarnate..." He reconsiders. "No. Not evil. Even evil normally has more sense than to use it. This is pure insanity."

Rosalie turns to the crystal. "This weapon in the tombs; it will fight the blight?"

Derleth's brow creases. _Of course, things would have to get more complex, wouldn't they?_ . "Sounds lovely." he drawls wryly.

The elf in the crystal simply nods. It's a few moments before, "Silniya, I have everything, myself and every creature that holds any sway by me hunting them. Not to mention others who _aren't_." Sessis's eyes flick to Rosalie. "No, but it would be Very, Very bad if the Defilers got their hands on it."

Kyrel nods shortly, turning his attention to Sessis.

Rosalie nods, and sighs. "Are the Eilistraeen helping?"

"I don't know," Sessis admits. "I don't care. All I want is these spellcasters Dead, cremated, and their ashes sent to the Abyss in a bottle. I know the Wood elves will attempt to obliterate one of them if they come near. Why they're here, I don't know. But I ask, please head to to the Crypt. Not for me, but For the High Forest." Silniya closes her eyes.

Kyrel says, "Do you know where the Defilers are right now?"

Sessis shakes her head, sadness and anger waring for the main emotion.

Kyrel nods. "All right, then. If they know of the weapon, they may try for it. We'll try to beat them there. If they don't, we'll secure it and join the hunt." He looks at his companions. "Anything else?"

Derleth just shakes his head.

"For all I know," She goes on, "The Drow or the Fey'Ari may **aid the Defilers. So all the more reason. In the mean time, I will do all in my power to put them Down, and get a Disciple of Fell here."**

**Silniya's grip tightens on the crystal. "If it must." She turns to Kyrel. "I want to find them, and tear them apart, but..." She closes her eyes again.**

**Kyrel rests his hand on the werewolf's shoulder, gripping gently. "All in good time, Silniya." He turns back to the crystal, dropping into Elvish. "_May the stars guide your path, milady. Good hunting._"**

**Rosalie moves back to her horse. "All things being equal, I think we should get a move on."**

**"Trust me, Silniya," Sessis urges, "Every Druid, every entity tied to this land is screaming for blood like you. They will not go long." Silniya shakes her head. "I'm worried too about when they're finally confronted... The damage they could do..."**

**Derleth rubs his forehead. _Dammit. This could make things very sticky..._**

**Kyrel says, "Would be worse if they got hold of an Artifact. Rosalie is right. Let's move. Speed is of the essence."**

**"May the Forest Smile," Sessis replies in Elvish. "The crystal was only usable once. Dispose of it, or keep it if you like." Silniya swallows. "Do what you can, Sessis. Make it so." The quartzite grows dim.**

**Kyrel shrugs and stuffs it in the Bag. "Might make an interesting paperweight." He heads back toward the horses, Kiri spiralling up from his shoulder.**

**Silniya collects her weapon, and returns to her horse, ashen faced.**

**Derleth curses and kicks the dirt. "Fewmets." he swears.**

**Mounting up, she starts forward again. After several moments, "Blight Magic drains the very land of life, to apply power to spells. Some mages and pureblood spellcasters feed their magic through techniques, making it harder to resist, or hit in a wider area, go longer. Defilers don't need to do anything. They can warp a spell as they see fit, and do it by draining the land around them like a leech, polluting what they touch."**

**Derleth faces Sil. "And you're probably going to insist we stick around to fight them, aren't you." he replies.**

**Kyrel says, "If she doesn't, I certainly will. Even a half-blood elf can't stand by to see this sort of thing happen."**

**Rosalie nods at Kyrel. "I stand with you. First we help defeat the defilers. Then we can contemplate other plans. And it sounds as though the first thing we need to do is to keep a certain dangerous weapon away from the defilers."**

**Derleth shakes his head in frustration. "you're losing sight of the bigger picture, all of you. If we stay, that makes us beholden to Sessis. And that's a long-term danger."**

**She shakes her head. "It corrupts, dirties the wielder's mind. The more they use, the more they need to use it more, find it harder to let go. Like some addiction. It turns them mad, slowly destroys their body, until they eventually fall apart." She turns her head towards Derleth, sighing deeply. "I want to. Every essence of my soul hates them. They've come into my home, tearing it apart piece by piece, because of whatever reason, maybe sadistic glee, or some persuit of this very weapon we're after. I don't know. All I can hope is they are found before we reach them, because I will make them suffer."**

**Silniya stares at Derleth. "And you're losing sight of the picture. If we do not, there may not be a place for Sessin to Be."**

**Rosalie looks over her shoulder at Derleth. "And if we walk away? Can we live with ourselves?"**

**Kyrel shakes his head. "No. This takes precedence. We are not committing ourselves to anything more than assisting in dealing with a greater danger. Co-belligerents, if you will, not necessarily allies, let alone vassals. After the Defilers have been dealt with, we can decide what to do with the weapon."**

**Derleth says, "If we were the only ones, we would not be having this conversation. But what can we do that a collection of druids, Elistraeen drow, wild elves, and a dragon cannot? "**

**Derleth says, "This is not Selegaunt, where the only forces that could be mustered is the city watch and a collection of Ilmaterians that the Talonites were all too prepared for."**

**Rosalie looks back to see how Silniya is taking Derleth's reasoning, and winces. "Some things are so ... so evil, that no good man will pass them by."**

**Derleth says, "Besides, Kyrel...if we stay, then we remain within Sessis's realm of influence, and we may no longer havea choice."**

**"Derleth," Silniya says slowly, "Let us say you have a hand full of dice, which you roll. You are looking to hit a certain number. Will you have more of a chance to hit that number with four more dice, or four less?"**

**Kyrel says, "And the more who search for them, the quicker we find them and stop them. We save more of the forest. We can use our escape any time we choose."**

**Derleth sighs. "Clearly, the rest of you are set in your resolve, so I will not attempt to gainsay you. But I feel all too sure that this particular good deed will not go unpunished."**

**Silniya is pained, it would seem. Infact, a bit of fire was seeping into her cheeks, but Derleth's response eases it back down. She just nods, and tursn her head toward the way.**

**The rest of the trip is successfully safe. The traces of a few beasts are sighted, but either they are avoiding the party, or preoccupied with the current Hunt. Landmarks on the map come into view, and they press forward, with the utmost caution. An entryway into the caverns beneath the earth are found.**

**Rosalie slides off her horse, and loosely ties the horse up. Then she moves forward to look intently at the entrance, searching for traps.**

**Rosalie finds that one spot in the hole isn't as strong. After some prodding, the earth cracks, yielding water beneath, and the sharp point of a stake jutting from the small hole's bottom.**

**Derleth keeps his distance from Sil for the time being...he's sure that she's dissapointed in him. But he feels he is right in his assertion that staying will result in the consequence he most fears: having another control his destiny. And he would not allow any to do that: not his father, not the Harpers, not anyone. But to keep the peace, he remains silent.**

**Rosalie steps around the trap, waving at it to alert the party. Chanting under her breath, she looks carefully for both magical and mundane traps as she moves forward.**

**No more magic appears in the entry, at the moment.**

**SIlniya questions, "Are we taking the horses in, or...?"**

**Rosalie moves slowly, and carefully into the entrance. After every step, she looks carefully. _We were warned of wards; where are they?_**

**Derleth dismounts. "It might be wise to leave them here."**

**Silniya frowns. "I don't know. Something, or someone may come by and dispatch of them."**

**Kyrel says, "I'd suggest letting them stay loose. Sil can track them afterward, and I don't want them trapped if something comes by."**

**Derleth nods. "That's probably best. if we take them inside, they could be in just as much danger. Plus, it's probably a narrower space."**

**Silniya gives a nod, at that, before turning to Rose, keeping hands on her weapons. Rosalie eases into the tunnel, which leads into a much more firmly built one beneath the ground, a natural cave system.**

**Derleth gives Platinum a sugar cube before slapping him on the rump, setting him loose, and then takes up the rear, motioneing Kyrel forward.**

**Rosalie turns back to Kyrel. "You have the map. Direct me?"**

**Kyrel follows Rosalie down, fumbling for his torch once he's inside. "Which way?" he muses as Derleth joins them, opening the map by the light of the mage-torch.**

**According to the map, there is a small underground stream that runs through three consecutive tunnels, the first just up ahead. There is a natural bridge which allows one to cross when the second tunnel is bisected. However, there is a small notation this would be a likely trapped area, or watched. A symbol is noted here, and on the other side of the map is scrolled that it would be advised to carefully swim up the small channel. Between the tunnels are holes melted in the ceiling of the stream's passage, allowing for air to be gotten, as is it scouted large enough for a human to fit through.**

**Derleth wrinkles his brow. "Strange."**

**Rosalie waits for directions, her back to Kyrel so as to keep her night vision, her eyes still searching for traps in the darkness. _Times like this is when I really appreciate mum's insistence on working in the darkness._**

**Kyrel nods. "Odd. Why so many notes, I wonder... unless the map was drawn up by the people who built the place..."**

**Derleth says, "Actually, I'm more wondering why an underground river has air holes."**

**Derleth says, "Unless they're just naturally made fissures..."**

**Silniya looks over it. "Unless Sessis was planning on striking this crypt, and had some scouts set this up for whoever went in."**

**Kyrel nods. "Or purposely installed... but that doesn't make a lot of sense. Why put weaknesses into a tomb deliberately?"**

**Kyrel nods. "Might as well. If the map is wrong and there are no airholes, we can let the current carry us back out."**

**Derleth chuckles wryly. "Good thing magic armor doesn't rust."**

**Rosalie nods. "Yeah." Moving forward slowly, Rosalie looks at the water, then slowly and carefully wades in.**

**It's cool, but nothing frigid. Certainly nothing that would cause Rose to blink. But it is wet. Silniya follows closely after. "Derleth, can you swim?"**

**As the current catches her, she sighs, backs out, and takes off her cloak, carefully stuffing it in her haversack. The bow disappears into her quiver, which in turn is slipped into the haversack. Then she turns back to the water, stepping in and slowly making her way upstream.**

**Derleth smiles wryly. "I can dog paddle...but that's about it. In armor, I can only sink. However, there's a way around that..." He murmurs a command word, and suddenly transforms into the Arctic fox.**

**Silniya chuckles quietly, reaching down to pet at the small cleric. "Shall we stuff you into Rosalie's pack too?" She teases, before looking towards Kyrel.**

**Kiri takes one look at the water and ducks into the pocket in his master's cloak. Kyrel puts as much of his gear as will fit inside the Bag, and steps into the water. "Hmm.. I wonder if the boots will work underwater?" He experiments, briefly.**

**Derleth wuffs, a little relaxed that she's joking with him. He paws at the water.**

**Actually, they do. The mage can be propelled through the water, although a littel slower. The water's current isn't too firm.**

**Derleth dives in and paddles for all his little paws are worth, shaking his head now and again as he follows.**

**Rosalie stops at the first tunnel, carefully looking around, before stepping into the tunnel and waiting for the others to catch up.**

**Silniya makes sure to pull Derleth along, when needed. One might crab-walk against the current, but it would certainly be slower. As they delve beneath the wall of the cavern, some groping confirms there are airholes. More like natural 'pockets', but the rocks feel melted or yielded upwards, by acid or magic no one knows.**

**Being close to the bank, Rosalie nearly jumps when a snake slithers past her along the ground. She had overlooked it until it was nearly upon the woman. But, it just wiggles it's tongue at her, before continuing to move.**

**Rosalie sighs. "Watch out for snakes, folks. No reason to kill the beasties." She looks up the tunnel. "Do we go in, or continue further upstream?"**

**Derleth barks. If he has an opinion, he can't share it.**

**Silniya lifts her head from the water, before looking around. "I'd say upstream, myself."**

**Rosalie nods, and wades back in then. "Hey, Derleth, one bark for alarms, two for a stop? And one for yes, two for no. No reason to keep you from voicing an opinion."**

**Sil cocks her brow. "So one bark means two things, and two barks means two things?"**

**Kyrel says, "Yes and no when we ask him questions, Sil. Stop and warning if he's volunteering something."**

**Derleth just grins foxishly, since he can't exactly nod.**

**Kyrel takes a moment to look at the map. Following the tunnel would actually get them to the third chamber, however is roundabout, and a notation points that there is a groove in the wall, no doubt a guard post.**

**Kyrel nods, and whispers, "Let's keep following the stream. It's safer - the guard posts aren't particularly close to it. Doesn't mean there won't be moving patrols, so keep your eyes open."**

**Rosalie doesn't find any immediate defenses, although some taletell signs of a trap on the bridge, a ledge connected to the wall.**

**Rosalie quietly wades to the ledge bridge, and after some scrutiny, attempts to disable it. Her fingers wiggle under a small pressure plate, which no doubt would drop the rocks holding the ledge, depositing whoever stands on into the water. A second element is some glyphs, which although she doesn't identify, don't appear very friendly. With some working, the stones the symbols rest on are pried up, dispelling the ward itself.**

**Rosalie turns back to look at Kyrel and points up the tunnel, a questioning look on her face.**

**Kyrel points upstream, then holds up one finger.**

**Rosalie nods, wading back into the water, and carefully swimming upstream, making as little noise as possible. _I just hope we haven't left anyone behind us and the exit ..._**

**Rosalie moves beneath the water, and resurfaces. And finds herself staring up at a foot tall little... Thing. It has wings, a big fanged mouth, and horns much akin to a bull, curcing down the sides of it's head and rimming the fanged maw. The little figure has a squirming rat by the tail, perched above the water about four feet up. "Huh?"**

**Rosalie smiles winsomely, showing as few pointy sharp teeth as possible. "Hello. How are you?"**

**He comes to the edge, staring down at Rosalie, wagging the rat at her. "I'm supposed to be watching for intruders like you." Dropping the rodent at her, to the air the little demon goes, flying toward the guardpost.**

**He tosses down, "And, I'm just peachy!"**

**Rosalie sighs. "Excuse me! Ummm! Could we talk this over rationally?"**

**The little demon smiles... and offers several rude gestures to the woman, before turning around toward the guardpost again.**

**Rosalie calls out. "Last chance! I don't want to hurt you!"**

**He turns around, putting hands on his hips, tipping his spikey head. "And just what're you going to do, hm? Breath fire on me?"**

**Rosalie grins sideways. "Something like that. See, I'm sorry I startled you. I've still got your rat." She holds the dripping rat up.**

**Derleth comes up behind Rose, poking his head out of the water, blinking at the flying thing. He starts swimming towards the embankment, as he's a sitting duck as a fox...**

**The quasit crosses his eyes. "So you do. Hm." He waggles a finger at her. "And you're in here, for some nofarious deed. So what am I going to get for letting you by, huh?"**

**The little demon spots Derleth. "Oo..." A malevolent grin excapes him.**

**Rosalie smiles. "Well, the rat, of course. What else would you like?"**

**Derleth groans. _Fewmets._ He pulls himself out of the river hurriedly...**

**The little fiend starts to flap down toward the fox. "Ooh. I want this one too."**

**Rosalie moves to the embankment too, following Derleth. "Ummmm. That's my familiar; I can't give you him. But I have some excellent cheese. And I still have a few apples left ..."**

**_Don't transform now, Derleth. Stay a fox. Dammit. Lemme get him in range._ Rosalie looks worriedly at the little fox.**

**The fox looks at Rose as if she's mad.**

**The little watchman puts hands on his hips again. "I want something to torture. Maybe I should just play around with your pretty eyes?" He starts to fly towards her, holding up a talon, which drips viscous black ooze. "Or you got something nicer, hm? Apples? Cheese? Pshaw."**

**Rosalie steps onto the embankment, and smiles. "If I play with you, will you let me pass?"**

**He cants his head, then snickers. "Suure."**

**The fox tries to pad out of sight of the quasit...**

**And by this point, Silniya sumberges. And that certainly turns the Quasit's head. "What the-"**

**Derleth transforms back into a human, and nocks one of the blessed bolts into his crossbow...**

**Rosalie smiles again. "Well, come get me then." As the Quasit is distracted, she snaps her fingers for her short sword, and stabs at it.**

**Kyrel emerges beside Silniya, blinking water out of his eyes. _Now what?_**

**Rosalie's jab nearly takes it's head off, before the thing ducks, squeaking like a mouse, wings fluttering.**

**Derleth aims as the imp ducks...and lets fly.**

**The bolt streaks in and hits the Quasit square in the chest. "OW! It burns! It burns! Helphelphelp! INTRUDERS!" It flails and squeals around the arrow.**

**Derleth doesn't take the time to quip, sliding another blessed bolt into place, aiming, and pulling the trigger...**

**This one, due to the Quasit's squirming, earns a dodge that saves it. Pulling the arrow free, it hisses at Derleth, before dissolving into the air. Silniya pulls her swords, approaching the guardpoint. "They're alerted. I suggest we haul ass to this crypt, so we can hopefully lock the door on whoever's coming down on us."**

**Kyrel points up the hallway. "This way, then. Let's not run into any traps, though."**

**Derleth says, "I'll second that...."**

**Rosalie nods, leading the way, eyes still peeled for traps. She's not running, but she is walking as fast as she dares. "Silniya: will you watch our backtrail?"**

**Derleth slides a new blessed bold into place and moves up beside Kyrel.**

**Kyrel extracts Kiri from his hidden pocket. "High Sentry. We're done swimming for now."**

**There's some grunts from the guardpost, but no one immediately comes around. The group move fast. Kiri squeaks several times.**

**"Aw hell, a bat," Chirps a comment from thin air, a quasit commentary.. Bat wings start flapping.**

**Derleth blinks. "Imps are afraid of bats?"**

**Derleth waves his crossbow around, trying to find the speaker...**

**Kyrel grins nastily. "No, but bats can _see_ them while they're invisible." He links his mind to his familiar's. "Where is he?"**

**Kiri squeaks back.**

**The gout of flame spurns forth, across the air. The Quasit lets out a squeal. Kiri chirps a confirmation the quasit's on the ground, not moving.**

**Kyrel mutters the arcane words, swinging his hands to cover high and left, then releases a wash of flame in the quasit's direction. "Thanks, Kiri."**
