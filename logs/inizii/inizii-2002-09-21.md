Kyrel, Derleth and Rosaline stand across the street from 33 Silver Street. Therein is a respectable, if not fancy looking two story townhouse, owned by, as the note to Rosaline informed, Malvolio Frenulric. This night was chosen, for the fact that a party in the other side of the Upperclass quarter had drawn Malvolio elsewhere. The lights within are turned off, the street is relatively quiet. Unfortunately, this night happened to be right about the Full Moon, having left them without Silniya's steady blades and watchful eyes.

Kyrel says, "So. Are we sure this is the right place? I'd hate to hit the wrong wizard's house."

Rosalie stands in the shadows, surveying the house. "The boy seemed quite certain, and he did have a personal stake in it ..." She looks down the street. "I don't fancy a frontal assault, though."

Derleth sighs. He understands that Sil needs her time alone, but it only more keenly highlightsthe distance that exists between them, even now. He refocuses his mind, trying not to itch at his ears. Since illusionary disguises can easily be seen through by a mage, he used his disguise kit to make him look like a moon elf, and dyed his hair. "Surely not. That would be suicide."

Kyrel says, "True. Well, then, let's see...." He murmurs the cantrip to detect magic on the building, looking for wards and magical traps.

Kyrel doesn't see anything immediately... No, wait. A definet glow. On the placemat before the door.

Rosalie grins impishly at Derleth. "And Silniya would **not** approve if you lived so short a life, would she?" She turns to look at the house, speaking from the shadows. "Perhaps, Kyrel, I could prowl around a little?"

Kyrel says, "Okay - looks like nothing magical on the windows - the doorstep has something on it. I'd bet it's a Magic Mouth to announce visitors, but either way we don't want to deal with it. Let's find another way in."

Derleth smiles grimly. "Never mind that I'd not approve of having a short life either." His mind goes back to that strange dream he had recently, brooding. "I'll stay here and watche the street. I'm not an expert at slinking, so best only do it when I have to."

Hiding in the shadows, Rosalie slides down the street, alternately looking at the mansion and the people in the street. No point in nrunning into someone. She mumbles under her breath, and examines the house for tell tale auras ...

Rosalie moves toward the house, and avoids sight. Slipping between the townhouse and it's neighbor, eyes comb over the windows. Some glow with very minor hints of magic. As well, there's a small servant's door in the back, which also has the same signs as those windows.

_It's always the second story that they leave open ..._ Rosalie circles back to Derleth, sliding back into the original shadows. "As usual, we'll be wanting to go in by an upper story window. Any suggestions?"

Kyrel twitches an eyebrow at that. "As usual? You've done this often?"

Blithely ignoring Kyrel's question, Rosalie stares intently at the windows, teeth chewing on her lip. Then she pats her pouch and looks frustrated. _It's been too long; I've forgotten how to pack for these little ... jaunts._ Pulling out the rope, she sighs. "I've got rope, but that won't help the first one up.

Derleth grins. "Thought of that already...I asked my Lady for a spell that allows me to walk on air."

Kyrel grins and lifts quietly off the ground, his boots whirring gently. "And I've got these. We'll manage."

"Will it also allow you to disarm traps, Derleth?" Rosalie looks up at the windows again. "After all, even the youngest mage learns not to put **all** his faith in magic ...."

Derleth shrugs. "I can also cast it on you..."

Kyrel says, "Or I can take the rope up to the roof and tie it there. We'll get you up."

Rosalie nods at Derleth. "That would be ... good. How long will the flight last?"

Derleth shakes his head. "It's not like flight. You can't go straight up....you can acend only on a 45 degree diagonal. It's like walking up a hill. But it lasts for an hour and a half."

Rosalie nods again. "That sounds ideal. That would give me time to check several windows. I can always attempt to disarm traps, but better to avoid them altogether."

Rosalie smiles at Derleth. "Assuming, of course, that you would be willing to so empower me."

Derleth shrugs. "I'm here, aren't I? Why would I start being difficult now? Ready?"

Rosalie nods. "Any time."

Derleth tugs at his cuffs. "Now, observe, nothing up my sleeves..." he says faux-dramatically...

While waiting, Rosalie leans a little towards Kyrel. "Do you know, perchance, who Basel Indoulur is?"

Kyrel blinks. "Aye, I do. A dealer in rare and magical animals and other oddities. Why?"

Derleth lays hands on Rose, murmuring, "Lady's favor, make this one light, enough to reach the highest height...air as solid as the earth, to this power She gives birth...." His medallion glows, and then so does Rose...but there is no other obvious effect.

Rosalie shrugs. "Basel seems to be a prime customer. Or contact. I was just curious... " As she hears Derleth's invocation finish, she steps experimentally, rising a foot in the air.

Kyrel says, "We've dealt with him ourselves. Where'd you run across the name?"

Rosalie waves a hand. "Just around. After all; why go in blind when a little judicious snooping can be so informative?"

Kyrel grumbles as Rosalie rises into the air. "Could be more informative yourself, y'know..." He watches the woman walk up towards the upper story windows, then nods as he remembers something. "Kiri. High Sentry."

Kiri chirrups, and wings off into the night.

Rosalie slides along the walls, back into the alley. Then she carefully steps up while staying in the shadows as much as possible. Eyeing the windows, she heads for a small one on an upper story. _Big enough for the others. Let me check for traps._ Taking advantage of Derleth's magic, she examines the window critically, looking for traps, locks, and the like.

As Rose does this, she spots something from the corner of her eye; a little flash of color, along one of the recesses of a window, next door.

Rosalie makes notice of something. There's a split, in the top of the window sill, just above the spot where the window would lift. Equally, there's an indention along the part of the sill that, if one were to crawl through, no doubt they'd press down on when slipping inside.

Rosalie carefully notes the obvious traps, tut-tutting under her breath. She turns to look at the building next door, intrigued by the colour.

After spying into into the window, Rosalie notices a bird. It has beautiful plummage of yellow, though feathertips along the wings are orange. An almost lavender takes up a slight ticking near the head. It peers back at her, intently, and shuffles sideways on the sill across the alleyway.

Rosalie looks back just as intently at the bird, before winking slowly.

It fluffs it's wings, slightly.

Rosalie slowly slides closer, holding out a single hand.

The bird inclines it's head, at Rosalie, before flying forward. It's wings flatter before her, a dazzling color, while in the air. Instead of flying to her, it goes up, to perch on the raingutter of the building, peeping down at her.

Kiri flies back to Kyrel, chirping.

Rosalie smiles at the bird, tipping it a light salute, and then moves back to the first window. Pulling out a shimmy, she considers the trap carefully. _This will be ... interesting to disarm. The trap goes off if you raise the window, or lean on the sill._ Muttering under her breath, she digs out a second shimmy from her belt. _If I insert this **here** and ..._

Kyrel listens intently to his familiar. "You found a bat? Where?" He takes to the air himself, following where Kiri leads.

Rosalie finds that, actually, the trap will go off if pressure is pushed down onto the sill. After descerning that that is indeed a pressure plate, a few struts are driven into the side of it, propperly blocking. The bird offers, "Help help."

Rosalie turns to look again at the bird, her head tilted. "Will you help me, pretty bird?"

Kiri flies off, and leads Kyrel to a hole in the wall to a townhouse. He flies around it, chirping.

"You help me."

Rosalie grins. "How may I be of service, pretty thing?"

"Inside, inside."

The bird hops a little on the gutter.

Rosalie says, "Yes? Inside?" She leans forward, examining the window one last time before carefully sliding it open and peering into the room beyond. _I **like** this spell ..._

Kyrel peers into the hole. "You're sure there's a bat in there, Kiri?"

Nothing in the room glows with magic. However, Rosalie does notice something, when pulling her head back. The bird glows of a faint magic.

"Friends come, too?"

Kiri chirps a confirmation.

Rosalie nods at the bird. "What will we find inside?"

"Nimera."

Kyrel says, "Is he stuck? Or hurt, or something?"

Kiri chirps.

Rosalie says, "Nimera?"

The bird bobs it's head in confirmation.

Rosalie shakes her head. _Ask an open ended question ..._ She uncoils the rope, slowly lowering one end to dangle in front of Derleth. The other she wraps around her waist as she straddles the windowsill. "Who is Nimera, pretty bird? And what is your name?"

The bird hops on the gutter, inching down to watch Rosalie at a different angle. "Zoa."

Rosalie says, "Hello Zoa?" She jerks the rope, attractively dangling it in front of Derleth's nose. "Is Nimera your friend?"

Kyrel grins at Kiri. "Okay, so she's got a kit and she's found some nice bugs. But we're supposed to be guarding Rosalie. You can come back and chat with her later." He heads back toward their target house to see how far Rosalie has gotten with the windows.

Zoa bobs her head again. Though, the bird's head lifts, as Kyrel and Kiri approach. It shys away, back onto the roof.

Derleth grabs hold of the rope, instinctively testing it to make sure it holds..

Rosalie smiles. "Friends, Zoa." As she feels Derleth's tug, she begins to slowly pull it up.

Zoa flutters back ontot he gutter.

Derleth struggles to climb the wall with some effort. "What are you doing up there?" he whispers as Rose helps him up. "Playing cards?"

Rosalie says, "Zoa; these are my friends. I am Rose; these are Ky and Der. Ky's the flier."

"Ky is very small."

Rosalie shakes her head, grinning. "You mistake Ki for Ky, Zoa. Ky's the human."

Zoa bobs it's head.

Rosalie turns to help Der onto the windowsill. "Don't move; let me check the room. Do you see anything, Kyrel?"

Zoa flutters down, and perches on Rose's shoulder.

Derleth grunts, trying to get a good hand hold. "Don't take forever, please...I feel like a kitten dangling from a branch..."

Derleth blinks at the bird. "What, you have your own familiar now?"

Rosalie chuckles at the image, and admires Zoa for a moment. "Right; the moment of truth. She slips both legs over the sill, and lightly lowers herself onto the floor."

Kyrel says, "Nothing magical in there, except for your pretty friend." He looks curiously at the bird.

Zoa imparts, "Cats fall on their feet." One could **swear** that was a humorous tone in the bird's voice.

Rosalie moves forward, gazing intently into the gloom, after giving her eyes a moment to adjust.

Derleth looks sourly at Zoa, not batting an eyelash. "Great. Even the birds make fun of me."

Rosalie has crept into what looks to be a privy.

_A man who traps his privy ... is a lunatic._ Moving to the door, Rosalie carefully checks that for traps too.

It appears the bathroom door is not trapped.

As Rosalie checks the door, Zoa lowers it's head, peering at what the rogue is inspecting.

Kyrel floats into the room and takes a moment to cast a spell of Darkvision.

Kiri hides in Kyrel's cloak again.

Rosalie leans close to the door, listening intently.

Rose hears nothing. Zoa flutters, to perch on the woman's head, to get a better view of the door.

Derleth climbs up, tired of hanging from the sill...taking a moment to rest.

Rosalie turns back to the window, whispering an "All clear; mind the privy."

Derleth chuckles weakly. "Don't mind me....I'll just...hang back here a moment..."

Zoa imparts, "Bad, bad joke. Bad."

Rosalie grins at Zoa. "I agree. Bad joke, Derleth."

"Gogogogog. Nimera. Gogogo."

Rosalie carefully opens the door, looking out into the hallway ...

A dark hallway. Nothing really impressive.

Derleth mmmphs. _I ache. It's the reason people try not to climb in full armor._ He looks into the hole in the privy. "Man, you look just like I feel." he addresses the contents below, though spoken more to the others in the room with the corners of his mouth tilted up.

Rosalie steps into the hallway, sliding into the nearest shadow and waiting for the others to join her.

The hallway is short. It heads down toward a set of stairs, and spawns into three doors, spaced down it.

Kyrel says, "Shush."

Rosalie examines the stairs carefully. _Paranoiacs ... I remember being warned about them._

Kyrel peers down the hall, then whispers, "Exactly what are we going to do here?"

Rosalie points at the doors. "Go through each of them in turn? Where's Nimera, Zoa?"

Zoa ruffles her wings, in what could be called an avian shrug.

Derleth comes up behind Kyrel. "Maybe you can teleport the contents of his privy into his bed..." he murmurs...

Rosalie moves towards the nearest door. "For lack of a better target ..."

Rosalie tsk tsks. "Locked doors ... let me see if I can persuade them to open." Pulling out some slender pieces of metal, she leans over the lock.

Rosalie succeeds, quite well, quite quick.

Rosalie gestures at Kyrel and Derleth, summoning them closer. _I wonder what Derleth is using for light ..._

"Gogogogo. Inside."

Rosalie slowly slides the door open an inch, and then another inch, still listening intently.

And then, at Zoa's urging, Rose opens the door halfway and peers inside.

Rose, imparted with her vision able to negate shadow, finds that it's a bedroom. Though well furnished, it holds nothing of immediate value. Unless she'd like silky sheets and matching pillows.

Derleth is actually just keeping close to Ky, and feeling along the wall with his hands. Being the only one without darkvision, he doesn't want to give away the others with any light spells.

"Nimera? No Nimera."

Rosalie shakes her head at Kyrel, and closes the door again gently. "Shush Zoa; the servants might hear us." Moving down the hall, she examines the second door carefully.

Derleth grunts. "Anyone but me worried about chatty birds giving us away?"

Discerning the lack of a trap, Rosalie again gently unlocks the door. After listening intently for a few moments, she slowly opens the door. Beyond, a small foyer with two other exits. A rug on the floor, a lamp and chandelier ...

Rosalie steps back, turning to Kyrel. "The third door? Or the foyer?" she whispers.

Kiri chirps.

Kyrel says, "Might as well check the last -- what'd you hear, Kiri? Where?"

Kiri wiggles out of the spot, flapping to flutter in front of the door leading to the foyer.

Derleth grunts. "The bat have a thing for foyers?"

The bat chirrups.

Rosalie turns to Kyrel. "What did he hear, Ky?"

Derleth is mostly keeping very still. His armor's not as noisy as chainmail, or platemail, especially freshly oiled...but he does want to make sure not to be the squeaky wheel of the party.

Kyrel says, "No... he has a thing for bats. He says there's something in there that sounds sort of battish."

Rosalie nods, opening the foyer door again. "Odds are he keeps all his little captives in the same room. Shall we?"

"Gogogogogo," Zoa says quietly.

Derleth rolls his eyes. _Pushy bird._

Rosalie looks at the two closed doors in the foyer. "Which door, little bat?"

Kiri flutters back to Kyrel, chirping.

Kyrel says, "He doesn't hear it now. Why not ask the bird?"

Rosalie turns to Zoa. "Which door, Zoa?"

Another avian shrug. "Pick. Pick. That one." A talon points at one on the left side.

Rosalie moves closer to the left door. As before, she falls into the rhythm of checking for traps, and then picking the lock ...

Kiri squeaks! But, he squeaks as Rose steps into the room. Crossing to the door on the left, one of the candle-holders of the Chandelier strike out like a whip.

The chandelier's tendril smacks Rosalie in the back of the head, before trying to get a hold. This sends Zoa squaking and flapping wings, into the air.

Derleth boggles. _That's different. Fuck. Well, now we're in it..._

Zoa squaks! and flaps wings, before nearly wrapping itself in them. Moving toward the chandelier, the wings snap open, and a dazzling blast of blinding colors launch from the bird, washing over attacker and Rosalie.

Which has no effects on either.

Derleth blinks at the bird. "Talented bird." he comments to himself as he draws forth his wand of light, speaks the command word, and aims it in the direction of the chandelier...or whatever it is.

It lights up, glowing. A close inspection earns that it does have dangling things that look like glass. The tendril which is groping with Rosalie almost shines like brass, but it doesn't have quite a luster. The candle hasn't fallen off. A glance between the candle-holders, which are now whipping about, earns the glance of something clear looking, but undoubtably, Beak-like.

Kyrel says, "Most curious... and here I am without much in the way of offensive magic."

Kyrel mutters the words to the magic missile spell, aiming it at the strange creature. The green bolts flash out at the thing.

The bolts strike, and obliterate the thing. It actually falls off the ceiling, decorating the walls with splatter, before hitting the rug and pooling. The tentacles curl and writhe, before spreading. It would appear there's a clear membraine streatched between them, somewhat like that of a flying squirrel.

Derleth grimaces. "Yuck. And we just lost the element of surprise..."

As eyes drift over the creature, something is spotted: a symbol, that looks like a birthmark, or brand, along the thing's top. A circle, strutting from it a wing, a claw, a talon, a tail.

Kyrel says, "I feel sorry for the thing, really. I hated to do that."

Rosalie looks more intently at the creature. "It's been ... branded, I think." She rubs the back of her head. "Well, that was our first surprise."

Rosalie bends over, peering closer. "Funny; usually these creatures don't look like chandeliers. Stalactites, sure. Not chandeliers." She shrugs. "Generally inoffensive, though, if you don't walk right under 'em."

Rosalie mutters under her breath, apparently muttering some sort of cantrip as she surveys the foyer again.

Kyrel says, "Basel started with a darkmantle, and altered it a bit. It's the sort of thing he does. I'd rather we hadn't had to do that - it's not the creature's fault it's owned by a paranoid."

Rosalie gets the feeling there's some magic stuff behind the door to the right. As well as a slight glow to the door itself.

Derleth says, "Maybe we should get out of here...tht's sure to have woken someone up..."

"Gogogo! Nimera!"

Rosalie sighs. "Well, Zoa says left. And the Magical Mystery Tour says right ..." She moves to the right hand door, checking it intently for traps.

None, but it is locked.

From beyond, a barely heard, "Zoa?"

Rosalie pulls out her lock picks again, then turns back to her friends. "Are you ready? I'll pick it and open it; at least we'll have surprise."

Derleth sighs, pulling out his flail. "When you are."

The door unlocks. There's a slight fizzling sound, as the spell glow evaporates.

"Hello?" Comes from within.

Quickly unlocking the door, Rosalie opens it, her eyes straining to see what lies beyond.

What lies beyond is what could be a study, and 'workshop'. A desk, quite a few books on a shielf behind. Other shelves contain oddities; skulls of some... interesting creatures, a few bits of ancient looking potterywear, and so forth. On another side is a coat rack, housing a cloak, and a few things beneath it. In the corner adjacent to the door is a table, with a light afixed over it. A few scrolls set upon it. "Zoa?" "Nimera!" Zoa flies into the room, fluttering toward a cage in another corner, housing another bird.

"Zoa! You're here!" Zoa lands on the bird's cage, peeping down. The bird inside looks like a grey looking parakeete. 'Nimera' turns towards the others. "Hello... Who are you?"

Rosalie smiles ruefully. "Rose,at your service, Nimera."

"Well thank All the Gods on all the planes! For the love of them, Let Me out!"

Zoa moves along the cage's top. "I'm here! Brought them!" "Yes, yes you did," Coos Nimera. "Thank you, good girl!"

Rosalie moves forward, to examine the cage. Given his track record, it's probably both locked and trapped. She stops, midstride, arrested by Zoa's comment. "Brought us?"

Zoa bobs her head. "Found you outside. You came in not through the door. Thieves, you are. Now you let Nimera out?" "Please tell me you've a Dispel on hand," Minera questions.

Rosalie shakes her head. "Magic's not my strong suit. Is the cage trapped?"

Kyrel says, "She _has_ been giving us directions the whole time since we arrived. And yes, I do have a Dispel Magic on me."

Nimera's attention turns to Kyrel, and she bumps her head on the cage door. "Then I implore you, please? Oh very much! I do **not** want to be here when Malvolio gets back."

Kyrel says, "That makes five of us, then. Why are you in there, and who are you?"

"And, no, it's not trapped. Just open it."

Derleth says, "The mage isn't here? That's some good luck."

Still in the voice of a parakeet, "I am Nimera Tera Olintena."

Rosalie turns to Derleth. "Of course the mage isn't here. You don't beard a lion in its den **while it's in its den**. Honestly."

Kyrel snorts. "It's not good luck, it's planning. He's at a party, remember?"

Derleth eyes Rose. "And you knew this the whole time? Why didn't you tell me?"

Zoa flaps her wings. "Gogogogo."

Rosalie shrugs at Derleth. "I assumed you knew."

Kyrel says, "I assumed you were listening."

Rosalie undoes the latch on the cage.

Derleth looks abashed. "Ah... well...my fault, then."

Kyrel says, "So, this is a polymorph spell?"

Rosalie turns to the parakeet. "Well met, Nimera Tera Olintena. We have a ... a score to settle with the mage. One that would be amply settled if we could relieve him of a few of his ... valuables. Do you have any suggestions, beyond the freeing of yourself?"

Nimera flies out, happily, and flutters around, before landing on Kyrel's shoulder. "So, you're the fellow with the Dispel. I realize you don't wish to toss around spells like an apprentice, but it's been utterly **too** long since I've been able to wiggle my fingers, and eat something Tasty."

She turns her attention to Rose. "Take every last damn nail in this house."

Rosalie says, "I was hoping, ma'am, you could be a little more specific about which nails had disproportionate value ..."

Rosalie walks over to the table, as she waits for an answer. _The auras are practically incandescent here ..._

Kyrel says, "Would you like to fly out? Walking out might be tricky. You can wait for us outside if you want..."

There are a few scrolls there, surely. But what's sending a supernova of light to Rose's detect magic is what looks like... a puzzle piece, laying on the table. Or rather, it looks like... interesting. A painted, wooden carving that looks like a part of a continent, taken off of a globe.

Kyrel says, "...or we can try it here. Will Zoa need the treatment, too?"

Derleth blinks. "Why would we want to steal nails? Unless they were platinum nails..."

"Dear sir, I've been locked in a little cage for... I don't know **how** long. But I'd like to walk around, and if it's fine with you, help with whatever skullduggery you're doing. I have quite the score to settle."

Rosalie looks intrigued. Worried about the time, she scoops both the carving and the scrolls into a handy sack. They can be dissected at leisure later, in the inn. She turns to the desk ...

Zoa shakes her head from the cage. "No, Zoa's my familiar. A corollax."

The desk seems to have all the things that a wizard's might have. Books, papers, and oddly, a paper fan.

++Edit: Nimera said that.

Rosalie scoops up the paper fan immediately. After a few moment's consideration, she grabs the papers too. And any books that fit into the sack. _Pack first, sort later._ She checks the desk's drawers ...

The paper fan actually glows of magic.

Kyrel nods. "As you will, then." He cracks his knuckles, and gets ready to start the spell. "Let's see how powerful his spells are."

"Check those three fat books right close together, Rosalie. They're actually a secret compartment. My spellbook is in there, amid other things. Please get it." She immediately flies off of Kyrel's shoulder, to settle onto the ground before him.

Rosalie nods, checking the books carefully, and decanting everything she finds into her sack. As the sack fills, she thrusts it at Derleth. "Carry this?" And then she pulls out a second one.

Derleth chuckles. "I thought you loved me for my mind..." But he holds the sack.

Rosalie shrugs at Derleth. "If I loved you for your body, Silniya might be unhappy. And I like her. Now hush, unless you see anything I've missed ..." After giving the desk one last thorough ransacking, she moves to the shelves ...

Derleth just shakes his head with a smile. "Loot away, my dear..."

Kyrel's fingers move, letting the spell-disruption enchantment flow from him. There's a slight distortion of the air, then a full ripple of light-motes around the parakeet's body. A slight flash, and standing before him is a human-looking woman. Red hair is unkept and chaoticly tossed about, her healthy cheeks a little rosey from the change. Splended, if a little odd clothing takes up her presence; a dash of oranges and purples, greens and blues, leading down to a dashing pair of trousers, and the budice clinging to lithe form. She looks a little dizzy at the change, before holding her hands before her, looking utterly happy. Zoa flies to perch on the woman's shoulder, nuzzling her neck.

Kyrel begins chanting, and the magical energies flare in the dimly lit room. The counterspell creates a bright green glow around Nimera, crawling and sparking as if trying to find a way through chinks in the bird's skin. There is little success for a moment, and then Derleth murmurs a prayer to Lliara and the energies penetrate.

Kyrel says, "\*\*\*Edit: Reverse those two."

Books, books, and books. The items on the shelves aren't so much magical, but look... historical. Old, musty, with ancient tongues or etchings on them. The cloak, and other things over on the rack by the door Do glow of magic, however.

Derleth looks pleased, having contributed something of worth...

Rosalie turns to the rack, eyeing the cloack critically. She tosses it to Derleth. "If you'll carry this too." Then she puts the smaller items in the second sack.

"By the way, Nimera, where does the mage keep his spell books?" Rosalie tosses the question over her shoulder as she stuffs methodically.

Kyrel says, "Welcome back to the ranks of the Art. You're going to have to tell us what Mally had against you... we decided he needed a lesson after he nearly killed a young boy for picking his pocket."

A belt greets Rosalie's eyes, which glows of Transmutation magic, and a shield brooch, shaped in the form of a feather.

+++Editor: Cloak brooch.

Her lips purse. "Yes, that sounds Just like him." She turns, and places her hand on the cage that she inhabited. Chanting a few words, electricity surges through her hand, and into the cage, making it spark and smoke before a deep gash melts where her hand rests on. "There. No one will occupy that again."

"His spellbook is in the bottom drawer. Do tear that up."

Kyrel says, "How'd he do it, anyway? Cast a spell on you, or some kind of item?"

Rosalie oooohs, turning back to the desk. "Hey Ky? Want a new spell book? One previous owner ..."

Kyrel chuckles. "Bring it along, I'll take a look. He's not a nice person."

Turning back, she smiles towards Kyrel, walking closer. A kiss is bestowed onto his nose. "Thank you for dispelling that." "Good mage," Zoa imparts from Nimera's shoulder. "Yes, a spell. We... you could say were co-workers."

Rosalie nods, stuffing the spell book into the sack too.

Kyrel smiles at the kiss and twitches an eyebrow at the comment. "You could say that, but...?"

Derleth grunts. "Obviously, she no longer as a good working relationship with him."

Rosalie takes one last look around, then turns to face Nimera. "You look wonderful, ma'am. Shall we continue this conversation elsewhere? I can lower Der and you from the window."

Running fingers through her hair, "But I'm going to see him get disbarred, hopefully. We're part of a Guild associated with Selegaunt, Waterdeep, and Silverymoon. The Association of Old Exploration, Excivation, and Recovery. the A.O.E.E.R. Well, I and he met on a ruin exploration trip, he has a bird familiar as well, though a native parakeet." Zoa chirps, "Dim bird." "Yes, yes, he is," She says grudgingly. Kyrel could note that her left eye, a brown, changes color to a hazel. "Well, suffice to say, we eventually went to bed. And he got the impression that I was infatuated with him, and got a little... picky about it. And after a slight exchange of words... I'm a bird. And a followup spell that pretty much stunned me, and he caught me in a sack."

Kyrel grins lazily at Derleth. "Derleth, I could _say_ I was the Queen of the Elves, but that wouldn't make it so."

"Too handsome for a Queenish title," Nimera offers with a smirk. "Then again, elves usually are rather feminine?" She darts with the tease.

Kyrel says, "Well, my _mother_ was..."

Nimera turns a disgusted look towards the cage. "Being in that stuffy thing for a while, and enduring the boring, pompus conversationalist wasn't the worst thing."

Kyrel says, "What was, then?"

"His familiar is a bird with a beautiful voice, and isn't common in these parts. Their eggs are expensive." She grits her teeth. "He turned me into the brid's species."

Derleth groans. "I'm seriously starting to dislike this guy. You don't just polymorph someone because they lousy in bed...." He doesn't make the obvious joke about the mage managing to get her 'in the sack again'....

Rosalie halts, arrested by the thought. "Where are the eggs, ma'am? Can we rescue them, too?"

\*\*\*\*\*they/you're

"No, he did it because I wouldn't go again. I wasn't that masochistic a second time."

Derleth chuckles. "Well, that was my meaning...he can't blame you for his...deficiencies."

A shake of Nimera's head. "No, the last ones were sold." Zoa perches idly in Nimera's hair, peeping down at Kyrel, bobbing her head while shifting side to side.

Rosalie growls under her breath. "That will make it ... harder to return your children to you, ma'am. Please, shall we move on before the mage returns?"

Kyrel hisses a couple of his favorite Draconic curses. "We ought to leave a few presents for the son of a ..." He stops and looks apologetically at Derleth. "No, can't say that. Your lady love wouldn't approve."

A dismissive wave of her hands. "They're just eggs. Smarter, yes, then your common bird, but still..." She shakes her head. "It's no matter. I woudln't have Stayed that way, but he had siezed my spellbook, and I had no spells prepared that could be done without needing one's hands. So, I was pretty... featherstruck." The corners of her lips curve. Before brows raise, at Kyrel. "That's a ripe one. But I thought it was pronounced _Ra-Shla-Chra._" An idle wink.

Rosalie hmmmms. "I wonder, Kyrel ... don't most mages keep a second spell book, just in case?"

"Under his bed," Nimera answers.

Kyrel says, "If they can afford it, yes... no telling where he hides it, though."

++Edit: Switch those.

Rosalie ahs, grinning. "Didn't we just see a bed? Trapped, Nimera?"

Kyrel bows to Nimera. "I stand corrected. Shall we?"

IniziiGM says, "The one at the end of the hall is his bed room. The other is a guest room."

++Editor: You know what to do.

Rosalie nods to Nimera. Very well. If you will follow me, Derleth, we have a bedroom to ransack.

"This way." She leads, walking past the door, which opens before she even gets there. Patting it gently, a pause in the foyer. "Poor thing."

Rosalie follows Nimera, bemused.

Derleth chuckles. "Wonder what interesting things we'll find there..." he says as he follows.

Kyrel sighs. "I wouldn't have hit it with the spell if I'd known how fragile it was."

As if sensing the misfortune earlier, she peers over her shoulder. "It was hungry, probably, too." A shake of her head. "Blame Malvolio for it's perishness; it's a thiefward." The inchor puddle next to Nimera starts to ripple and swirl.

She steps over it, and slinks into the hallway.

Kyrel frowns at the activity. "That's unusual..."

Rosalie looks back longingly at the foyer ... "We never did check what was behind the other door ..."

Nimera pauses at the doorway. "Don't," She hisses. "False door. Trapped. Very bad."

"On the other hand ... maybe I don't need to know." Rosalie grins, following Nimera ...

The wizardess leads the way, before testing the door at the end of the hall, then opens it. A nod. "Yep. His bedroom."

Kyrel nods. "Paranoia. Of course, we're going to be reinforcing that streak in him. Too bad..."

Derleth hangs back with Kyrel, and the cleric nudges Kyrel. "She likes you." he murmurs quiet enough so the others can't hear.

Turning on her heel, to lean on the doorway, "Do any of you mind setting fire to this little claptrap of a nail's shell? After warning the downstairs men, of course..."

Kyrel grins at the cleric. "You think? I'm a rescuer. She'll get over it."

Kyrel says, "Hmm... the problem is that we don't have anything against his neighbors, and it might spread."

Kyrel says, "We just saved the whole city a few months ago, and I'm sure they wouldn't be pleased if we burned it down."

Rosalie steps into the bedroom, examining the furnishings. "Under the bed, you said? How ... unoriginal."

Derleth looks speculatively between Kyrel and Nimera. "Maybe....."

She purses her lips, at that. "Point. Damn." A cant of her head. "Really? Malvolio mentioned some hubub..." As Rose passes, Nimera taps her on the shoulder.

Rosalie pauses, turning to look at Nimera. "Yes?"

She reaches forward, to beep Rose's nose. Drawing her hand back, muttering something, it looks like the rogue's dainty sniffer is within the woman's hand. "Got your nose."

Kyrel snorts. "He could've been helpful, but apparently he couldn't be bothered."

Rosalie ummmms ... "Nimera?"

She opens her palm, baring the fact it's a digit so guised. "Sorry. I've been a little... starved for attention, so I am a touch cheesy, now. Malvolio has one of the Worst senses of humor."

Rosalie chuckles weakly. "Not a problem. Stay here for a moment? I'd like to check the bed for traps."

Derleth boggles. "Would a man trap his own bed?"

"Dear, the only trap you're going to find in there is the Dissatisfaction that anyone in there gets insnared with."

Kyrel says, "Depends how paranoid he is..."

Rosalie shrugs. "I hesitate to contradict you, ma'am, but the man trapped his **privy** window ..." But when the bed comes out clean, she leans underneath, to see if she can spot the spell book ...

A box beneath. "Yes, because Daddy is Rich, and he has an utter distaste to those who take things that aren't theirs. Or, rather, his." Dryly, "This coming from a tombrobber."

Rosalie shrugs, as she pulls out the box, carefully checking it, too, for traps ...

Kyrel says, "Well, it's not like people who've been buried still _need_ their stuff..."

Sitting back on her haunches, Rosalie carefully opens the box.

The wooden pattern in the door idly pulls towards towards Nimera, as she stands there. Eyeing Derleth a moment, "Who's your patron?"

Derleth blinks. "Lliara. Why?"

Rosalie mumbles under her breath again, calling upon her favourite little cantrip as she surveys the contents of the box ...

A shrug. "Curious?" She idly smooths her hand along the door, the patterns quitting. Zoa flutters over to inspect what Rose has found.

Nothing in the box glows of magic. Infact, there's just the spellbook.

Rosalie mutters under her breath about cheapskates, and glances around the room, her hands automatically stuffing the book into her sack.

Derleth chuckles. "I'm sorry, if you want a more verbose answer, for curiosity's sake, I'll happily provide. I just thought you wanted to know for some purposeful reason. After all, I'm just carrying the sacks..."

There's some expensive candles, it looks like.

Rosalie shrugs philosophically, and takes the candles ...

Rosalie turns back to Nimera, winking. "I wonder where he keeps his strongbox, with his coin ..."

Nimera stretches. "He has some rather fervelous artwork, and the like, downstairs. A few statues, paintings... I suggest we not go after that."

Rosalie shakes her head. "Too bulky, too hard to fence."

Kyrel says, "Oh? Traps, or magic, or inconvenience?"

"Strong box? Hm..." She scrunches her brow. "I think... yes... I think it's hidden behind the false door." She looks back to Kyrel. "Inconvenience. And I believe one of the statues is animated."

Rosalie sighs. "The trapped false door? How dangerous is that ... trap?"

"Not exceedingly lethal. It's more 'alert/alarm'.

Derleth says, "Meant to alert people in the house, or the caster of the trap?"

Kyrel says, "Hmmm. We really don't need to set off a bunch of alarms."

"The former."

Rosalie says, "I was deemed, by my mother, to be barely proficient at disabling traps. Nonetheless, ma'am, of you have need of coin, I could try it while the others wait in the alley ..."

Derleth says, "Yeah...but we also dont want the mage to come home early..."

She waves her hand. "My apartments should be still where they are. But, please pilfer all you care to, if you would?" Zoa flutters back to Nimera, and peeps.

Rosalie says, "Well gentlemen? We know there is a trap; perhaps I can at least look to see how difficult disabling it would be?"

"Gogogo?" Zoa asks. "In a minute." Nimera pets the bird, idly. "So, Rose, are you going to give it a shot?"

Derleth says, "I'm game."

A slow smile. "If need be, I can offer a distraction?"

Kyrel says, "What do you need to distract?"

Rosalie smiles. "Right. Let's go look." She retraces her steps to the foyer, and stops in front of the second door, looking at it intently ... "Let's see if I can find the trap?"

"Why, who the trap would alert, silly."

Rose finds the trap. It seems a combination; behind the door, her probing discovers a flask, that's attached to the wall. However, with some nudging, she finds it's equally attached to the door, with a hinge. Guessing that, when the door opens, the material will spill. Also, she finds a wire attached to the base of the door; no doubt an alarm.

Rosalie turns around. "Right; let's give this a shot, shall we? Everyone ready?"

Nimera takes a few steps back. Just... incase.

Rose removes a small blade from a pocket, and first slices the wire cleanly. Then, using that same blade, stabs it into the mechanism which would tip the flask of liquid.

Grinning proudly, Rosalie pulls the door open. "Ta-daaa ...

Kyrel says, "Amazing. A trapped closet."

Derleth says, "Well now. We're got the crackerjack trapsnapper with us..."

Kyrel says, "And she's a lot prettier than Regin, too."

Opening the door, the blade holds that container stuck. However, there is another flask further in, that Is tipped. It's contents, a reddish fluid, splashes on the ground, harmless. When the door does open, the blade stuck in the hinge doesn't allow that other flask, a yellow liquid therein, and with Rose's strenght, it breaks the lever that would tip it.

Eyeing the flasks in bemusement, Rosalie tsk tsks. "Rank amateurs." She eyes the strongbox, then decides simply to carry it under one arm. After all, she can put it down when lowering Derleth and Nimera. She turns back to face the others. "We should really get moving. I think, Nimera, we have every nail of true value in this manse. Are you satisfied?"

++Edit: Note rose finds the strongbox in a compartment behind the door.

"I would say pilfer his art, too, since he likes showing that off, but no time, no time." A smile. "Off with us?"

Rosalie nods. "Derleth, why don't you lead the way ..."

Derleth hefts the two sacks. "My pleasure..."

Kyrel says, "If we're all ready, then? Rosalie, if you could give me some of the heavy stuff to stash in my bag...?" A few moments later, with things stowed away properly, the mage smiles. "And now, for our dramatic departure. Kiri, if you please? And Nimera, if your familiar would stay with you for a moment?" He gathers the group in close and chants the spell. A moment later, after a fleeting glimpse of the silvery wasteland of the Astral Plane, they are standing outside the Halfway Inn. "And here we are...."

Rosalie looks around, grinning. "I'm hungry. Let's get supper in my room, and then we can examine everything in greater detail."

Nimera staggers, just a bit, Zoa clinging. "That always makes me dizzy..."

She looks up. "Oh! This place! They have the most **delicious** little mushrooms."

Kyrel says, "Among other things. C'mon in, we've got the shielded rooms. Expensive, but worth it."

IniziiGM says, "Okay, the scrolls are Legend Lore, Whispering Wind, Sending, Idenitfy."

IniziiGM says, "Nimera would inform you the Cloak is a cloak of Resistance. However, it also has an interesting thing: A permenant pocket called a Familiar Pocket. It's an extra-dimensional space that a familiar can crawl into, it has air, water, it gets 'sustenance' in there."

Kyrel says, "Is any of the stuff hers?"

IniziiGM says, "No, that's his."

IniziiGM says, "The Belt casts Shield once a day."

IniziiGM says, "it has a fancy buckle. ;)"

IniziiGM says, "And, the brooch is one that casts featherfall if you fall more then five feet. :)"

IniziiGM says, "Any of these are sellable, mind you. Money good. :)"

IniziiGM says, "As to the familiar bit, no. Zoa is a Corollax; it's a magical beast. A bird from the tropics that casts color spray. It'd take a feat, at a higher level, to get her. ;) "

IniziiGM says, "It's comparible to having, say, an imp as a familiar. Or a pseudodragon."
