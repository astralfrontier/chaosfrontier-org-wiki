# Inizii 2002-10-19

Logfile from PLKyrel

The first sign that things are just _not_ good is the sound of spellcasting. The ominmous, quick and fierce chant that rolls across the ground. In the back, Silniya's horse lets loose a startled, then terrified shriek of a whinny. At nearly the same moment, that 'covering' with the cracks on it erupts; out leaping from it a hurly, be-tusked human, later designated a Half-orc. The rattling, wicked links of a chain rush after him, before up over his head they swirl, lashing outward, leaping at Derleth.

The chain, although aimed toward his middle, is barely dodged as Platinum gives a stirred start. An angry, orcish Grunt is bestowed. The sound of Thundering hooves bestows. "Carry Through!" Speaks a voice in a lound timber, it's source unknown, though approaching Rose at a breakneck pace. Her first instincts asserting, reflexes kicking in. "Attack, Pin Down Kyrel!" Comes the voice again, before those hooves are nearly upon Rosalie.

And Rose's wind is knocked from her; out of nowhere appears a man in dark armor, his flail's impact rolling off the woman's chest. The steed stomps it's feet, urging back from it's charge, mist spilling from it's nostrils.

On the other side of Derleth, situated near the trees, appears a man holding a long-staffed weapon, it's wicked barbed head curved. His weapon whips out, scraping across Derleth's armor, and cursing the miss. "Knock them **down**!" Snarles the man on his horse.

The man on the branch above whips his net up, while legs are gripping the branch beneath, he heaves the item with accuracy; it opens up like a falling spiderweb, inner-laced nets hooking into cloak and cloths. "Ah ha!" He cackles.

Up higher on the hill, another point in the ground rustles. The spot of a head poking up, but more importantly, a crossbow. As the rain tumbles down, the bolt jumps from it's holder, and speeds towards Silniya, missing easily. It plunks into a nearby tree, but one thing is certain: judging by that glint off the head, it's most certainly silver.

"Wizard! Userp the Cleric!" Thundering once more, the sounds of spellcasting answer the horseman. Derleth's reflexes flench as he hears his role called, but the saddle beneath him starts to grow slick with grease.

Derleth takes in the surrounding activity in a second. Bad things are happening, by people who know their capacities. _So, time to do something completely unexpected._ He snaps Platinum's reigns, intent on getting the warpony away. And then, as fast as he can manage, he calls to his goddess for a recent prayer she has bequeathed him...suddenly, as Platinum bolts, it seems as though Derleth has dissapeared. In fact, however, he is still there, hovering. He has shifted into the Ethereal Plane.

As Derleth begins to cast, the chainman swings his weapon, expecting to knock the cleric off his block. It scores, surely, but the spell goes off, Derleth lost. "MAGE!" Screams the man on the horse. "You, Up on the wagon! Guard the mage!" This the half-orc does, scrambling up onto the back of the wagon.

Silniya has her own problems, at the moment. The horse seems to be fully under the spell; it's head jerks one way, or the other, before startling, and rearing up on it's back legs, kicking in the air and whinnying in fear. Silniya stays on, but unfortunately, she stays on as the horse turns and simply Bolts in the other direction.

The horseman glares through the visor of his helm at Rosalie, his horse stomping it's feet, moving quickly close. He doesn't speak, just swings his flail, weaving forward, then with a backward swing.

The first one Rose bends forward, missing with an easy swing, but on his backward stroke, the weapon bites fiercely into her shoulde.r

The halberdman runs up to the rope attached to the net, which the thrower had dropped. He grabs hold, and starts to yank the net Kyrel's confined in.

And, apparently, Kyrel hooking his feet beneath the wagon's bench, the tugging is futile, as the man fights with his halberd and the rope at the same time. "Damnit!"

Kyrel waits until the halberdman is fumbling with the rope and his weapon at the same time, then leaps down from the wagon, trying to roll underneath it.

The chainman grunts, atop the wagon. "Hey! Little pointy eared bastard! Get back here!"

Kyrel rolls under the wagon, away from the immediate reach of the halberd or the chain. With a moment's respite, he chants the harsh words of a spell, and the net collapses as a ferret streaks out from under the wagon toward the woods.

Rosalie looks around quickly, swearing under her breath. Throwing a leg over, she quickly slides off the horse. _Better to stand on solid ground in combat._ She snaps one hand, bringing forth her short sword, and sucks in a big gulp of air. _Freeze this!_ She exhales a spear of cold, expanding at the tip, that catches both the horseman and the mage in its path.

The blast of cold air leaps forth, washing across the horseman, his mount - which whickers in pain - and outword. The frost clings more towards the trees, as well as an insolible shield the mage had thrown up, leaving little damage to him. As the frost silts out, the horseman has his shield up, not having taken a brunt of the blast. He looks surprised, but the expression melts into a grim smile of delight. "Nice one," He compliments. The weight of his words hold murder.

"Men! Focus on her!" He barks.

As if on command, the man in the hole fires, the bolt hitting Rose in the back of the hip. Up in the tree, the man clinging to the branch whips a crossbow that was strapped around his waist, the shot going wide, sticking into the dirt not far off.

Behind the treeline, the mage's fingers weave into the workings of the Art. Or, more aptly, a spell to cancel out the Art. The ambush victims are being most tedius, in their reactionary castings. Best to wipe them off.

Which seems to peal no spells out of the area.

Everything is washed out and hazy to Derleth...but he can still tell friend from foe. He turns and 'flies' though the ether towards the mage as fast as he can manage...

The chainman grunts. "I'll find the mage! You, you go get the bitch." Halberd nods, as the orc jumps off the wagon, and starts sniffing, swinging his weapon around the bush. "Commer, you rat."

Silniya had clung onto the horse nearly for a hundred feet, trying to urge it to stop, or to do Something to get off it safely. But, finally deciding it's fruitless, she hurls herself off the horse, landing with a rolling thump-thump upon the ground. Up on her feet, swords coming out, she begins to change, before moving toward the battle as fast as she can.

"Nice," He repeats in a growl, spurring his steed up onto it's back legs, the hooves coming to bare on Rosalie, striking her in one vicious kick after the next, before bringing his flail down to clack her across the chin. "Nicer," He rumbles. Looking up, "I have her handled! Get the bitch on the way!"

The halberdman and archers seem to nod, the former turning toward the approaching Silniya.

Kyrel-ferret heads through the underbrush and scrambles up a tree, happy at how this form's claws grip the bark. He gets up to a branch that can support his normal weight and shifts back to his half-elven true form.

_This **isn't** going well._ Gritting her teeth, Rosalie looks at the dread horseman. _Running isn't sporting, but dying is so fatal._ Snapping her other hand, she drops the lit smokestick at her feet. Taking advantage of the billowing smoke, she dives into the trees, doing her best to meld with the forest, muttering about invisibility spells on demand under her breath.

Silniya charges towards the battlefield, and meets a small barrage of fire, the first shot deflected with her sword. However, the second, a silvered arrow catches her right in the lower arm, earning an angry, howling bark. Which suddenly turns into a dull thwack. Not having noticed the slight thickening of the air, nor the cool condensation clinging against her fur, until the Wall of Ice comes into being, Silniya running dead into it.

The mage lowers his hands, grinning grimly.

Rose's action causes a disturbance, the horseman letting loose an angry yell, his horse spurring up. "Find the bitch!" He snarls to the men on the road, "Find her! Do something!"

Derleth looks at the grinning mage with hateful eyes. _He takes pride in his work. Good. Thrashing him will be fun._ He shifts once more, returning to the Prime Material, standing behind the mage. He pulls out his medallion, pointing it at the mage's back. "Let the flames of Lliara strike you down!" he calls out, and a roaring column of flame descends on the mage...

The cylander of flame pours down onto the mage, and the tree he hides behind in flame. As it dissipates, the tree is on fire, and the remains of the mage are... Not pretty. The chainman grunts, and nods towards Kyrel, the Halberdman nodding, before the orc charges towards Derleth. The horseman comes out of the smoke, and follows suite. "Little bastard, I'm coming, Derleth. Archers! Pin down Kyrel!"

Silniya's swords leap forward, and simply tear into the enormous block of ice. Shoving forward, it nearly shatters, before her boot comes up and shatters the remnants. The freezing residue left over from the collapsing hole still clings to her, chilling to the bone, but she's charging in after it. "I think we have some problems, sir!"

The half-orc hurries forward, coming around a tree to let his chain do the biting into Derleth's flank, while the horseman approaches slowly, his steed staggering a little, ice still falling from it.

The halberdman snarls, spotting Kyrel and seeing he's out of reach. He turns to the charging werewolf, and swallows. Despite the weapon's tip gleams in silver light, amid the rain, that rushing beast doesn't look to promising. "Someone cover me!" He yells.

Derleth lets out a cry as the blade cuts past his armor. "This is the height of rudeness, you know...callin us by name when we haven't even been formally introduced..." he growls, fumbling for his flail...

Kyrel nods grimly as Derleth's column of flame takes out the enemy mage, and concentrates on the rider. _Payback time, then, whoever you are._ The harsh syllables of a spell ring out from his perch in the tree, and the green energy bolts fly out toward the horseman, sinking into him.

The spell blazes into the armored rider, and he nearly falls over, but rights himself. Ignoring the mage, for the moment, "The Zhentriam say hello," He hisses to Derleth while baring down on him.

Derleth groans. _So much for trusting that Zhent to keep his mouth shut._ "Give Cyric my regards when I send you to meet him, then." he snarls in response.

Moving quietly, Rosalie unlimbers her bow. She eyes the archer in the tree, and then takes careful aim, hoping to do serious damage.

The archer was leaning over the branch, his crossbow aimed down at Kyrel. He jerks, as the arrow dives into his ribs. "Bitch!" However, he can't quite shoot her around the tree, and instead fires down at Kyrel.

Apparently, the shot made him miss his mark, the bolt grazing across Kyrel's cheek.

The shot from the hill sniper drives his bolt into Silniya's stomach, nearly making her double over. But, she keeps on coming, the Halberdman in her sights. He knows it, inching toward the wagon.

Derleth notes the horseman coming at him, and abruptly backs out of the chain-wielder's range. "You made the wrong decision today, Zhentscum!" he spits, and points his left hand in the mounted Zhentilar's direction, chanting familiar syllables to Lliara...and a beam of holy burning light shoots forth...

The bolt blazes in, searing through the man's visor, before shield comes up to protect his face from any other assault. A restrained cry nearly excapes, and if he didn't lean forward against the saddle's horn, he would've fallen off his horse.

"Uh uh," Grunts the half-orc with a chuckle, and he leaps forward, his chain whipping above his head. It lashes forward, and wraps about Derleth's feet. Boots digging into the muddy ground, a hard **lurch** backward, and the cleric falls to the earth.

Silniya licks her teeth, her pace still ready. If she charges head on, the man will get an extra hit in. But if she takes her time in approach, he'll just back up. So be it, then. One sword held, ready to deflect the hit, her short blade held ready, she dives towards him.

The halberd comes down, striking Silniya across skull, but in a slight graze. But it doesn't stop her weight from coming forward, and the blade is drive into the man's stomach. It doesn't kill him, but certainly earns a bloody cry from him.

The horseman sits back in the saddle, his face looking scarred and burnt through the gap in the helmet. He reaches into his belt, drawing forth a small... wand? Releasing his shield, letting it stay strapped to his forearm, he grips the wand. Shaking the flail at the cleric, "Stay out of the high forest, Derleth, and the rest of you. Or your families will recieve your pieces, mailed one at a time." The wand is snapped, and leaning forward to hug his wounded horse's throat, both melt into the air, dissappearing.

The halberdman swallows, and staggers back, swinging his weapon down unto the werewolf.

And it's tartly smacked out of the way, a threatening growl issuing from her, blood staining fur amid the wind and rain.

The half-orc, though, blanches as his commander disappears.

Kyrel swears under his breath as the horseman vanishes. "The rest of you, throw down your weapons or die!"

Derleth smiles grimly at the half-orc. "Your Sword has left you, lackey. And your mage is crisped. Make the smart choice, fool." he says, referring to the term for a Zhentilar warrior-leader.

Rosalie fades back into the bushes, watching curiously but from the best cover she can find.

The halberdman seems to recognize this fact, and his weapon clatters down. In his tree, one archer lets his bow ease down, not yet loaded. "Smart choice?" he grumps with a smirk. "What's to 'sure you won't be killing me and mine, eh?" Moving forward, looking at the downed cleric, "Bet I could gutcha before they get me." Of course, he isn't pulling that chain back for another strike. The man in the hole on the hill ducks down, hidden.

Derleth waves the hand he burned the Sword with at the Half-Orc. "Try it. I've no compunctions about making you dead...but if you surrender in good faith, we'll let you live. And if it turns out you're one of Cyric's true followers...you'll regret it." he murmurs threateningly, referring to the God of Lies.

The 'lid' of the fox hole, a grass-constructed mat erupts, as the crossbowman leaps out, and Streaks over the top of the hill.

As Rosalie takes a step back, her foot lands on ... on air? She slips, sliding through a small depression. The noise alone is enough to give away her position.

The half-orc smirks. "Right, Spell-begger," He replies, pulling up the chain... and pausing. The delivery is relatively weak, but the reaffirming aura around Derleth, the hard look in the short man's eyes earn a second thought. He cows, but keeps face, snorting while eases back onto his heels. He tugs on the chain, and lets it down, to hang on his hip.

Silniya promptly steps on the halberd, and breaks it in half, before a strike from her longsword shatters the silver-tipped blade. "That wasn't nice," She snarls, waving the shortsword under the man's nose. "On knees." He simply does so. Walking around behind him, she shifts back into human form.

Derleth keeps a close eye on the half-orc as he frees himself from the chain. _My god, it worked. I intimidated a warrior twice as big as me._ "Move over by your friend." he says, indicating the already-surrendered Halberdier.

Rolling the chain up on his forearm, a leather bracer that keeps the hooks from digging into his flesh, the half-orc keeps his weapon, almost like a way to keep his manhood. He stares shrewdly at Derleth a moment, before complying, hooking the handle of the chain into his belt, as he marches over. After a hesitant moment, the treed archer starts to climb down.

Kyrel floats free of his tree, moving to get a better view of the remaining archer and keeping them all covered with the threat of additional spells. "We let that last fellow go free and asked to stay out of this mess, and this is the thanks we get?"

Derleth lets Sil keep an eye on the suddendered Zhentilar. "Ky? Rose? You okay?"

Kyrel nods. "I'm fine. Rosalie took the brunt of things, I'm afraid."

They look up at Kyrel blankly. The half-orc finally asks, "What?"

Derleth moves over to find Rose, letting Kyrel interrogate them.

Kyrel says, "Hmm. Not that your bosses would have told you... who told you we'd be coming through here?"

Rosalie slowly limps into the road, her bow hanging over her shoulder as both hands press against her ribs. "I think, Derleth, I could use a little of the lady's aid ..." Blood is flowing liberally down the side of her head, and pooling in her tunic, just above her hip.

Both look to the half-orc, who glares at them both, until answering, "Sytus." "Came out of the Hi-" The archer begins, before the half-orc backhands him. "He came from our trading post, southeast of here, south of the High Forest, along our traderoute.

Derleth swears at the sight of Rose. "Bright lady, lend me your power..." he murmurs, reaching out with glowing hands to lay on Rose's battered form...

Kyrel says, "So what's the hassle with the High Forest, anyway? We've got business there, and we don't really give a damn about you and the fool Harpers. They won't let us just go in, bury an old friend, and leave again?"

"That's not what we heard," The half-orc growls. "You're here snooping on Portals."

Kyrel sighs. "I will admit to an interest in Portals, but that's not why we're here. I didn't even know there _were_ any in the High Forest."

Rosalie straightens up, looking at Derleth. "Thanks. When everyone disappeared, so suddenly, I felt a little ... overwhelmed."

Silniya moves towards Derleth, bleeding a bit. She doesn't look too grevious, but certainly hurt.

Derleth smiles at Rose. "Well, we figured you were more than competant enough to get yourself out...the idea was to remove an immediate target from their crosshairs. I'm sorry. We didn't mean to make you feel abandoned."

Derleth moves to tend to Sil then, fussing over her wounds now. "I hate it when folks are prepared with silver..."

All three of them just stare at Kyrel. The chained man smirks. "Right." "There's business here you's tampering with," Says the halberder, who cringes as the Half-orc turns.

Rosalie moves to stand next to Kyrel, her hand now holding her short sword suggestively. She looks at each of the men in turn, thoughtfully chewing her lip. "Would you like some help, Kyrel? Some days I'm good at ...", she pauses, grinning and flexing her knuckles, "... eliciting answers from bullies."

A bob of her head, rubbing the blood off her forehead. "I agree... There's no possible way this was about the the other day in Westbridge. They were too well informed."

Kyrel blinks as the prisoners just _stare_ at him when he makes that comment. _Right. Miller must have been telling tales out of school._ "Umm... anyway..." He smiles gratefully at Rosalie. "Thanks. It's not that, so much as the fact that even underlings seem to know too much about us."

Derleth smiles fondly at his lover. "Information didn't protect them from you, sweetling." He lays hands on her, wiping the blood from her face...

The Halberder lifts his hands. "Hey, hey, we don't know that much! Just that a 'Friend' warned Sytus's superiors that someone lookin' into portals was comin'... and about your names, and..." He looks towards Silniya. "Your common tactics," The half-orc replies, before looking at Rose. "They didn't know much 'bout you."

The wounds heal, Silniya feeling invigorated. "I didn't do much... The damned horse was too frightened... Rose nearly got herself killed; I wasn't here to offer support."

Rosalie growls, stepping forward. "A common enough mistake. And one that should be remedied." She turns back at Kyrel. "They knew more than names. They knew tactics, battle plans, habits .." She leans forward, staring at the half orc, and then reconsiders, lifting him up by the shirt front so that his feet dangle off the ground. "I want a name, bub."

Derleth shakes his head. "Bad luck happens, unfortunately. If they hadn't surrendered, you'd have made mincemeat out of them. Besides. It was your return to the field that turned the tide back in our favor."

Derleth suddenly kisses her. "You're a bloodthirsty wench, but you're my bloodthirsty wench." he says afterwards, grinning at her.

Silniya snorts, and pats Derleth. "Come now. Fratranizing in front of the prisoners isn't wise." She wanders back over.

The half-orc squirms, the big man, about the size of Rosalie, is off the ground. Fingers clench, and he takes a slow breath through his nose. "Don't know," He replies in a grunt. "If Sytus knew, he don't say. Someone in the Forest knows. They've been helpin' the higher ups."

Derleth chuckles, and then goes over to the remains of the Zhentarim mage. _There might be something useful on his remains...Zhentarim can be counted on having some magical trinkets to back them up...hopefully, Lliara's holy fire didn't destroy them..._

Rosalie shakes the half orc. "Think harder, bub. If I was to go looking for this friend, where would I find him. And how." She waves him about a bit, as she gestures angrily. "I'm on vacation. I don't approve of shenanigans while on vacation." She pauses pointedly.

By the looks of it, it destroyed a good bit. The man has a tattoo, a book with open pages across his arm, that shows up in the singed skin. On his belt are a few burnt scrolls, as well as one or two used ones, at his feet, destroyed. However, there looks to be a relatively survived pouch on his belt.

"I Don't Know!" He snarls back down at her, despite the fear in his eyes. "You crazy bint, you think they tell us? We's grunts! We's soldiers! You want to know? Find Sytus! We don't know nothin' about who's helpin' who! We's more worried about the Forest's denizens, and the Drow!"

Both Archer and Halberd cringe slightly. "Damnit, Rull," One mutters.

Derleth blinks and looks up at the mention of Drow. _Well, fuck._

Kyrel straightens at the mention of Drow. "There's Drow in the High Forest?"

Rull looks apologetic, but sighs. "Eilistraeens. Silver whores, they are."

Rosalie raises one eyebrow sardonically. "Drow. Forest Denizens. Keep talking, bub."

Derleth relaxes, then. _Good aligned drow. Hmm. Interesting._

Kyrel says, "Ah, those Drow. Not a problem for us, I suppose."

Rosalie shakes Rull a little more. "I think you want to talk about Sytus. I think you want to tell me everything you know about Sytus. I think you want to tell me who he is, where he lives, how I can find him ... I think you want your comrades to confirm everything, lest I fail to believe you. "

Derleth takes a moment to cast a spell to detect magic, to determine if the scrtoll's magic is intact...

Rull nods his head, "Right, drow. They's a problem. You's a problem. We don't need to problems helpin' eachother." He hurks, as he's shaken. "What'cha want, names of whores? He's in the complex, just like us! In the Forest! North o' Unicorn run! Camp! That way!" He points. "Small fort! Defended!"

Derleth makes note that the Tattoo looks like something applied to magic, not so much a key to some ritual or group. The tattoo glows of magic, as does a few of the scrolls in the belt, and whatever's in the beltpouch.

Rosalie turns to look at the other two, grinning toothily. "I think you two want to confirm what Rull says, don't you. I think you want to share even more details."

Derleth tucks the scrolls in his belt, and starts riflnig throug the pouch, glancing at the glow tattoo curiously.

They nod. "Agree with her!" Rull barks. "He's right! He's right. Sytus'll be there, with the garrison, and the other leaders, man named Banner, as well as Anallis, leader."

Rosalie drops Rull on the ground. "Hey Kyrel! Can I borrow three pieces of paper? And some charcoal?"

Derleth finds some gold, a Zhentriam badge, and a single bead.

Derleth calls out. "I have ink."

It is the bead which glows of magic.

Kyrel nods. "Sure. How big do they need to be?" He starts rummaging in the Bag.

Rull unruffles the leather padding under his armor, and huffs. He glares at the other two.

Derleth pockets the gold and the bead. _I don't want to be caught with the badge, nor have it used as a Scrying focus._ He moves back to the others.

Silniya clears her throat, behind the three. "Should I lead them off, and see to them they leave?"

Kyrel nods to Silniya, and glances at Derleth. "Sounds good to me. What do you all think about it?"

Rosalie says, "Big enough for each of these gentlemen to draw us a map of the garrison." She turns to look at the prisoners, and tilts her head, smiling winsomely, all pointy sharp teeth showing. "You will do that, for me, won't you? All I want is a map from each of you, showing me where Banner, Anallis, and Sytus bunk. And when how many people are on watch." She shakes her head at Silniya. "Not yet."

Derleth folds his arms. "I'd say I don't like Zhentarim, and I like leaders who abandon their men even less." he says shortly.

The light dawns in Kyrel's mind, and he gives a grin nearly as nasty as Rose's. "Ah... and done independently, of course. Very nice idea."

All three look at eachother. "We's dead," Rull confirms.

Derleth cocks his head. "Not if you don't return to the forest."

Rull thumbs his way down the trail. "Agents in Westbridge." He thumbs towards the south. "Agents on the trade route. This place's gettin' think of 'em, hopin' things go down."

Rosalie nods at Rull. "If you draw the maps, we let you leave. In any direction you choose. And otherwise, Rull, I get to practise ripping half orcs limb from limb. And you know, bub, it's been a while. I could _really_ use the practice."

Rull looks cross at Rose. "You don't know what they do t'traitors, do you?"

Rosalie sighs. "Oh, and Kyrel? If the maps agree, would you be willing to teleport them out of here?"

They all three look surprised at that.

Kyrel nods. "Why not? I can get them to Selegaunt, no problem."

Derleth scratches his chin. "That's a pretty nice thing to do for folks that were trying to kill us a second ago...although, if it gets us good intel..."

Kyrel says, "Exactly. It's not being nice to them. It's payment for services rendered." He looks sternly at the three. "_If_ the maps match."

Rosalie looks back at Rull. "So you choose. Rending practice, or a lift to Selegaunt." She looks at her finger nails, one of which looks a little torn. "Now, me, I'd vote for the rending. But ..."

"We'll do it," They chime in unison.

The halberdman looks around. "In the rain?"

Derleth glances back at the Tree in rememberance, wonderi if he needs to put out any fires.

By now it's out. The wet leaves and wood didn't burn too well, after the initial blast.

Kyrel says, "That would be messy... we can get you cover easily enough."

Rosalie looks around. "Der, if you'll guard one under the cart, I can take on under that tree, and Silniya, if you'll take the other one and take shelter there?" She grins at the prisoners. "We'll see you safe to Selegaunt, yet. I may even send a recommendation with you, if you want a ... job."

Silniya removes her longsword, and gives a prompt nod. "I've got Him," She says with a pointed glare at the Halberdman.

Which earns a squirm from the man.

"Uh, Kyrel?" The archer lifts his hand, tapping the side of his cheek. "Y'got a little... nick, right here."

"Must've caught a branch, or something," He adds.

Derleth grins at Rull. "And you thought we couldn't get along." he says semi-mockingly.

Rull snorts. "The paper, then?"

Kyrel reaches up to dab at his bleeding cheek. "So I do. Doesn't seem to be serious, though. Must have been that shot that almost hit me. I thought it'd missed completely."

Derleth hands a piece of paper to Rull, motioning him over. "Make us proud. You might have an artist's blood in you and you never knew it."

The archer doesn't comment. _I can't blame Rosalie, and I can't claim the credit... Keeping my mouth shut is good. Yeah._

Rosalie says, "Kyrel? If you could share some paper?" She turns to look at each of the men. "And I'll keep Rull. He ... suits me." _And next time I'm in some town, I really need to pick up some paper._

He grins a little at Rosalie.

Kyrel pulls out parchment and ink and a few pens. "Here we go. Everything we need for a little mapping."

Derleth chuckles and shakes his head.

All three seperate, and do their drawing. Rull's seems the most detailed, noting the garrison barracks, which isn't much more then a shack with a hole in the bottom, a wall, and a small building in the center. THe guardposts on the archer's and Rull's show up best, paticularly with the Archer putting most detail on a sniping spot in a tree within the Wall's peremeter. The Halberder's map is the most shakey and a little damp, likely from the fact Silniya was staring over his shoulder, but they roughly link up. He makes note of a few scouting spots around the fort, however.

After comparing the maps, and making marks on Rull's map which will probably become the master map, Rosalie gives the maps to Derleth. Approaching the prisoners, she pats them on the head. "You are all such _good_ boys." She sounds and looks disappointed for a moment, then brightens. "Now I know someone who could use a few fellows like you. In Selegaunt. If you take him a message ..."

"Right," Rull grunts, and bobs his head. "Whatever ya say."

Rosalie grins. "Would you like the job, too?"

Three nods.

Kyrel looks up from where he's been working on his spells. "Avos, you mean? Yeah, they'd probably fit in nicely with his organization, wouldn't they?"

Derleth considers warning them about the Mill, just in case she did sell them up the river, but decides against it. _These aren't Paladins of Tyr. If they don't watch their own backs..._ He mentally shrugs.

Rosalie steps away to compose a short note, enclosing the map. _Avos; I give you a Zhentarim garrison. These three young men can answer any further questions you have. You might find them quite useful. They're well trained, and share a strong desire to stay out of the lime light for a long time._ Sealing the note carefully, she mutters under her breath. Light shines out for a moment. Then she returns, handing the note to Rull. "It's sealed by magic; only Avos can open it safely."

Derleth takes Kyrel over to the body of the fallen mage, and shows him the tattoo now that they have a free moment. "It's still active. Can you tell what magic it is?"

Kyrel peers at the fallen mage's body, murmuring the syllables of detect magic.

Kyrel peers over the tattoo, and after a moment, he knows exactly what it is. There is a spell he heard about, during his training; one of the Battlemages of the city had crafted his weapon, and then cast a spell that linked it to his very body. It was hidden in a tattoo on his arm; when he called it forth, it came forward, into his hand. After a good guess, this mage is likely doing the same thing with Something.

The two just seem happy to be getting out of there. Rull sniffs the letter a second, before stuffing it into his armor. "Good, then."

Kyrel says, "Hmm. A link spell of some sort. Similar to what Rose's gloves do. Don't know what he's got in there."

Derleth says, "Probably can't trigger it, can you?"

Kyrel says, "Not easily. I'm not sure I want to, either. Sometimes they're booby traps."

Derleth nods. "Okay. Let's get these jokers out of here, then...and I can show you the other stuff I got."

Kyrel nods. "I'll see you in a few minutes." He walks back to where the ex-Zhents are waiting. "You told them how to find Avos?"

Rull glances towards the Tree line. "Did good work on the mage. Tho his job was just to keep your spells from not workin'. Most dangerous thing's a spellcaster." The tusked grin is wide. "Guess he just didn't focus on the right one."

Derleth decides, in spite of himself, he likes the orc. "Mages burn good." he agree.

Rosalie grins toothily. "Yeah."

"Smell good too."

Kyrel harrumphs. "Hey!"

Rosalie chuckles, placing one finger on Rull's lips. "Be a good boy for Avos, Rull, and someday we'll meet again ..."

Derleth pats Kyrel. "Not you, my friend."

"Don't lift me up, next time," He says simply.

Rosalie grins. "Don't piss me off?" She holds out a hand. "Good luck."

"Don't get shot," He grunts.

He shakes Rose's hand. "Can we get goin' now?"

Kyrel concentrates, calling up the image of the out-of-the-way alley where he spent so much time waiting for Rosalie to come back from visiting Avos. "Hands on each other's shoulders, please..." He chants the spell, touching his hands to the half-orc's shoulder, and a moment later, they are in Selegaunt near the Saucy Mermaid. "That's the bar. Talk to the old one-legged gentleman inside, and tell him that Tessa sent you." He sees them on their way, then casts the second spell to return. He reappears in the forest only a few minutes after he'd left.

Derleth shakes his head. "It's too bad they worked for the Network. Now it won't get back to the others that we spare and relocate captives." he snorts amusedly.

Kyrel says, "The only way to travel..."

Derleth says, "Oh, Kyrel...Also found these on the mage."

Derleth hands over the scrolls and the bead.

Rosalie nods at Kyrel. "There's something to be said for the plane way too, though. More adventures." She looks around. "And on that note, I think it's time we found our horses and resumed our ride ..."

Kyrel flips open the scrolls. "Looks like ... Dimension Door and a Dispel Magic." He throws away the third. "That one didn't survive the flame." He considers the bead for some time before shrugging. "Don't know what this does."

Rosalie looks farther down the trail. "You can ride my spare horse, Silniya. I'm sure she won't mind. And I think I need to go catch mine and feed her an apple or two."

Silniya grins a little bit, and nods. "Thanks, Rose." Her head tilts, looking toward the trail. "I'm riding in front. I should be able to spot any serious threats, as soon as we get into the forest. It's my enviorment."

Kyrel says, "Do you want to go track down your mount, Sil? We can wait here while you go wolf if you want to."

Rosalie nods at Silniya. "I'll keep you company. I wouldn't mind working out a few group tactics, for the next ambush."

SIlniya rubs her chin. "The rain has no doubt washed the scent, but I'll go and see if I can hunt down the colt."

Kyrel says, "And we've already had our ambush for the evening..."

Derleth Hmmms. "This could be off one of those necklaces I'd heard that creates fireballs..we should stop by Aurora's Magic Emporium. They tend to have a standard command word the folks there might know." He pockets the bead.

Kyrel nods. "It is an evocation spell. Could be."

Silniya eventually finds her mount. A better place to settle into is found, and the party then heads onward. With Silniya as guide, they avoid several possible threats, a suggestion of tracks and scat noting the territory of an owlbear, which Silniya finds the fringe of territory, and passing through is easy. Sleeping in Rope tricks, with vigil watches over the Horses prove effective. However, on the third day, a small, deep creak is came to.

Derleth hmms, and tries to check the map for the creek. "This can't be Unicorn Run...and by the way, you think we should bury the fellow now? We're well inside the forest's borders."

Rosalie says, "Maybe we could try talking to him again first? Something he said ... confused me."

Silniya shakes her head. "There are some Wood elves likely a day's travel from here. We drop him off there. I think we should water the horses, now."

Derleth nods. "Maybe they're know something about the worshippers of Elistraee. I'm inclinded to see what they're doing that pisses off the Zhents..."

Kyrel grins. "And give them a hand with it, too."

Rosalie nods. "And perhaps sell them copies of a map?"

Derleth chuckles.

Silniya draws a few of the horses towards a large tree by the water-side, before the deep sound of a **Thwack!** issues from it. As well as three others, rapidly. "Fuck!"

Otherwise, there's nothing. Everyone's reflexes dig into expecting a fight and... Silence. Nothing. A cricket could cough.

Derleth blinks and yanks his flail free, rushing to Sil's side..."What was that?"

Rosalie looks around intently, hoping to spot the archer ...

Silniya's swords are out, staring across the creek. Implanted in the tree's trunk are four arrows. Three in a rough triangle around another, which looks like it has a message attached. There are two thinks most noticable about this. One, that the arrows are nearly the size of Javelins. Two, that they're imbedded inches into the tree's trunk.

Rosalie stalks up to the arrows. "This gets ... tiresome." She pulls the arrow with the message out of the tree, and opens the message.

Kyrel looks at the arrows. "Someone is showing off. What's the message say?"

Derleth says, "If it's the wood elves, makes sense. They're good archers."

_Dear reader. First, I would like to ask that Kyrel please keep Kiri close to him. The message deliverer will shoot the bat down, if he leaves more then ten feet from Kyrel's place. Otherwise, there will be no firing on your little traveling party. Second, nice move changing your appearnces. But it doesn't help when the entire forest is watching and expecting you._

_Third, good show with the Zhentarim. You're just as good as I was told. I am clapping you. I had to assess your strenghts, you know._

\*\*\*\*That should proably be changed to 'I applaud you.'

Rosalie hands the message to Kyrel. "I'd suggest keeping Kiri in your cloak for now. And we're being watched. Probably by the gnome." She puts her hands on hips, turning a full turn. "This is going to be a big funeral, then", she announces somewhat more loudly than usual.

Derleth looks over Kyrel's shoulder. "What is it that everyone and his brother knows our names?" he says sourly.

_If you are looking for somewhere to deposit your dead friend, there is a Wood Elf outpost a day's travel North east of here. It will be in a tree with a few red leaves. I suggest that you hold your hands up, four hundred feet before approaching; the elves like to shoot first, shoot second, and not ask questions at all._

Kyrel reads it over. "Interesting. Whoever it is doesn't want to be spied on, apparently. Some good advice about dealing with Wood Elves... and a bit of smugness about testing us. Doesn't seem to be actual enemies, though."

Rosalie grumbles under her breath. "Always nice to meet a _friendly_ relative ..." She looks around again. "Who is our dead friend? And who is our Watcher?"

Derleth blinks. "Not the wood elves. I was wondering why the arrows weren't their famed 'black lightning'. But why do you think it's the gnome?"

Kyrel jerks a thumb back toward the wagon. "The one we've been calling Mr. Bones. He wanted to be buried in Elven lands."

Rosalie says, "It smells like him?" She turns to Kyrel. "I know. But what's his name. We can't bury him as Mr Bones.'"

There seems to be just a little bit more. _If you are wondering if I am with the Zhentarim, no. Nor am I with the Eilistraeens. Speaking of them, they are two days travel from that wood elf post. I will try to ensure that you do not become the victim of any 'roaming monster' attacks. However, there are some creatures that are just stupid or random. I wish to meet with you, before you arrive to the Eilistraeens. If you agree, cast a light spell on the top of the tree that was just shot. You will recieve further instructions, if you agree. I look forward to it, if you do._

Rosalie looks at the party. "Shall we meet him?"

Derleth scratches his nose. "I admit to some curiosity."

Kyrel chuckles. "That's one of the things we need to ask him. We ran out of questions the last time." He nods. "I don't see why not. It's not like we're committed to obeying any instructions, if we don't want to."

Derleth says, "Maybe it's some powerful faerie or druid."

Kyrel murmurs, "Not mutually exclusive..."

Kyrel goes back to look at the arrows. "Big. Giant, perhaps? Or maybe Centaur?"

Derleth coughs. He considers using his wand, but he has the spell on hand, so...getting a line of sight with the top of the tree, he suffuses it with magical radiance.

Silniya looks over the arrow. "Whatever this came from, it did not come from a normally sized longbow."

The top of the tree has a slight glow to it, a green aura. Not a moment before a final arrow slams home into the spot where the message one once was. Yet another note.

Derleth chuckles. "Cute."

Kyrel just raises an eyebrow. "Definitely showing off."

Rosalie pulls the final arrow out, handing the note to Kyrel.

"I think the point is," Silniya says with a knitted brow, glaring off into the treeline, "That we can be shot down at their leisure."

Kyrel accepts the new note. "Let's see what the courier's brought."

Kyrel nods. "Certainly seems that way."

Derleth ponders, at that moment, to keep a plane shifting spell on hand from then on. Going ethereal is all very well, but it doesn't get your friends out of danger.

_Excellent. If you travel due east of the Wood Elf post, after a day and a half's travel, there will be a shattered tree. A half mile south of this will be a clearing. I will meet you there. Under no circumstances should any scrying, dispelling, or prying magic be inabled. Nor will Kiri be out at all. If any of these requests are not met, I will be forced to inact disciplinary action. Purely for my and mine protection, you understand. I look forward to you. And you, too, Rosalie._

Rosalie grins, nods, and makes a note.

Derleth says, "Paranoid fellow. Now I'm very curious."

Kyrel says, "Indeed. Of course, with Wood Elves, Zhents, and Drow roaming around, he's got every reason to be paranoid."

Silniya looks off towards the archer's possible position. "Much like us. And likely enough fire-power to be backing up every statement."

Derleth says, "If he's that capable, I wonder why he'd bother with us."

_Why me, in particular?_ Rosalie looks around, irritation writ large on her features.

Silniya stares at the arrow for several long minutes, shaking her head. "I don't like this, at all."

Derleth shrugs. "He hasn't hurt us...yet. And we don't have to decide immediately."

"It doesn't smell right," She says, sniffing at the shaft. "It's... got an odor on it, that I can't place. It's not centaur; they usually have a paticular style to their arrowheads. It certainly smells... animal-like, though."

A shake of her head, stowing it away in her pack. "I don't like it."
