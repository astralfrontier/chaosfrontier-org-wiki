# Inizii 2002-11-02

Logfile from PLKyrel

The rest of the day is spent traveling, as suggested via the messages. Moving the cart through the forest is a paticular annoyance, slowing down in some areas, but night eventually comes. It's suggested that the group sleeps within a Rope Trick, purely for the avoidance of being ambushed, as well as not drawing any roaming beasts. A spot within the dimensional space allows for a viewing outward, thus whoever's 'on watch' can keep an eye on the horses. The night passes uneventfully. The next moring, Silniya is off hunting breakfast, while Kyrel and Derleth take to their morning rituals of magical programming.

Rosalie wanders around the campsite, aimlessly tending the horses, checking tack, brushing off saddles, and looking sideways at the cart a lot. Especially at the macabre contents in the tent. She bites her lip, looking over at Derleth. _We should talk to Mr Bones soon ..._ Making up her mind, she ambles over to Derleth. "Ummmm ..."

Rosalie sits on her haunches next to Derleth, using a slim dagger to trim her fingernails and clean away small amounts of dirt. "Derleth? Before we go any further, do you have any suggestions on ways to talk to the corpse?"

Derleth was seemingly distracted at first, fussing over Platinum..but when she speaks up, he hears her. "Hmm? oh...well, I have a spell to contact his spirit...and as long as he's willing, it shouldn't be a problem."

Kyrel finishes his own spell preparations quickly, not having expended many the previous day. "Talking to him is easy enough... it's getting answers that's tricky."

Derleth shrugs at Kyrel. "Only if he doesn't want to give the answers."

"Do you think we could? He seemed ... " She looks diffident, digging deeper under her fingernails. "He seemed to know me."

Silniya returns with game, some finches and and a rabbit. The latter she gives a slight glare to, as it's cleaned. _Hard to catch little scamp..._ Rose having made the fire earlier, Sil simply sets to cooking, with the trail rations purchased in Westridge.

Derleth smiles. "I'm not sure what you're asking. Yes, we can ask him questions. we can ask him if he does know you, as well. And wether he wants to or not, the spell will compel him...he just might not give a straightforward answer. Of course, if he appears to us, like he did at the destroyed inn, all the rules are off,"

Leaning over to dig at something in the ground, Rosalie mumbles something that sounds like assent. Finally excavating a twig, she throws it on the fire. "So, ummmm, can we ask him questions now?"

Pausing a moment, Silniya rises, walking over. "Where are the messages and arrows from yesterday?"

Derleth glances at Sil. "Kyrel held onto them, I think."

Derleth looks back at Rose. "I suppose. But why not wait till the day before we put him to rest? He's more likely to come."

Kyrel says, "The arrows are in the cart. The messages are right here...." He reaches into the Bag and pulls them out. "Here they are."

Silniya nods her head, smiling wanely to Kyrel. "Something's been nagging me about them. I want to look them over. Thank you." Claiming them, she returns to the fire, continuing the food while looking over both messages.

Derleth glances at Sil. "What, are you a graphologist? You think you can tell something from his handwriting?"

"What if he doesn't want to come, Derleth? Or what if he senses the burial grounds and disappears? Or what if he knows more about what we're heading into." Rosalie shakes her head. "I don't like the fact he recognized me."

The ranger glances sidelong at Derleth. "More on how they say it, then what they say." After a few moments of looking them over, "These don't strike me as druids, at all."

Derleth chuckles. "Rose, the body can't jsut dissapear. And his spirit...well, his spirit is already wandering the planes. He can't go to Aravandor till his body is at rest. And I'm sure he'll stick around to make sure we do the job right." He turns to look squarely at Rose. "Is this really important? After all, I don't want an angry elf spirit on my hands just because you were curious about something."

Rosalie turns to look at Derleth, a troubled expression on her face. "I don't know. I don't like it. First the ghost recognized me, and now whoever wrote that note singled me out. I don't like it at all." She goes back to digging in the ground. "I've been worrying about it all night."

Rosalie looks up at Silniya. "I know what's bothering me about those notes. The names he uses. Kiri, for instance. Why does the bat have to stay hidden? Is he going to be invisible?"

Kyrel says, "Kiri doesn't have to stay hidden, just close. But I suspect that's it... he's good at ignoring invisibility."

Derleth scratches his chin. "I can only keep his spirit bound for ten minutes, for up to five questions. But finding out how he wants the body buried wouldn't take up all five questions. If you're sure you want me to do this now..."

"It just sounds as though we're walking into a trap." Rosalie turns to Derleth. "Five questions? Maybe we should decide what to ask for the first two questions, first? Maybe, how do you want to be buried, and where do you know me from?"

Silniya turns the food again, and rises, walking over. "Well, there is the invisibility factor. But hasn't Kiri pierced illusions too? As well, he can find people hiding in the bushes, or far off, so forth. Basicly, the sender's guards, or contingencies." A shake of her head. "Druids don't do this. I will not say they aren't intelligent, or witty, but they do not act superior. Very down to earth. Nor do they use illusions and false pretenses. When dealing with them, you get what you see."

Kyrel says, "I had the impression they were some kind of fey, or perhaps just a settlement of eccentric gnomes."

"They know an aweful lot about us for some forest-dwelling gnomes," Sil points out.

Derleth shakes his head. "The questions have to be very specific, if you want to get a clear answer. Well, perhaps not the first one...it doesn't help the spirit to lie about the rituals he needs to go to his final rest. How about...hmm..." Derleth thinks about this. He does not comment on the other conversation, trying to focus on one thing at a time.

Derleth smirks wryly at Sil. "Everyone appears to know a lot about us, these days. It's dammned annoying."

Kyrel says, "I think the Mill has been telling tales on us."

The ranger purses her lips. "It could be a demon."

Derleth sighs. "That's the problem with information brokers...they don't know how to keep a secret."

Rosalie turns to Derleth. "We could ask him how he stands related to Moonfinder Tarragonish. That could tell us a lot."

Derleth blinks dumbly at Rosealie. "Who a who?"

Kyrel chuckles. "They know how. They just get paid not to."

Rosalie says, "Moonfinder Tarragonish. He's half the reason I was finally able to convince mother to let me out. Otherwise I would still be baby sitting ..."

IniziiGM walks back to the fire, and turns the meat again, sifting some things in the cooking pot, before returning.

Kyrel says, "You said the arrows smelled somewhat animalish, Sil. Wouldn't demons smell more of brimstone?"

Silniya shrugs her shoulders. "Just because a demon is at the head, doesn't mean his arms are the same. Since Hellgate Keep was sundered, not far from the edge of the Forest, what fiends are left have filtered down into the Forest. Not to mention the Fey'ari."

Rosalie smiles apologetically at Derleth. "I used to think your Mr Bones was Moonfinder, but now I'm not convinced ..."

Derleth seems frustrated by having two equally interesting conversations going on, and not being able to concentrate on both. "But, if he was someone you knew, wouldn't you have recognized his ghost?"

Rosalie nods. "Maybe. I haven't seen Moonfinder since I was very very small though. So if Mr Bones is one of his friends ..."

Derleth scratches his chin. "I see. But let's try to make it a question that can't be answered yes or no. Hmm. let me think..."

Kyrel says, "True. Well, we'll just have to see." He gets up and moves over to where Rosalie and Derleth are discussing the body. "So who's this Moonfinder person? Sounds like there's a story in there somewhere."

Derleth says, "Then again, I think the question you posited earlier might be best. How are you related to Moonfinder."

Rosalie grins. "That's what I was thinking. I wonder if he's related to me?" She suddenly bends over her dagger again, completely intent on a patch of dirt.

Derleth hmms. Now things start to coalesce for him, but he does not comment. "Ah...I suppose I should be about it then...but I'm not going to be able to discuss questions with you, once the spell starts. So come up with them quickly."

After looking over the notes again several times, Silniya rolls them up, placing them in her belt, before returning to the fire. "Come and get it!"

Rosalie nods. "Kyrel, do you want to ask questions too?"

Derleth looks greedily at the fire. "But, breakfast first."

Kyrel says, "I didn't have any to ask, really. Unless you can ask him his date of death, since he doesn't know how long it's been."

Derleth stuffs himself with food, and then unloads the coffin from the cart with SIl's help. Taking off the top, he murmurs a supplication to Lliara, taking off his pendant and placing it on the corpse's 'chest'...uttering the summoning to the elf's spirit...

A slight, pale glow comes off the bones. Not so much a glow, because it would seem emitted in a grey spectrum. But it ripples, spreading outward from the corpse, drawing along the ground, before darting upward, in the direction the elven skull rests. The air is just slightly misty, a denser air, as Mr Bones materializes. Eyes peer about the forest, and despite the translucent paleness of his form, the expression of wonder, delight, nastalgia and sadness all cling to those angular features.

Rosalie smiles politely at the ghost, dropping a brief curtsey. "Greetings sir ... ummm ... I'm afraid I don't know your name. We were wondering if you could tell us how you would like to be buried." She hastens to clarify. "We want to do it properly; gift you with peace."

The attention shifts towards Rosalie, as the ghost is addressed. A sardonic, wane smile finds him. "Beneath an old tree, within this wondrous place. The elven rites given over me, by one of the People." Voice like the soft rustling of the wind, sweetened by an otherworldly compassion. Head canting toward Derleth, "Well you did to those unfortuantes at the place of pain. I saw them collected. They are releaved. At peace where they shall end up? I know not."

Rosalie smiles, visibly looking relieved. "We'll be honoured, sir." She tilts her head. "You recognized me before, sir, and called me by name. So I was wondering, sir, how you are related to Moonfinder Tarragonish. You've a little of the look of him ..."

Derleth answers only with a tenative smile...he's forging uncertain ground here, and he knows not if anything he says might disrupt the spell...if indeed, the spell caused the ghost to come at all.

"By business, by pleasure, by blood." The pause is so long, suspicions that is all that will be afforded from the question creep into the gathered. But before words are spoken, he continues. "Your father had associations of I. As well, joined was I with kin of his. A follower, an advocator of Labelas Enoreth, divine path walked. Time to he, to elves, is vast; enjoyed he the richness of mother yours. But finding remnants of time he was called, from threats of Drow. We met together, fought together. Parted ways, and I was lost. What of him? Know I not."

Rosalie bites her lip, looking back at Kyrel and Derleth. _Well, that helped. Now I have a whole new set of questions ..._ She pulls on her hair a little. "I thank thee sir, for the knowledge that he had friends. My mother spoke so little of him, and when she did, it alternated between grief and anger. Will you tell me, sir, your name, that I might share your fate with him when next we meet?"

"Arvailan Devos'Necarte," The ghost answers, simply. Before adding, "Moonfinder loved mother yours. It grieved him to leave, but God and Duty called. Decades he would have spent with her, as would any elf, but specially he."

Derleth wonders now, from how the ghost answers, if there is any limit to the questions that could be asked. It tempts him to ask the spirit about the mysterious gnome...but he has been dead so long, it is possible he would not know...even if he had been to this wood before.

Rosalie drops a second small curtsey. "Honoured I am to meet you, Arvailan Devos'Necarte. Would that he had grieved less, and spoken more. But that was his choice, and hers. Tell me, good sir, if you were in my shoes ... what would be the one question you would ask?" She smiles, biting her lip again. "You see, there's so much to ask, and I'm not sure which questions are the best ..."

+++Editor: Arvailan has been speaking Elven. Note that at the beginning of his arrival.

Arvailan is silent for a moment. If surprised, it doesn't register on those ethereal features. "You seem to be intent about your Father. And thus, I would ask how I might find him. And if so asked, I would answer that I know not where be he. Yet, in the city of Elneresk, there is a large temple to Labelas, as very much a museum to the Artifacts and items retrieved from Myth Dannor. They may have record of his most recent excavation. Also, there are Human groups who have dealings with the Church of Labelas; organizations for joint action, helping eachother search out relics of the Past."

Rosalie nods, slowly thinking about Arvailan's words. "So you would suggest I ask, not where he is, but where he was? Please, sir, will you tell us of these excavations? They are done for a museum, you say?" She whirls, to look at Kyrel. "Didn't we? The lady with the beautiful bird? She hunts artifacts!" Smiling happily, Rosalie turns back. "Please, sir, will you gift us with a tale of the museum? And ... " She throws a look at Derleth. "I know not how long this enchantment lasts, so let me thank you from the bottom of my heart, sir. You have gifted me richly."

Derleth just concentrates. He doesn't have any answers to give. And he wouldn't be surprised if all his effort if for naught, and the spell as more like knocking on a door, than a summoning.

A soft chuckle imparts from the ghost, purely, it seems, from Rosalie herself. "Your Father, I, and another lead a siege of the ruins to Myth Dannor once, to collect the remnants of a sword wielded by one of the most famous warriors against the forces that eventually felled that great city. There was much sneaking, demon-warding, and battle, but it was retrieved. Only we found a necklace to the maiden, herself, an item of great reverence to the bladesinger herself. Both are on display within the Temple, Moonfinder sited for the find of that paticular wrinkle of time."

Rosalie stands rapt, her eyes closed to aid the imagination. "It must have been grand ... grand ... Sneaking, battling, defeating demons ..." She sighs. "I shall remember the tale when I gaze upon the necklace and the sword."

"I have a question, myself," Arvailan prompts. "Where am I? What is this grand place?"

Derleth smiles a little. _So much for the spell._ "The High Forest, sirrah." he murmurs.

A ripple courses across the elf's face. Worry, distaste, venom. "There are Drow here. Above, below. Beware. Let not my remains be defiled by their eyes, let alone black touch. This I beseech."

Rosalie gazes around. "Is it not a wonderful forest, sir? Already we are wrapped in enchantment. We move to meet a stranger, who sneaks e'en better than I myself!" She twirls around. "And everywhere! Elves! Elves of all races ... We bring you, sir, to the wood elves. Think you you'll like it there?"

Kyrel says, "If not, we can take you on to Elneresk."

The earlier poison is releaved with a wistful smile. "Wild brothers and sisters, they, but blood of the People courses as much through veins of the Forest as it does that of mine..." After a moment, "Once, atleast." A quirk of his lips.

Rosalie grins. "And some day, sir, perhaps again. Will you travel with us, sir, or will you rest your bones until you reach your final resting place?"

"I shall once more return to the Eternal Dream of restlessness, good Rosalie, daughter of friend. This world I am in, it is waning to the very being."

Derleth glances up at Rose with a nod. "It's likely an effort for him to manifest. Undead manage it because they are powered by the Negative Plane."

Rosalie nods, dancing forward. She places her hand where the ghost's cheek would be, were he solid. "May your dreams be ever pleasant, Arvailan Devos'Necarte. May you meet your friends and loved ones, and may your enemies be far away. And may we someday ... someday meet again."

Derleth smiles to himself. _Unlikely. Arvandor is a paradise few elves would leave, even for a moment._

A smile, true, genuine, and warm graces him, despite the phantomness of that which is he. Up lifts one vaporous hand, and the briefest moment, Rosalie feels the touch, soft and gentle, drawing down between her eyes, over forehead, and into hair. "Like your father, you seem. Full of life and energy. May be you find him, and love him, for he you, all of your siblings. Be well, Rosalie Tarragonia, may Time's sand but part beneath your feet, rather then drift away on winds not of your own." He steps back, growing thinner in visibility, then gone, a soft, chill breeze flirting across the gathered.

Kyrel watches the shade vanish, then shakes himself and stands up again. "I suppose we should continue, then. The sooner we find the wood-elves, the better."

Silniya, who has been watching in quiet consideration, questions, "So, what was said?"

Rosalie looks ... bereft. _So little time. So little time. And so few clues ..._ She stares at the space where the ghost was, for some time, one hand cradling her hair. Then, she shakes herself. "Peace, Derleth. Let's gift him with peace as quick as e'er we can."

Derleth glances at the coffin. "Too bad we can't fit the coffin into Ky's back. We could travel faster if we didn't have the cart."

Kyrel repeats the conversation for the benefit of the ranger. "He did know Rosalie's father."

She nods, looking a little dissapointed. "I never had much relations with elves; never learned the tongue." A glance into the forest, "Though, I know the words of the Fey, the Forest, and I know the Wood elves here will understand it."

Derleth looks at Rose. "Don't tell me you're feeling your mortality, Rose. You'll live longer than any of us will, even Ky."

Rosalie grins lopsidedly at Derleth. "So I'll die a lonely old woman, long after my friends have passed on? 'Tis not a ... pleasant thing to think on."

Derleth bites his lip. "I'm sorry,I hadn't thought of it that way."

Silniya smiles weakly to Rose. "It speaks for itself, to find those like you, who won't be so easily felled. Fellow elves?"

Rosalie leans over, awkwardly half hugging Derleth's shoulder. "Few do. Few do. But for now we live." She reaches over and hugs Silniya too. "We live, and we love, and we dance." She smiles determinedly. "And when the circle of friends is wide it grows strong, and endures ..."

Kyrel says, "So.. we'll have families eventually, and you can be a friend of our lines. We'll manage something."

Silniya pats Rose on the side, smiling. "Well, let's just get moving, then, and let things move on, shall we?"

Derleth blushes at the affection. "Ah...yes, I think that might be best."

With the time taken with Arvailan, as well as managing the cart, it takes another day. However, the signs which were given in the letter are found, and Silniya has everyone put their weapons on the cart, before leading everyone in a hands-raised walk forward. "I smell them," She says quietly enough for the others to hear.

Derleth smiles wryly. "Let's hope they don't decide to shoot first and ask questions of our corpses. I have no desire to meet their 'black lightning' first hand."

Kyrel says, "Well, we're doing our best not to be threatening..."

Rosalie nods at Derleth. "Indeed." Her hands are still gloved, however, and only her short bow lies in the cart. And her daggers, but those barely count.

The sense of being watched is as thick as mud. And after a few moments, the party can spot glints of arrowheads within the foilage of the trees. Shadows seem to crawl along the forest, before their impressions can be spotted. Not fully emerged from the protection of the woods, the cover of the trees, almost purely glimpsed phantoms amid the trees. A little taller then Derleth, hairs of the seasons, reds, blacks, yellows, greens, and browns, eyes of dark shades regarding the group with a spectrum ranging from curiousity to restrained wrath. Silence.

Rosalie holds out her hands, down, and away from her sides. She turns around slowly, surveying the bushes. "Greetings,", she calls out in elvish. "We come to return a kinsmen."

Out from the surrounding groups seems to melt one who approaches. Hair of molten black held in a single braid down back, bedecked in armors of hide and leather, studs appearing to look like bone and horn. A javelin, fine-crafted, is gripped like a scepter as much as a weapon. Dark eyes fall on Rosalie, the speaker. "Kinsman?" Comes the question, a tip of his chin towards the box. "How did he fall?"

Kyrel says, "Ambushed by Drow."

Derleth remains quiet, being one of the only present with no elvish heritage at all. Besidesm it might distract the bowmen and cause them to twitch. _And I look horrible in feathers, especially when they're attached to arrows._

Several brows knit, in varying stages of worry, anger, or sorrow. Though stil, eyes are intent on the group, especially on Derleth and Silniya. The javelin-baring elf gives a small nod, two others breaking from their positions to cautiously approach the wagon. Carefully avoiding the group's weapons, the open the lid. "Bones," One calls down. The other reaches in, running fingers across the elf's remains. "With beeswax." The obvious leader looks towards Kyrel, unspokenly demanding an explination.

Derleth just keeps his hands in plain view. He doubts his association with the Lliaran clergy means squat. Though he tries not to laugh at the beeswax comment. _What an ignominius fate for a brave warrior._

Kyrel says, "We don't know all of the details, but they stuck his skeleton in a wax image, and imprisoned his spirit with a glyph-ward. We discovered what had happened when the glyph was damaged and his spirit escaped, and did what we could to comfort him... he wants to be buried with the rites of the People."

Kyrel says, "His name was Arvailan Devos'Necarte."

This relevation earns several visages of horror and rage, even the leader's eyes flicker with compassion and remorse. Once more a nod, and the two elves on the wagon begin unloading the coffin. Once more attention turned to Kyrel. "He is a Lunar brother?"

Rosalie nods, smiling sadly. "Kinsman, kinfriend. And now all I can gift him with is peace."

Kyrel says, "Aye. And a friend of this lady's father." He gestures to Rosalie.

There is a moment's pause, the leader looking over Rosalie a moment. The briefest ghost of a smile, merely the hintings one might possibly form on that face. A cant of his head, acknowledging Kyrel. "Our shamans will see he returns to the trees and sky." Another pause. "He thanks you."

Rosalie shakes her head. "Nay. We thank you. For doing what we ... could not."

Derleth breathes a sigh of relief that this is going well. He feels nervous, even alien, among the wood elves.

A simple nod. Silniya steps forward - mindfull of several bows raising at her - and imparts towards the leader a few brief words in an alien tongue, one high, fast, almost cheerful. His face darkens, as does a few, but a brief nod, returning equally. Then she recounts for him, "I told him of the Human presence in the forest. He knows of them; his people have seen them, but the humans are not harming the forest, nor anywhere near his people's lands. Their presence still itches all. His name is Raven."

Rosalie bows slightly. "Greetings, Raven. I am Rosalie Tarragonia."

Kyrel follows suit. "Kyrel Thalassian."

Silniya introduces herself in the tongue she shares with Raven. This earns a bit of surprise from those understanding, nervious, wary, or respective eyes turned toward Silniya.

Raven gives only a curt nod. "May the forest not rebel against you, for returning kin rightful." It would seem that's as much of a farewell that's given, as the others begin to move away, while still keeping watch.

Rosalie sighs, watching as Arvailan's body is carried away. "Go in peace, kinsman. Go in peace."

With that brief meeting taken care of, the four have nothing else but to just head back toward the meeting place assigned. Silniya, when asked what she told the elves, replies only that she gave them enough of a hint to her heritage that they recognised her. A half-day into the trip, there is a sense of... warmth, of someone watching over them, an air of contentment. The breeze is soft, as if hugging Rosalie. Another day, and they reach the spot. A clearing with a boulder off to one side, the trees alive with the chirpings of birds, scurring of animals. Kiri's rather annoyed that he has to stay not only close to Kyrel, but now to just go back into his hole. He likes the forest! Even if there are things that could eat him.

Kyrel says, "We'll let you out as soon as we can, Kiri. We have to see what this is all about."

Derleth's palms itch. He wants to know what this is about, but he's still not sure this fellow, whomever he is, can be trusted. If he'd thought of it, he would have asked his lady for an augury. For now, all he can do is be wary.

Silniya is pacing, before wandering toward the boulder. That is, until she stops, feeling the hair on the back of her neck rise. And, for a good reason, since something quite clear happens. The clearing is bathed in silence. As if in one, the birds, the animals, they go deathly quiet.

Rosalie sees the briefest of motions past the edge of the clearing.

Rosalie looks intently, trying to decide what that motion can be.

Rosalie catches movement, past the edge of the clearing. A whisp of green, a wrapped shadow. Nothing more.

Silniya quickly moves towards the others, breathing an immediate, "I _don't like this_."

Rosalie sighs. "Hello? We're here. We know you're here. Would you like your arrows back?"

Derleth taps Platinum's saddle. He feels Lliara's radiance protecting him from the protective spell he cast before hand...but he still feels exposed. He makes a shrugs to Sil that says 'neither do I'.

Kyrel says, "Games. I hate games."

Derleth smiles wryly. "Especially when you feel like a pawn in one." he comments.

"Not yet," Comes the flowing, almost musical voice. Stepping from the treeline with a casual, comfortably confident stride is a wood elf. A woman, just about as tall as Derleth. Hair the rich shade of leaves spills down to combat with thighs, while the elf's dress is like a vine, a breeze, and moss all in one, shades of orange and green, yellows and reds all drawn together. Her green eyes wide, expressive. "Glad to finally come face to face."

Kyrel exhales with a bit of relief. "Indeed. Why the run-around?"

Rosalie grins. "I give you greetings, lady. And I must admit, better to see you than to feel your gaze."

Derleth blinks. Of all the things he expected, she was not it. He remains quiet, for now.

Forward she draws, to hault before them, comfortably crossing arms upon her stomach. A dip of her head. "Quite." Smile bewitching, "Purely for formalities sake, allow me to introduce yourselves." Her head turns towards the ranger. "Silniya, of the Red Tooth." This puts Sil back on her heels. "Mother, a High Druid to the People of the Black Blood, father the unfortunate victim of a High Hunt." Those blazing eyes tilting towards Kyrel. "Kyrel Thalassian of Elneresk, Brother of Vane. Who is doing quite well, By the way; has his own tower in the Silver Marches."

Rosalie looks intently at the lady. _I like this ... not. I liked this little, and now I like it not at all._

Derleth stares. "You read us like an open book, clearly." he comments dryly.

Kyrel bows. "I'm glad to hear that, at least. But how do you know so much about us? Who are you?"

And down the line. "Rosalie Tarragonia. You're... Most interesting," She imparts with a wide, dazzling smile. "Especially your mother. Your brother is quite well, too. And Derleth..." She just looks at the cleric, without needing to say a word. "Quite the interesting bunch. I've been watching you since the Talonites." She casually draws away, walking toward the boulder, to draw atop it, crossing her legs. "Do you believe the Mill is the only one of her kind working for me?"

Kyrel grins, and makes an aside to his compatriots. "Told you so."

"Well, now that you mention it, no. If Gabriel is doing well, how does his ward fare?" Rosalie looks intently at the woman.

Derleth arches a brow..._She does not speak my surname. Could it be possible that she does not know as much about me as the others? I'm surprised the Mill could not find out easily who my father was..._

A dismissive gesture. "Alive, with him." As if shifting the discussion, "So, it's time we talk." A beconing gesture. "No need for me to call across, come here."

Silniya's hackles are still raised, her lips pursed, brows knit like a storm. But she silently moves towards the boulder, standing a pace or two away. She speaks a few words once more in that tongue, which earns absolutely no reaction from the wood elf.

Rosalie looks around the crossing, then shrugs. "Very well, lady. The floor is yours."

Kyrel approaches the boulder. "As he says. What do you want with us?"

"Let's be frank. You're here to look at portals. There's currently a problem, regarding portals."

Derleth purses his lips, and then dismounts and joins the others.

Kyrel says, "Oh?"

Rosalie says, "What kind of problem, lady?"

Derleth folds his arms. "That's what the Zhents implied, aye."

She nods, holding out each hand. "The Zhentarim," Indicating her left, "And the Eilistraeens." Opening her left hand, "The Zhentarim are here about the portal. You see, it's other end is in the Moonsea. A defensible spot, yes, but a large amount of the Eilistraeen guard is on the Forest's side. The Zhentarim want that portal. Considering how the Anauroch Desert lies between the High Forest and the Moonsea, bypassing the desert would allow them to smuggle much between Zhentil Keep and here, where it can be sent to their trading lanes, not to mention the surrouding cities along the Sword Coast." She opens her right hand. "The Eilistraeens protect the portal." To demonstrate, the woman claps.

++++Editor: after she first says Eilistraeens, she indicates her right hand.

Rosalie takes a brief moment to make a critical eye around. The only thing she notices is the fact that the inhabitants of the trees, birds animals and a like, have all their attention on the clearing's interior, paticularly that new guest.

Derleth understands the implications immediately. "Why not just destroy this end of the portal?"

Kyrel says, "It's not that easy. Portals bind a huge amount of magic and destroying them safely is difficult."

"The Eilistraeens are guarding it for not only a vow to Mystra by their god to help with protecting portals - rather then destroy them - while being a guardian to the surface from the Drow beneath the forest." She nods to Kyrel. "Not to mention that the dismantling of such a large magical source could be... unpleasant for the immediate area."

Derleth glances at Kyrel. "It would seem to be a safer solution. As powerful as the followers of the Dark Maiden might be, the Black Network can hurl a lot of resources at them, trying to take the portal."

"As can interloping adventurers, and other forces," Replies the elf with a crooked smile.

Derleth smiles wryly back at the woman. "We might, with some help, destroy the Zhent emplacement. But what after that? Do we stay here forever? The Zhentarim **will** send more. The portal would be worth a lot, to them."

Her attention shifts to Derleth. "Who said I wanted the Zhents to lose?"

Rosalie blinks. "You ... you serve the Zhentarim?"

Derleth's brow creases.

Kyrel says, "Technically, she hasn't said. Well, milady?"

Yet another dismissive gesture. "Serve is such a dirty word. No. Let's, for the time being, call it a cohabitance. As it is with the Eilistraeens."

Derleth's mind suddenly coalesces a possible answer. _The Zhents knew who we were because she told them._

Silniya stares at the elf for a moment. "You're speaking for the forest." "Absolutely," The elf replies, chuckling. "More like, I own it." Silniya frowns.

Rosalie says, "So what is it you want of us, oh overly informed and underly introduced lady?" Rosalie looks troubled, even angry. _How would father treat this lady, kinfolk though she be?_

Kyrel says, "_Own_ it?"

Derleth suspects then, that she is not an elf. _Elves would not speak of owning land. That's usually a human conceit._ And then his mind freezes up at a possible answer.

"Allow me to elaborate." Sitting up, "You are familiar with a Thieves Guild, yes? The Thieves Guild, within a city, has ties to the entire city. They control or watch every petty crime in the city. They influence what happens within the city, from politics to every day action." A slow smile. "I am that guild, and the head of it. The Zhentarim are on my territory. They are infringing on my land, and plan on setting up a smuggling, slaving, and fort on My watch. They are paying me, basicly, to allow them to do this. My weight holds strong with many of the inhabitance of this part of the forest. Monsters, humanoids, not to mention my own spies and assistants. The Eilistraeens want my business associates gone, not to mention hunt some of the creatures I have sway over. But they keep the Drow out of this forest, which I can appreciate."

Derleth does not speak, however. He does not wish to reeval his thought, and hopes the being cannot pluck it from his mind. He continues to remain silent, waiting for Rose's question to be answered.

Speaking bluntly, Rosalie looks at the woman. "So the Eilistraeeans and the Zhentarims are the two sides that you seek to keep in balance. And the Drow provide leverage that you do not like. And like the spider in the web, you hold the sides apart and yet together. Fascinating. Where do we come in? What price fo we pay, and what price are we offered?"

"As for you..." She clucks her tongue. "Let me ask you this. If you have a successful business deal about to happen, and then you discover that there is a person whom could let that possible deal fall through, by their mere presence and assistance, what would you do? Exterminate them, or offer them a business proposition yourself?"

Derleth snorts. "You want to pay us to leave, then."

Rosalie says, "You're making us an offer, then?"

With a sigh, the elf shakes her head towards Derleth. "Not quite." A nod to Rose. "Exactly."

Kyrel says, "Depends on whether they intended to cause trouble, and if they did, what their motives were - and how much trouble they'd be to deal with even if you wanted to. Though I fail to see how my interest in the Portals would tip the balance of power..."

Rosalie paces impatiently. "You dance and twist and turn and speak of offers. But as yet you have made none."

The elf looks flatly at Kyrel. "The Talonites. You, with some assistance with the Ilmaterians and Watch, flattened them. You put Foxmantle in jail - which annoyed the tar out of me, I might add - thus you have the mental prowess, as well as the fire power. You have no love for the Zhents. Now, why is it I would be worried if you sided with the Eilistraeens, a formitable force, here?"

After turning to regard Rosalie for a few moments, "All right. Here's the deal. Either you leave, you side with the Eilistraeens, and thus will have not only the Zhents aware of you, but Me and Mine... or you work for me. With proper initiating payment, of course. If you pay me, I will stay relatively out of the fight between the Zhents and Eilistraeens. You, then, become agents of Mine."

Kyrel just twitches an eyebrow. _And what, I wonder, was Foxmantle to you?_ "I really had no problem with the Zhents until they decided to make one. So, if we get involved... what would you want us to do?"

Rosalie blinks. "If we ... pay **you**? So we face retaliation, or steep fees. Lady, this is not a business proposition; it's an extortion demand."

Derleth looks at the others. "I don't think I care to work for someone that doesn't show their true face." But he says it conversationally, rather than as an outright unegociatable fact.

The smile that Derleth recieves is bittersweet. "You would not appreciate that," She comments, leaning forward to prop an elbow on a knee, cupping her chin. eyes flicking to Rose, "You say tomato, I say red vegitable. You face this forest and the Zhentarim coming down on you like a hailstorm, leaving as fast as equines will take you, or you pay me the entrance fee into working for me."

Derleth arches a brow. "Does this offer require an immediate answer?"

"Oh, and, don't think there's the fourth option of attempting to slay me. I have a ten foot longbow pointed at you," She comments casually.

The wind stirs, briefly. Silniya sniffs the air, while watching the Elf with steadily rising unease. Her fingers itch.

Rosalie hmmmms. "A tricky choice. I've always enjoyed a good frigid hail storm. Not quite as pleasant as a five day's blizzard, but refreshing, nonetheless. And perhaps I should mention the concept of a mutual detente? You have a long bow, I have my inimitable style, my dazzling wit, and the most frosty of sayings." She raises one eyebrow, smiling puckishly.

"I don't expect you to make rash decisions, Derleth of Waterdeep, Son of a powerful Merchant. But, I don't expect you to speak to the Eilistraeens about this, before decisions are met."

Derleth makes a small bow. "Touche, lady. You have a keen mind. It's a wonder that songs aren't written about you." he says meaningfully with a sardonic smile.

Kyrel says, "She probably doesn't let the bards do it. Secrecy is power, too."

A soft chuckle to the elf. "Exactly, Rosalie. Thus, why wouldn't I want you working for me?" Addressing Derleth with the sweetest expression. "The greatest strike is the one that people don't see coming."

Rosalie says, "So far, oh lady of the mighty long bow and the explicit threat, you have failed to name your price. Perhaps we could cut this long and undoubtedly fascinating - not to mention scintillating - conversation short? You obviously have a price selected; why not name it."

"Or, rather, the one they never even knew was delt."

Sharp green eyes lance to Rosalie. "Magic," She says, simply. "Or gold. A large sum, or something of definet power and capability. No potions of acid resistance here, nothing so useless and unneeded. I'll be blunt: I want power." A brow raising, "Do you have the power I can bet you do?"

Derleth chuckles wryly. "Our strength has never been measured in mere items, lady. I seriously doubt we would have something worthy enough for your eminence." He takes note of the green eyes.

Kyrel says, "As you intimated yourself. Subtlety is powerful in its own right, if one has the wit to use it."

Rosalie holds out both hands. "My power, oh lady of the secrets and the dark underbelly of the forest, is the power of of skill and the power of knowledge. What could one so poorly accoutred as I myself offer you? A mere trinket such as the one I carry on my finger? A paltry belt buckle that shields me from harm ... these surely cannot satisfy a lady whose appetite is as voracious as yours would seem to be ..."

Her smile is a silken dagger. "Then, I would think the first order of business would be finding something to accomidate what I want, wouldn't you?"

Derleth shakes his head. "No deal. I can't speak for the others, but between leaving and dealing with you, I pick leaving."

Rosalie shrugs. "Perhaps. Perhaps not." She sighs. "Someday you'll cease your dancing. Mayhap the winds will carry your steps forward then. Mayhap not. But as for me ... a price so nebulous you cannot even bring yourself to name it when urged is a price so expensive I've not the stomache to pay it."

Kyrel steeples his fingers together. "If it comes to that. But if you have followed our exploits, you should be aware that we could be quite a boost to your power if our motives coincided... and if they didn't, you could never trust us anyway, or vice versa. You have not told us yet what you would have us do as your agents."

Rosalie pauses, struck by a thought. Her eyes narrow. "And what proof have we, oh mysterious green eyed maiden, that your motives are more pure than those of the Talonites?"

Her hands spread. "I don't have a spesific, named use of you, as of yet. Consider the Harpers. They have agents who may be lax for several years, until orders are given. You could be like the Mill, whom I send my information to, and be her silent benefactor, while she gives me whatever I need. You could be spies, for me. Or continue to do your work, and send money back my way." Her head cants towards Rosalie. "Because I have no intentions of destroying humans. They are... curious things. I love to watch their little backstabbings and deals, and lives. Why would I wish to interfere with that? Control it behind the doors, under the cloaks of their superiors? Absolutely. Stomp it out, be a tyrant? Never. That would expose my presence, no doubt sending a horde of paladins atop me."

Derleth chuckles bitterly. "Are you really all that worried about that? The way I see it, you're likely deadly enough that your breath alone would deal death."

"You offer words, lady. Many words, and no proof. And we should naively follow where your words lead? I think that Derleth has the right of it; leaving is the just approach." Rosalie turns back towards her horse, gathering up the bridle and preparing to jump up into the saddle.

Those eyes intent on Derleth. "With one gesture I can administer death. Keep that breath for more useful measures." She watches Rose depart. "Well, then, fare the well."

"I only ask," She inquires, "Upon what proof is it you seek?"

Kyrel leans forward. "You can't guess? You insisted that we employ no spells of discernment before this meeting. We have no way of knowing whether you speak truth or not, even in the matter of what you would have us do as agents."

Rosalie looks down over her horse's withers. "Proof that your word is good. You offer us no name. You offer us a false appearance. You offer us threats and extortion. You speak of prices to pay, but decline to name those prices." Rosalie crosses her arms on the saddle. "And you are ... surprised that the reaction is not warm and fuzzy?"

Derleth goes back to Platinum. _Way I expect, it's all over but the shouting, so to speak._

She leans back, her hand falling to the boulder, fingers drumming. "I offer you not a set price because there are many things which I could be payed; no need to narrow it to a name. Artifacts, weapons of potent destruction, three thousand worth of gold, or gems. In other words, What do you want to give me? Iam flexible." A shift of her head, the hair swaying like a serpent along her back. "As for a name, you may call me Sessis."

Rose can feel her horse beneath her quietly trembling.

"You misunderstand, Sessis. I wish to give you nothing. It is you that wishes for payment. When a merchant haggles to make a sale, it is he who sets the first price." Rosalie shrugs, and pulls her haversack forward. "But let me start the bidding then. I offer you a harper's badge, and a deep blue gem." As she feels her horse tremble, she pats it awkwardly, trying to calm it.

Sessis's eyebrow raises. "You are a harper?"

Derleth shakes his head. "Rose, let us just depart, please. There's nothing to be gained by this."

The elf's lips purse. "All right. You wish for me to name a price? I shall. A task."

Rosalie smiles toothily. "I offer you a harper's badge, and a deep blue gem. In the haggle, do you not now offer a counter bid?" Then she turns to Derleth. "Yes, perhaps you're quite right."

++Switch those two.

Kyrel says, "A task. Now we have something to consider. What sort of task?"

Sitting up, "There is a crypt, three days travel north of here. Access to it is hard to achieve; a cave network. Within which is the remains of three people. The Archmage Kanlis, an archer by the name of Starbolt, and a priest of Lathander. It's warded, trapped, and... other complications. Within it, are several items I would like to either own, or have destroyed." Her brow arches. "Interested?"

Derleth shakes his head. "No thanks. My Lady's on good terms with the Morninglord, and I'd like things to stay that way."

Her smile is tired. "That's part of the point."

Kyrel says, "Continue... services are much more our coin than material goods."

A slow breath. "There are paticular wards which keep out those of, mm... Paticular auras of action?" A perk of a brow. "Many of my more... capable servants are unable to enter. Not to mention the whereabouts of this crypt were only recently uncovered to me." A glance towards Derleth, "And I seek to defile nothing of the Dawnbringer's."

"Part of the point, Ssessiss, is to sour the Lady's relations?" Rosalie pats her horse again, quieting her. "Are there any relations you would not see soured? Perhaps we could ... dispose of these items by removing them, and donating them to a museum? Kyrel, wouldn't that work?"

_We don't get them but neither do you. And I really would rather you didn't ..._ Rosalie soothes her horse as she considers the crypt ...

Sessis raises a hand. "A question, Rose. If you knew of a weapon that, say, could destroy your mother and her kin. Would you desire it's steady existance, or wish it dismantled?"

Rosalie tilts her head sideways. "If such a weapon existed, I would hope my mother did not antagonize those she planned on asking to retrieve it."

Derleth smiles grimly. _That clinches it._ He holds up a hand. "Wait a moment, Sessis. Clearly, tempers are running high. Let us take a night to consider what has been said here, yes?"

Fingers steeple. "I never said it was for my protection." Her brows knit. "Have we a-" Her head turns to Derleth. "Well then. Please."

Derleth smiles kindly, more so that he had before, and gestures to his companions. "let us away, and consider our options. Sessis, we will contact you by setting alite a fir tree as before, yes?"

"Very well," She replies, drawing off the boulder. "I will have an assistant watch for so." With that, she draws towards the edge of the clearing. Silniya, unsettled, is still staring at the boulder. A gesture from the ranger that Derleth approach..

Derleth comes to Sil's side. "Aye?" he says quietly in her ear.

The woman points. Upon the spot where notably Sessis was drumming her fingers, cracks have spiderwebbed through the surface of the boulder.

Derleth just smiles. "Come, love. You can play with rocks later." he murmurs, giving her a meaningful look that he's not as flippant as he seems.

Rosalie pulls her horse away. out of the clearing. "Aye, Derleth, you have the right of it. Silniya, didn't you see a likely camping spot, a short ways back?"

She just simply nods, and sooths her horse, urging it on. "Yes," She croaks, moving in the oposite direction as Sessis. Slowly, life seems to return to the trees, noise. As if the clearing itself breathed a sigh.

Derleth smiles. "She's clever. But her inner nature shows through. The question we must ask now is what we want to do." he comments to the others as they mount up.

SIlniya finds a proper place to leave the horses, before Kyrel calls up the Rope Trick. Easily shimmied inside, Kiri let loose to stretch his wings, Silniya immediately vouches, "She is no druid, no fey at all."

Kyrel asks, "What did you see at the boulder?"

Rosalie shakes her head. "And up to no good. She fair sets my teeth on edge. I'm sorry I lost my temper."

"It was cracked where she tapped it," Silniya says, shaking her head.

Derleth smiles. "It's questionable that she's a she at all, since she's already appeared as a male gnome..." He looks like a smug man with a secret.

Rosalie blinks at Derleth. "She's ... what?"

Silniya shakes her head. "This is not the gnome. That gnome didn't make my skin crawl with unnatural presence."

Derleth grins toothily at Rose. "Why, I'm surprised you couldn't tell yourself. I almost didn't pick up on it...right until I remembered something Sil said."

The ranger tips her head almost canine like at Derleth.

Kyrel says, "Oh?"

Rosalie looks unblinkingly at Derleth. "Do go on ..."

Derleth gestures. "Remember how she said she 'owned' the forest? At first, I thought to myself that only humans would have such a conceit. And then it occurred to me that one other such race would consider it so, as well...a race that looks at humans as play things, one that can shapeshift with ease, one that would have tremendous strength, and would desire things of power." He grins.

Derleth lays out the answer with a content smile. "Grimnosh."

Rosalie ahs. "That would explain ... she knows too much about mother. And it would also explain the instant dislike ..."

Silniya simply nods. "Either he's expanding his territory, or..." She shakes her head. "But that would explain it. Green dragons consider themselves the king of the forest. An emboidment of every aspect, much like a lion has it's place atop all other animals."

Derleth nods. "Why was everything so quiet? Why were the horses skittish? Dragonfear. The animals would sense it, even shapshifted. And she mentioned the possoiblity of a weapon that could harm your mother...and if she were a dragon, she would have reason to fear it as well."

Rosalie says, "Well in that case ... I feel no desire to give her the weapon. But my mother already wards the Talonite's former Child. Perhaps she can also guard the weapon?"

Kyrel says, "And they are certainly fond of considering us as lesser creatures who can provide amusement. Interesting... This would also explain the dislike of scrying spells, the ability to provide funding for a network of spies, and the disinterest in who wins the battle for the Portal."

Kyrel says, "I think you've got it."

Derleth shakes his head to Sil. "Remember the tales of the Purple Dragon? Once, the entire area taht Cormyr spans, and more, was his territory. I wouldn't be surprised if he always considered the High Forest as his. But because he doesn't want anyone knowing that he controls it secretly, the dragon itself keeps to only one section of it."

"But why would she send us after a weapon that could put her down?" Silniya inquires. "Obviously we're not at the best of terms. Bare your throat to your enemy like this?"

Derleth says, "Because, he feels save in his other identity. Remember what she said. Give it to her, or destroy it. Either way, it's not in a position to hurt her...him...it."

Kyrel says, "Either he thinks he's too clever for us to figure it out, or it's not an anti-dragon weapon that he's interested in."

Rosalie says, "Perhaps she's hoping we'll retrieve it before someone even less friendly does so. Can we appear to destroy it without doing so in truth?"

Derleth holds up a finger. "I actually have a thought, in that regard, Rose."

Rosalie ohs?

Silniya just shakes her head. "I would wonder why he would pose as a woman, though? And, not one riddle we were given, his signature."

Rosalie says, "But we were given many riddles. They just weren't clearly stated ... "

Derleth shakes his head. "Of course, Sil. If he gave riddles, that would give him away immediately. Everyone knows now that Grimnosh likes riddles."

Rosalie says, "So Derleth, you were saying, about the weapon ... ?"

Derleth says, "As I was about to say, I can ask Lliara for the power to plane shift us away, once we have the items. And when we are on another plane, we can return to our home plane in an area far away from the forest, thusly escaping our dragon host."

Kyrel says, "At least temporarily. How large is his territory? And how many Millers does he have in his employ?"

Rosalie says, "Can we return the weapon to the god to whom it belongs? Surely that would constitute destroying it?"

Derleth shrugs. "Why destroy it? It might be useful."

"Or doing worse then using it against Him, but then the clergy would use it against all of his kin?" Sil points out.

Rosalie says, "Surely the god can return it when it is needed once more?"

"Or perhaps ... we could offer to either her the weapon ... and then steal it back." Rosalie grins. "That, naturally, would be my preferred solution."

Silniya looks flatly at Rose. "You have any idea what kind of hell this forest will be, when she learns of this fact?"

Derleth says, "oh, come now. Why would Grimnosh raze the forest? That wouldn't help him any."

Kyrel says, "That's not what she means. She means that all of his creatures will be out for our blood."

Rosalie sighs. "This is one of those rare times when I dearly wish I could take counsel with mother."

Derleth nods. "Which is why we don't return to the forest. Once we're away, we get help to return elsewhere on the continent."

Silniya simply nods to Kyrel. "He's got his claws in many coffers, not to mention in the lives of most inhabitances of this forest. If it's Grimnosh, not just the Southern part, but nearly the whole damn thing."

Kyrel says, "Hmm. Maybe we should just leave. Take the first option."

Kyrel says, "What do we know of this dragon?"

Derleth says, "It would be the safest, Kyrel. But I get the impression my Lady would be dissapointed in me if I didn't dare do this."

Derleth says, "Anything that is known of the dragon, Kyrel, is suspect. He would not want knowledge of his true nature and strength in the open."

Kyrel says, "_I_ will be very disappointed with you if it gets us killed, too. In that case... play it straight, or do we double-cross the creature when we have this artifact? What do we know about Grimnosh?"

Rosalie says, "but do we really wish to pay for the dubious privilege of working for this Grimnosh?"

Derleth shakes his head. "I would not work for the dragon, for any amount of gold."

Silniya's lips purse. "Assuming this is Grimnosh."

Kyrel says, "Well... it's _something_ incredibly strong and capable of shape-shifting."

Derleth says, "perhaps it is not, Sil. But I still suspect it is a dragon. And Dragons need a lot of territory. I cannot see two sharing the forest...unless they are mates."

"It would be best to atleast find out if that is who we're dealing with. A dragon makes as much sense as water being wet," Sil returns, "But I don't want to go in thinking I'm fighting the Riddlemaster when we're dealing with a whole different wyrm."

Derleth shakes his head. "Which is why I'm not thinking of fighting her. Not yet, anyway. One of my thoughts was either to give the blade to a proxy of Lliara, or to...the Harpers."

Rosalie says, "How would the harpers satisfy her? Him? It?"

Derleth smiles. "They'd probably use it to kill her, actually. It's the sort of thing they'd do."

Derleth says, "And honestly, it would be in our best interest. We'd likely not be safe till she was dead, if we did this."

Rosalie ahs ... "Do they kill all dragons, or just the green ones?"

Derleth says, "The Harpers do not kill good dragons, if that's what you're asking. I suspect the Harpers might even have some Silver and Gold allies."

Silniya raises a brow. "I thought the Harpers were more spies with good intentions, not an army?"

Kyrel says, "Sounds kind of like us, doesn't it?"

Derleth shrugs at Sil. "The Harpers are meddlers. If we were to tell them of Sessis, I'm sure they would see the advantages of sending a small team in to...shift the balance of power."

Derleth says, "And, they are also far more likely to escape the dragon's notice."

Rosalie says, "So that rules out the chance of her letting us leave."

"Not to mention her Zhentarim 'Allies', who could not afford to lose her against the Eilistraeens?"

Derleth nods. "Exactly so."

Rosalie wouldn't mind sharing a few copies of a certain Zhentarish map with the Eilistraeeans.

Derleth purses his lips. "of course, before we do so, I'm going to need something first. And finding it might take some doing."

Silniya runs a hand through her hair. "So what's the word? Do we agree to go get these items? Go at her tooth and nail, paticularly with these weapons? Run?"

Kyrel says, "So do we leave for now, or go along with the task?"

Derleth says, "Those appear to be the options, Kyrel. I will do as the majority decides...though I admit, stealing an artifact out from under the nose of a powerful dragon would be...fun."

Derleth grins. "Not to mention daring."

Kyrel says, "You, my friend, have a truly disturbing idea of fun at times..."

Derleth shrugs. "What is life without risk? I don't gamble for my health."

Rosalie grins at Derleth. "A wonderful challenge. I'm all for it."

Kyrel says, "All right, then. Silniya, you in?"

Derleth glances at Sil. One word from her, and he'd drop the whole thing. And she can see that in his eyes.

IniziiGM takes a breath. "One question. Are we going to hand this whatever to some goodly force, to put a stop to her? Keep it ourselves? If we don't return with it, Sessis will think something's up. With the Zhentarim and everything from trolls to... other things on her side, anyone going in there when her alert is on high, is walking to their death. If this has the power to take her down, she will be as on edge as anything."

Rosalie says, "Personally, why not go all the way, and take her down?"

Rosalie says, "Assuming, of course, that the weapon really is that capable."

Derleth looks a little wry. "I'm not a coward, Sil...but someone that's not us might have a better chance at killing her. Of course...if my Lady asked it of me, I'd go all the way."

The ranger bites her lip. "Or, this could be a way of getting rid of us without endangering herself."

Derleth frowns. "You mean the tomb might be that lethal."

Kyrel says, "Certainly a possibility... depends on how clever she thinks she's being."

She nods. "Think. If the dragon is willing to take it's time to meet us, if we're that important to her, then obviously we are that much of a threat."

Derleth says, "We could always give it to one of Lliara's proxies. Which is why I'm planning to plane shift us to Brightwater, her realm. Since we can also likely find a way back home from there."

Kyrel says, "This ... might work. Shall we?"

Silniya nods. "I'm in."

Rosalie nods. "Me too."

Kyrel says, "Let's get a good night's sleep, then. I think we'll need it."

Derleth chuckles. "I'll agree to that."

"But, we should let her know our decision," Sil advises.

Derleth shrugs. "We can do that in the morning. It's what we said we'd do. let her sweat."

Rosalie says, "Why not tell her in the morning? Early enough ..."

Silniya shakes her head. "I'm nervous, is all."

Derleth moves to Sil's side, and kisses her cheek. "If you don't want to do this..." he says, trailing off suggestively.

Derleth looks down. "I love you. I won't do anything you don't want me to."

A dismissive gesture from the ranger. "No. I simply have a deep enough respect, and fear, of Dragons that I want to give them a wide berth. Playing Dragonslayer is not the risk I want..." The 'Unless' hangs in the air, her eyes on Derleth.

Derleth looks back up, feeling her eyes on him. "But?"

"I won't leave you to do it without me."
