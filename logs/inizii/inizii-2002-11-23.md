# Inizii 2002-11-23

Logfile from PL-Kyrel.

Derleth holds his crossbow tightly. "Wonder what else we're going to find, here..."

Rosalie holds a finger to her lips, signaling Derleth to keep it down, before heading back down the tunnel. There's guards need visiting ...

Rose slips up further, down the tunnel, heading toward the curve that would take her into the second chamber. She creeps around, seeing that the inward curve of the wall is carved into a semi-circled alcove... Which is empty.

Rosalie, at first annoyed, spots something... odd. There seems to be an indentation in the alchove; as if the wall yielded inward. A familiar voice creeps into Rosalie's mind, that of her little winged rat-torturer. _Hey. Behind you._

"Bloody hell!" Swinging her short sword in a high arc, Rosalie swings around.

Rosalie turns, her blade... catching air. Huh? Behind her, the false wall of the alcove explodes open, a squat, hulking figure leaping out at her back. Although a pure ambush, the woman's reflexes keep her surprise quite limited.

And reflexes prevail; she jerks out of the way just as a heavy blade cleaves the air inches from her shoulder. Her attacker half-jumps to the side, fully out of the view of everyone else down the tunnel, keeping cover from the wall's bend. To Rose's eyes, it looks like some hell-born apish bulldog. Taller then a dwarf by inches, broad as it is tall, the... thing is covered in greasy hair or dark, gnarly skin. Tusks rise from a wicked-barbed mouth, while powerful arms lead down to hands gripping the haft of some sword-like axe. It shows Rosalie a 'grin', which is teeth and grime.

Silniya, a frustrated sigh, rushes down the tunnel to swirve around where Rose stands, to let her eyes narrow. "Perfect."

In the oposite direction of the fight, the sound of boots thunders in some tunnel, approaching.

Derleth wishes at this point, he hadn't given up his Wall of Stone prayer for something else. _So if you can't have a wall of stone, have a wall of flesh._ He intonces cadences of summoning, calling from the forests of Arborea, a mighty celestial lion. As it shifts in, he commands it to attack the oncoming attackers.

The lion roars, as the sound approaches. Many growling, gutteral, almost 'inhuman' sounds errupt, and the lion simply tears down the hall. The one facing Silniya and Rose takes one look, before it simply snorts, and jumps back, before turning and surging down the second chamber, leaping over the creek, and peeling around the other corridor.

In the other direction, the lion lets loose a triumphant roar, accompanied by a pained one.

Derleth jerks his head at Kyrel. "We have some time. let's check on the others..."

Kyrel mutters unpleasant words as he pulls the lightning wand out of the Bag. "High Sentry, Kiri. Let me know where that little critter is, if you can." He sets himself to deal with the approaching guardians when they're clearly in view, but takes a step back in surprise when the Outsider appears and turns toward them as well. As the ambusher scurries off, he grins. "I don't think he wants to play."

Derleth runs down the way Sil and Rose went...

Kiri squeaks, chittering to Kyrel as he flits around.

Kyrel translates for his familiar. "He says the quasit's gone. What was that thing that jumped you, Rosalie?"

Rosalie looks back and then forward, before shrugging. Setting off at a fast run, she pursues her attacker, hoping to knock him out before he brings on reinforcements.

Derleth looks at Sil. "Go help Rose. Ky and I will check out the beasts fighting my summoned friend..."

Rose charges through the second chamber, and turns the bend, heading into the first. Apparently the stocky, thick legs don't aid the bulldog in speed; she's coming right down ontop of it.

Silniya spreads her swords helplessly, before following after Rose's course.

Rosalie swings her sword at the bulldog's back, midstride, slicing his shoulder slightly.

It grunts, and simply stops, turning around. A vicious, bloodthirsty look comes into it's eyes, while bellowing and snarling out a hellish tongue. Which is answered, though the voices a distance off; heavy, quick footsteps. Silniya comes in around the bend after Rose.

The shadows in the hall surrounding Derleth and Kyrel begin to melt. Stepping from them are a trio of elves, angular features drapped in the darkness of the tunnel, torchlight illuminating their tanned exteriours. Bat-wings peel from the murk around them, as they step forward, looking over the pair. The sounds of the lion's scrapes is getting bigger; more roars of mixed pain and anger, shouts of the bulldogs growing in numbers.

One of the demonic elves tips his head, peering at Kyrel curiously. "Greetings," He imparts in civil elvish.

Derleth hesitates a moment, but only because they do not immediately attack. He looks at Kyrel, as if he doesn't understand elvish...which, of course, he does. He lifts his crossbow a little higher.

Kyrel answers in the same tongue. "Good evening to you. Where are we?"

And Silniya leaps to the other side of the thing as the bulldog turns around, laying her swords into it with a swift hack into the creature's shoulder, scoring deep and earning a severe droop in the weapon, before her acidic shortsword drives into it's chest for a shallow, burning stab. It staggers back, wounds smoking with blackish blood, howling back over it's shoulder. The answers are getting louder...

Rosalie moves to flank the bulldog, catching him between Silniya's blade and her own. She swings the shortsword in a short arc, aiming for his hamstrings.

One of them smiles idly. "Somewhere you shouldn't."

Cutting both hamstrings in one fell swoop, Rosalie also manages to get both femoral arteries. Within moments the bulldog collapses, his blood pooled around him. "Damn!" She looks at Silniya, apologetically. "Back? Or shall we deal with the other dogs?"

In it's death-throes, the bulldog waves his blade around, bellowing a shriek of death that rattles the walls. "Not dogs," Sil says with a disgusted, almost fightful look, "Orcs." Now it sounds like the approaching entirge is nearly ontop of them.

The elves seem to be fanning out, moving casually into a surrounding position. "Come for it, have you?" The origional speaker inquires.

Rosalie grins, bloodlust spinning in her veins. "Shall we run, or shall we fight?"

"Rose," Sil replies, weaving her swords up, starting to back away, "I'm worried about leaving the others unattended..." "Oh, they're not unattended," Comments a voice from behind Rose and Silniya.

Rosalie turns on her heel, her eyes searching the darkness. "Right. Back it is." Settling into a comfortable lope, she heads back to where Kyrel and Derleth are ... are doing whatever they're doing.

Derleth feels naked being the only one between Kyrel and the elves. But they're getting ready, and it's clear what the outcome of this will be.

Kyrel smiles grimly. "Possibly. That would depend on what 'it' is, doesn't it? But I think this is going to become unpleasant."

Before Rose can make it back to Kyrel, there's an elf standing in her way, his wings spread openly. "They're taken care of," He assures with a warm, taunting smile. Behind Rose and Sil, the sound of 'rustling' greets their ears, amid the now plain grunts of the bulldogs. Silniya looks over her shoulder. "Um... Rose?"

Rosalie comes to a stop, her fingers on her belt. _Now would be an excellent time for a shield._ She speaks the command word to invoke the belt's powers. "Yes, Sil?"

A light chuckle delivered from one of the other elves. "Going? It was unpleasant to have Hellgate Keep disrupted. It was rather unpleasant to have the coordinaters destroyed or trapped or sent home. It was unpleasant dealing with the censoring field those wretched Gate crashers put up to keep us out. We're just... continuing the cycle of unpleasantness, you might say."

Silniya jerks a sword behind her, as indication. Three bulldogs stand, shield and sword-like axe in hand, grinning toothily. Between their triangular formation is another one, in bone-studded leathers, a thick, chitinous shield on his arm, and a spiked helmet. The most notible thing about him is, he's sitting astride a giant, thick-legged spider. The forelegs of the beast tap the ground anxiously.

Derleth shrugs. "Not our fault. Why look for trouble when there's none to be found?" _I don't like these odds, especially when I don't know what they're capable of...._

Derleth responds in elven as wel, seeing no point in pretending otherwise.

Rosalie oooohs, smiling happily. "Decisions, decisions. Do I take the threat in front of me first, or second? What do you think, Sil?" While she poses the question, she grips her shortsword carefully, thrusting at the creature in front of her as she finishes the question.

The third, unspoken one looks scrutinizingly at Derleth. "If there was none to be found, you wouldn't be here, I bargain."

Derleth snorts. "We're here for reasons that have nothing to do with you."

Kyrel says, "Actually, there's a lot of trouble. We're only here because we've got some Defilers to take out, and thought this could be of help. But somehow I don't think you're going to loan it to us...." He tightens his grip on the wand.

"Do tell," The first speaker coos. "If it has nothing to do with us, then well, we'll give you a fruit basket and send you on your merry way."

Derleth sighs. There's no point in verbal banter. "Right. Go suck on Lloth's tits." he spits, and shoots at the last to speak.

Rosalie's stab seems to have caught the Fey'Ari off guard. Her stab blasts through the demon elf's stomach, right up into it's midsection. A hellish Squeal excapes him, wings flapping franticly as spasmic ripples course up the demon's body, blood spurting from his lips, before he staggers off her weapon, wings curling over him. The lifeblood smokes as it hits the cool stone floor, while her victim sinks to the ground.

Derleth seems to have caught the origional speaker off guard. That civil tongue isn't going to be speaking much more; the quarrel catches him into the throat, sending wings flapping franticly, hands clawing at the killing bolt as he goes down. The other two instinctively step back, their eyes murder on the two between them. Down the corridor, the triumphant howling of the bulldogs floats down the tunnel; the lion must have been killed or it's time ran out, by now.

Silniya stares at the gutted Fey'ari but a second, before turning around, and lifting up her swords. Her body ripples, destorts, as the hybrid form comes forth. This earns a nervous gutteral canopy from the three triagular-formed orcs, but the spider-strider only nods his head once, and jerks his sword forward. A bellow that could only mean 'Charge' issues forth, before his men and the spider kick into a running surge.

Derleth blinks. _Wow. That was impressive. Wish I could take credit for it..._

The Fey'Ari let loose a slight hiss, now wary, especially of the two no doubt spellcasters. It seems as one their wings close, before snap open, a sickly sweep of pulsing energy bursting forth from them. Kyrel's lucky enough to dodge, but it hits Derleth squarely, a cold chill washing over him, leeching the blessings of Lliara, part of his strenght, part of Him.

Kyrel triggers the command word of the wand and a blue-white bolt of lightning leaps forth, pinning the winged elf between the mage and the wall.

The wand speaks, electric death lances forth. Although agility is on it's side, not being hit squarely in the chest, still the beast's wing gets caught, and the spastic jerk draws it back into the line of the bolt. A smoking boil of charred demon falls to the floor, as Kyrel's lightning blast skitters along the wall, lighting moisture clinging to it like a fire-fly convention.

Derleth is staggered as his life energy is stolen from him...doubled over in pain, trying to remain upright.

The bulldogs charge, their howling roar turning into a symphony of gleeful bloodlust. One breaks from the triangle, and guns for Rose, screaming in on her and sweeping his weapon, scoring a deep gash right across her back. The other two barrel nearly past Silniya, before turning to whip their blades over her. She parries one, and steps out of the way from the other. That is, before the Spider-strider, his mount charging in. Forelegs lift in a standoffish manner, before its fangs snap at Silniya, who deflects it easily. But it leaves her open for the rider's blade coming down in a crash onto Silniya's collarbone, the blade biting deep, and not going away. It earns a howl of pain from the woman.

Rosalie grunts, absorbing the blow. _Time to shift the shield around, I think._ Controlling the belt's shield, she now sets it to stand between her and the orcs. Meanwhile she swings her short sword, slicing into her foe. Blood spurts, but dammit, he's not down. And Silniya needs help!

SIlniya snarls... and simply leaps forward, ignoring the demonic orcs on her sides. She sends her blades in a fierce weaving sweep, cleaving right across the spider's eyes, her sword nearly getting stuck, while the second cleaves right into the top of the beast's head. Longsword popping back, she attempts a slash at the mounted rider, but has it cast aside. However, he looks utterly pissed, as his mount begins to sink to the floor, legs curling beneath it.

Derleth grunts, sliding a new blessed bolt into place. _Down, but not out._ he thinks, praying as he takes aim at the last elf that his last attack wasn't just a lucky shot. He pulls the trigger...

The last Fey'Ari was skulking toward Derleth, what looks like a sword weaved of shadow starting to form in his hand. That is, before Derleth comes up and plants the quarrel squarely in the Fey'Ari's gut. Light, pure and simple, blossoms like a scalding starburst from the wound, the holy bolt making flesh ripple as it burns. The demonic elf shrieks and struggles, pawing at the quarrel, as its body starts to smoke and evaporate.

Kyrel grins at the cleric. "They don't seem to care for Light, do they? Better go see what's keeping Silniya and Rosalie... I'll take the rearguard and zap anything that comes around the corner."

Derleth does not take the time to rest on hius laurels, nodding to Kyrel's comment as he loads a third of his remaining quarrels and dashes to the aid of his comrades...

Kyrel moves more slowly down the corridor, watching back the way the celestial lion had gone.

Rosalie's attacker merely grunts, and plows forward... to bump into some resistance. A shake of his head, a snarl, and he leaps back, before surging forward, and bouncing downward to sweep his sword low at Rose's feet. The axe chops straight into the side of her leg, and the woman's twisting reflexes keep it's momentum from cracking bone. Sil is worse off, but better. The two raging fiendish orcs seem to move in the same motion, their swords scaring seperate wounds over her flanks... which simply close back up. This certainly earns some worrisome grunts, dispelled once their 'commander' brings his own around, hacking into Sil's torso with an overhead cut. Not deadly, thankfully she eased back with it, as well as took some force out of it with her shortsword. He jerks his head towards Rosalie, barking an order. The two pull away from Silniya, turning their glaring attention at the remaining woman.

Rosalie tumbles forward, past the fellow attacking her. Silniya looks wounded, and in sore need of assistance. Perhaps a little distraction ... Stepping behind the commander, Rosalie swings her sword over her head, and spearing him in the back. When he doesn't collapse, she swears, making sure that the shieldis pointed towards him and his henchmen.

The leader of the three twists and grunts in pain around the blade in his ribs, turning toward Rose... and Silniya lays into him. A chop into his midsection, a skewering that runs up his side, her final blow a bone-shattering drop from the hilt of her sword onto the tusker's plated forehead. His body seems to rupture in boiling contents, as he stares up at the two flanking bringers of Death... and seems to nod in respect, as life drains from the glaring, bloody eyes. The other three take a small pause, at this development... and all three begin to run. Any fear that they might get reinforcements, however, is quelled once their howls are met with the sounds of oncoming bulldogs.

Silniya sways over the slain captain, snarling out, "I think... We should start moving..."

Rosalie nods at Silniya, a hand fumbling into her pouch. "Unless Derleth gets here quickly, dirnk this." She holds out a healing draught. "Lean on me, and we'll rejoing Derleth?"

Derleth abruptly shows up with his crossbow in hand. "What happened?" he queries, still feeling a bit of weakness.

Silniya wipes the blood off her snout, the grimy bile staining her fur. A deep chuckle. "YOu look worse off then I do," She replies to Rose, before turning to Derleth. A gesture to the dead spider and its rider. "Trouble. C'mon. I hear more coming. We need to move, now."

Rosalie shrugs, lightly. "We ran into a few more ... bulldogs. Or orcs, if you prefer. But Silniya took the brunt of it. She could use a little help, Derleth." She stops, to take stock of her own wounds. "As could I."

Kyrel doesn't see anyone coming. Either they know he's waiting with spells, or they've relocated elsewhere; the barking howls have lessened.

Derleth hangs his crossbow on his weapons belt, takes stock, and lays his hands on the more seriously wounded Rose first, knowing how hardy his love is...

Silniya wipes her sword clean, and simply starts towards Kyrel's location. "Damned Tanarukk."

Derleth blinks solemnly at Rose. "Where do we run to, however? back to the river?"

Rosalie examines the captain, quickly, for obvious pouches, before follows Silniya, carefully cleaning her blade. "I think, for now, I'm going to run after Silniya. Coming?"

Derleth looks wry. "The Lady provides, but only fools trust on her to the exclusion of all else." He follows.

Kyrel is waiting at the next bend. "I think they decided discretion was the better part of valor. Shall we finish our mission?"

Rosalie nods. "I killed one funny looking elf. What was he, and are we going to encounter more?"

Kyrel says, "I suspect they were those 'darkwings' that the minotaur mentioned. They died easily enough, so I'm not going to worry too much about them."

Rosalie looks around. "On second thought, I see you already have." She chants under her breath, looking the corpses over carefully.

Derleth looks at the others. "Let's discuss it later. Should we press on to the tomb, hoping to find sanctuary there?"

Kyrel says, "They reacted very badly to blessed crossbow bolts. Almost as if they were undead of some sort. But lightning works just as well."

Silniya nods. "Onward, then."

Rosalie says, "In that case, Derleth, how hard is it to bless a few arrows?"

Rosalie nods. "Just a sec. Anyone object if I gather their pouches, at least?" As she asks, she's already slicing the pouches off the belts. And she's carrying the orc's axe, too. And she humming very softly, a wide grin on her face.

Kyrel grins. "Just don't take _too_ long at it."

Derleth looks wry. "Easy. If I had the spells. But I had no idea that these elf-things were vulnerable to that, so I didn't prepare any."

Rosalie shrugs. "Right; I'll just keep to the short sword, then, and you can shoot over my shoulder." She hefts the axe. "I do so like finding magical weapons." She looks down the tunnel. "Ready when you are. Which way shall we go?"

A glance at the map, as they keep moving. The map is marked that after the S-curve which they just exited, there's a three way juncture just ahead, which taking the left tunnel should lead, with a twist and turn or two, to the entrance of the Crypt.

Kyrel peers at the map. "Should be ... that way."

++Editor: Switch those.

Derleth sighs. "lets go, then, and hope getting into the crypt won't take too much of Her favor."

They head down the tunnel, finding the remnants of Derleth's summoned lion. Apparently, it took a few with it; a Fey'Ari looks to have been taken apart, and atleast a half-dozen Tanarukk are mutilated beyond recognition. And a lot more blood; apparently the heavenly cat left some with a little pain.

Derleth grimaces. "Ugly things."

Derleth kneels briefly, murmuring a benediction to the celetial creature that he sent into certain death.

From the other two tunnels, the gutteral tones are echoing, the clang of weapons. They're not coming, just yet, it sounds like. This seems to send the four on a quicker trip down the tunnel, their passage growing steadily deeper into the earth. A corkscrew of a tunnel downward, the Tanarukk's following resounding off the walls. Keeping their safe distance, it seems. No traps have been found yet. The tunnel opens into a chamber, at it's center an altar. Upon the alter, an enormous stone serpent is coiled, its head turned toward the opening maw of the Crypt; juts like teeth hang over the opening of the Crypt.

Kyrel murmurs the cantrip to detect the presence of magic, and winces as he looks at the stone serpent. "Strong magic, there. Don't know what it does just yet, but...."

Rose spots something, that looks like grooves along the sides of the Crypt's opening. The opening itself looks as though it was once sealed, but the doors blasted through, stone melted to form a jagged hole leading into a different structure then the cave chamber around it.

Rosalie says, "I don't know, either. And I smell a nasty nasty trap. I wonder ... there's grooves here, but ..." She takes a few steps forward, cautiously. "If it's a trap, there must be a way to disable it."

Echos of the Tanarukk's approach gets louder.

Rose takes a few moments of serious scrutiny over the situation. There seems to be a well concealed cable that goes from the base of the Altar into the ground.

Rosalie ah-hahs, under her breath. _Step one ... inform the party._ She points the cable out, carefully. _Step two ... disarm the trap._ "Actually, ummm, if you could all back up a little? I think I should try disarming this beastie first."

Kyrel says, "Transmutation on the serpent. I'll bet it comes to life. Be careful, Rose." He backs off at her request, turning to cover the entrance to the room with his wand.

Derleth hears the approach of the enemy, looking slightly nervous, both by thier approach, and by Rose's comment.

Derleth looks at Ky. "I can close the entrance, but that leaves us without an escape."

Derleth says, "Should I risk it?"

Rosalie shakes her head at Derleth. "Not yet." She moves forward, cautiously, stepping over the cable, carefully searching for a way to disable the trap.

Kyrel thinks about it for a long moment. "We can always teleport out if we have to. If things go bad, it's an option, but unless the critters are nastier than they've been so far, it's not worth the trouble, I suspect."

Derleth says, "it's not a case of being nastier, Kyrel. Even kobolds could take us down in sufficient numbers."

Derleth says, "Besides, it's not much of an exit if it leads straight to the enemy."

Derleth says, "And I could always unshape the rock, give a day to repetition for the prayer."

Rosalie says, "Won't we run out of air by then?"

Kyrel says, "Not inside a rope trick, we wouldn't..."

Rosalie ahs. "What a handy skill ..."

Derleth grumbles. "Fuck. Well, here goes nothing." He places his hands on the rock floor, and, praying to his goddess, bends the rock to his will, molding it to reform over the entrance, preventing any from getting out...or in.

Rose looks over the foundation, and starts towards it, before pausing. A look back to the crypt's mouth. Judging from those downward juts, the 'teeth' around the crypt's opening, and the grooves, it's likely a porticullus. Something she does, though she doesn't know what, will trigger the porticullus lowering. The best way to disarm the trap, atleast to not get it to close, would be to jam it. Something large and clunky, unbreakbale holding it open, or wedging something into the groove.

Rosalie looks at the axe in her hands. She looks at the portcullis. She looks at the axe ...

_Damn; this axe is too short. Now if we could fix those grooves ..._ Rosalie turns back to Derleth. "You know that stone shaping spell you were mentioning?" Could you use it to flatten those grooves, instead?"

Rosalie notices the stoned wall as she turns. "On second thought, we need a new plan." She looks at the grooves. "That portcullis will drop. I can hold it up while we go through, I think."

Derleth looks wry. "I'd have known that, I would have saved the spell."

Rosalie shrugs. "We were concentrating on different problems. Mind the cable here. Or ... " She bites her lip, as she examines the cable more closely. "I wonder if the cable lowers the portcullis."

Kyrel looks. "It might hold the portcullis up, for that matter..."

Rosalie turns to look at the trap one more time. "Well, keep your rope trick handy, in case this fails." With that, she picks up the axe and steps forward very slowly and cautiously, stepping over the cable and eyeing the portcullis.

Rose starts towards the Porticullus, moving quick. The faint sound of stone grinding greets the party's ears, then the snake's head turns slowly toward her. Dust clouds upwards as the coils begin to flex, shift... and a horrid shriek of stone enters the air; the snake's motions earn a 'click' from the altar. This is repeated at the mouth of the Crypt; those jagged points above the opening jerk downward, showing the grating. Working quick, she darts forwards, rolling to get her there faster, build the momentum, and stabs outward. Enough strenght, momentum, and sheer Luck earns that steel to slide into the groove, wedging between Porticullus and stone. The weapon begins to quiver, as gears churn under the stone. Meanwhile, the snake is starting to uncoil...

Rosalie holds the axe in place with one hand, and turns to watch the serpent. "Right; anyone want to guess how sharp a serpent's tooth is? Or shall we all dart on through?"

Derleth doesn't even quip. He runs.

Kyrel nods. "Let's go!" He starts running toward the opening, trying to get through before the snake either completely animates or the axe gives way.

Silniya charges forward, letting the others get past, as the snake starts to ease off the altar, a rattling, earth-grating 'hiss' echoing, as it starts to slide forward. Sil nods to Rose, before ducking into the entrance of the Crypt...

Rosalie ducks under the portcullis, still watching the snake, and ponders pulling out the axe. _I wonder if I can lift the gate myself ... if I can, we can lower the gate._ She places both hands on the gate, lifting upwards experimentally ...

Derleth and Kyrel dive into the front room first, and a slight 'click' resounds under Derleth's foot, before a jut in the wall thrusts a rusty spear into his side. The snake is getting closer, it's head starting to wave back and forth, marble eyes focused on Rose.

Rose discovers he cannot.

Derleth collapses to his knees, and holds up a hand to Kyrel not to move further, not knowing what traps lay beyond as he pulls the spear free, muttering something about Beshaba's offspring.

Silniya barks in alarm, and moves to Derleth, haulting only at his warning..

Rosalie swears under her breath. "Damn gate, damn snake, damn trap, damncrypt, damn axe!" She pulls the axe out, letting the portcullis drop. Then she swings around, and stares intently at the room. "Traps are like rabbits, I swear they breed."

The entrance of the crypt seems like an alchove. This opens up into a small hall, black paint covering the walls, though white flecks shine through it. The ceiling is filled with lots of holes; all seeming natural.

Derleth looks wry. "Fortunately, I'm not hurt bad."

The snake lwoers its head, staring at them through the grate. It doesn't try to burst through, however, even though there's little doubt it could if so designed.

Rose spots a tripwire, eight feet into the hall.

Rosalie looks back at the snake. "Silniya, can you watch the snake?" Then she moves forward, examining the tripwire. Pulling out her tools, she selects a small cable cutter and carefully snips the wire. Then she looks around again, in case she missed a second less obvious trap. Or rather, a third ...

Silniya watches the snake. Which, the animated serpent seems to be fine where it is. However, her ears tilt towards the ceiling.

Rosalie's snip seems successful, and no traps appear immediate... But something does catch her ears. The brief scraping, a light shuffle above her. Recent memory recollects the spider's walk.

Rosalie stares intently up. "I think we're going to see more spiders, friends. How did you say the other winged elves arrived?"

Derleth blinks as he bandages his wound. "Just down the hall, was all..."

Derleth pulls his flail free from it's hangar, the square heads clinking against each other...

Silniya draws up, her swords ready. "Right. Well, the snake looks like it is content for the moment." She looks back to Derleth. "Are you okay?"

Rosalie shrugs, dropping the axe and pulling out her sword, before moving deeper into the room. She looks everywhere, hoping to spot the traps, or the enemies, before they spot her.

The walls are dark, cracked, looking painted over. However, as the torch passes over them, one can get the impression there were... letters on the walls, before painted over. Some of them wern't so well covered.

Derleth smiles at Sil. "Rusty spears are hazardous to your health, but I'm fine, love."

As Rose inspects it, it seems to be common symbol for 'E'.

The hall that the four are in looks rather barren... Though, something catches Rose's eye. It's by the archway into the next room; something half obscured by a cloak.

Rosalie holds up a hand, and then points at ... at the cloak? She steps forward, to challenge the cloak, and its wearer, her sword held ready to strike.

Derleth purses his lips, leaving his crossbow at his side for now as he comes alongside Rose...

Kyrel says, "Someone's been here...."

Derleth hmmphs. "Maybe..."

The cloak is covering something, but it looks in no good condition; torn in places, rotting... Doesn't smell good either.

Rosalie nods, as she hunkers down, using the tip of her sword to lift the cloak up. Under her breath, she starts chanting her old favourite cantrip.

Derleth says, "Then again, that cloak looks like it could have been in here a long time."

The cloak is hard to pull up. Rose fights to unearth it, and it comes loose, a long, sticky line pealing off... the corpse beneath. Little more then the remains of a skeleton, which is simply Stuck to the floor. Some greenish substance keeps it sealed. Whatever happened to the person doesn't look pleasant; both shoulders and the upper ribs of one side are crushed, the front of the skull **scarred**, jaw cracked in several places.

The bones also look like they've been partially melted, around the glue's hold.

Rosalie drops the cloak again, and stands up. "Well ... any idea what could have caused that, gentlemen?"

Silniya simply shakes her head.

Kyrel says, "Never heard of anything like this. Doesn't look very pleasant, whatever it was."

Everyone but Rose hears something, from somewhere beyond the darkness of the archway. A light 'chirp' sound. Like some malevolent cricket...

Silniya lifts her swords. "So... It seems we can do nothing but head forward..."

Kiri clings to Kyrel's shoulder, squeaking.

Rosalie nods at Silniya. "Just let me check out the archway." She steps forward, carefully eyeing the archway for traps.

Kyrel nods to his familiar. "I don't think I like that sound either. Is it a bat, or is it really an insect?"

Derleth chuckles wryly. "If it is, Kiri can have it."

Derleth takes a moment, then, to heal Silniya, just in case.

Kyrel says, "Kiri says it's a giant insect. Well, he said _big food_."

Rosalie steps through the archway, still looking around intently. This is definitely not the time or place to relax.

Rose peeers past the archway into the room beyond... And, it's just as well. The ceiling is caked in spiderwebs, like some morbid curtain. A large hole looms in the center of the ceiling.

Sil's wounds close slowly, the woman giving a brief nod to Derleth in appreciation. "What do we have, Rose?"

Rosalie says, "Spiders. Lots of spiders. Wheeee. Hey Kyrel, don't spider webs burn really well?"

Kyrel nods. "I believe they do, yes. Shall we?"

Rosalie nods. "Light a spare torch? I can throw it in."

Rose, peering around, staring at the hole, notices atleast something... Two foreward legs of a spider, lumbering near the lip of it. There's a brief motion inside, the glint of a blade? The move of an arm? Something.

Derleth tilts his head to look after Rose. "See anything?"

Rosalie nods at Derleth, staring intently at the archway. "I need some flame **now**!"

Kyrel fishes a replacement torch from the Bag and spends a bit of time getting it to light. When the **click** of the flint and steel finally gives way to the crackle of flame, he passes it up. "What's so urgent?"

And then Rose hears it, as the torch is passed to her: spellcasting. The walls around the group start to bubble, to move, and then it's realized; the walls aren't moving, only what's on them... And the hall explodes into a thick, ugly cloud of stinging, biting flies.

Rosalie growls, moving past the archway, and pushes the torch at the spiderwebs, trying to set as many alight as possible.

Kyrel swears in alarm even as Kiri dives for his protected pocket, and moves forward while summoning up Burning hands to drive away the insects.

From either upper corner of the room, above Rose, there's a brief, chittering hiss... and she sees it: two thick, sticky woads of Whatever flying at her. They fly at her, and just is she agile enough to move out of the way, those globs sticking to the floor in viscous splatters. The corners of the walls erupt in motion; wings flapping as angular, curvy bodies blast down toward her. Like a Mantis from hell, black chitine filled with jagged edges, shiny bodies that gleam against her torchlight, the glow playing like possessed children amid the multi-faceted eyes.
