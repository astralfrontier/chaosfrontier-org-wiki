# Inizii 2002-11-30

Silniya snarls, from within the storm, waving her weapons abound. Although the petty insects don't much bother her, she tears off the cloak from the victim, throwing it over Derleth's head, before bursting out into the room beyond. A stare up at the dive-bombing mantids, and reminds herself to get a ranged weapon she can take advantage of, later.

Derleth was in the middle of forming a plan when he ended up with a rotting cloak over his head. Peeking out, he regains his bearings and somersaults into the rom, out of the range of the insects. The words forming in his mind, he weaves his hands as he intones the sacred syllables, and then reaches out and touches Silniya's leg, who ends up feeling a tingle as the spell takes effect. "To protect you from the webs." he explains a moment later.

Rosalie moves deeper into the room, using Silniya's advance to cloak her own movements as she advances on one of the hunters. Her sword snaps out, digging into the hunter from behind.

As Rose's shortsword digs into the chitinous armor, the blood within sprays outward in an arc, hitting Rose right in the face. It burns, gnawing corrosively at her skin, hissing holes into her cloths.

Kyrel backs up, as the swarm takes hold of the hallway before him; luckily he was further enough down the hall to not get caught. The fire explodes forth, cutting into the swarm and parting them like butter. The mage runs through the tunnel, into the open room.

The one on Rose's other side blazes down, the pincers slashing in a downward snap, looking to catch her in the thorny vice. Partially stumbling from the burning blood, or reflexes, either saves her as she moves out of the way. The mantis hisses and clicks the relative butcher's cutlery of its fangs.

It would seem bad luck is on both of their sides; the other attemps to assault Silniya from above, but swordpoints parry the hugging claws. Up in the hole, the sounds of spellcasting echos, before gossamer strands unravel from the very air itself; at a huge slant, from the ceiling down to the floor, at an angle to grab the intruders, while the mantids hovering above aren't caught in it at all.

The multi-layered mass of web forms, though everyone seems agile enough to move away. Though, it's still covering much of the floor, and at a sharp angle. From the ceiling, the spider emerges, lokoing like some twisted rendition of a taur. Instead of a head, up rises the upper body of a drow, nastily carved swords held in hand, as it begins moving down the web.

Derleth stares. He's never seen a drider before, though he's heard the tales of the half-men, half-spider creatures changed by Lloth's faithful...

Sil moves through the strands like a ghost. She snarls up at the insect assaulting her, and moves between herself and Derleth, before lancing her swords up at it's underside.

Sliniya's assault into the mantid proves viciously effective. A slash deep into it's underbelly, a stab, before she returns to hack at a leg. The first tip off this was a bad idea is when the corrosive material of her blade does... absolutely nothing. Before the pressurized blood splashes down at her. It sizzles the webs around like water, the werewoman dodging, but that leg which was nearly hacked apart sends a gout across her back, earning a howling squal.

Derleth is frozen breifly in indecision...the drider is the paramount threat, but Acid is dangerous, even to a werewolf...finally, he reacts, touching his lady love again lightly as he calls forth a second enchantment. A black energy briefly envelops Silniya, surrounding her like a skin tight barrier before fading from the naked eye. _That should take care of the acid._ he thinks briefly as he gets to his feet...

_With a little luck, spider boy will not be impervious to cold. I hope._ Rosalie takes a deep breath, and expels a mighty gust of cold air upwards, angling her head to catch both insects and drider.

The room is caught in a moment of intense cold, the blast erupting and washing over them. Frozen crystals hang like icy daggers from the web. The insect above Rosalie, the one yet untouched, shrieks a chittering sound, clacking it's mandibles together in anger, bobbing in the air. The one which she and Silniya had been wittling down barely moves, the joints and cuts holding frozen ice, the wings barely moving... before the frozen chitine cracks in several places, upon it's downward fall, acid exploding in all directions from it, parting the web partially. Silniya is uneffected, and Rose thankfully dodges the blast. While it didn't seem to phase the drider too much, the attention now seems on Rosalie.

The mantid above Silniya seems still effected by her frosty breath, shuddering and even the attacks from it are missed. The head shakes in frustration, wings beat faster as it backs up, moving to hover over Derleth, poising above him, the thing relatively 'Grinning' with the cutlery of it's mouth.

The drider reaches back, slapping the sword against a coating of webbing along the back of it's abdomin, sticking the sword to it. Clicking, hissing muttering comes from it, as it speeds down the web towards Rosalie. Magic weeps off it's hand, before it snaps clawed fingers toward her.

THe spell goes off as the Drider touches Rosalie in the throat. Wounds begin to spring up all over her body, the energies of her form simply syphoned from her. Meanwhile, the wounds the cold had inflicted melt away, the drider's mandible-laden mouth clicks with delight, as it's healed quite efficently. Almost as if it 'thanks' Rose, who staggers back from the leeching powers.

Kyrel shakes his head, having been momentarily swayed, before his hands snap one, two, into the motions of a quick spell. Claiming a small rod of amber, fingers lash towards the Drider. Electricity crackles, blazes on his finger tips, before lancing out in a beam of screaming death, frying webbing and slamming into the Drider's side as it passes.

The lightning earns some shaking from the spider-fiend, it jerking and twitching, almost jumping on the strands of webbing, before spitting out a curse when the electric jolts ease from it's form.

Silniya wheels around, looking from Drider to Mantis. Either she help Derleth, who's the obvious next victim, or she deal with the Drider, that's plaguing Rosalie. On one side, Rose is hurt, and the Drider is baring down on her. Not to mention she's surronded by webs. On the other, she has protection from the Mantid's acid, and it's after Derleth... After a firm decision, she launches herself snarling at the Mantid.

The first, a chop into the mantid's Mid-section, cleaving, before her shortsword drives right under it. The spray of acid does nothing, but her next attack is forted by a pincer moved in the right time.

With Silniya distracting the mantis, Der moves through the webs, in an attempt to flank the drider and aid Rose...but the webs prove stronger than his resolve, and he gets mired in them before he can get very far.

Growling at the drider, and the boils on her skin, Rosalie touches the torch to web, hoping the heat will overcome the warmth. As the flames catch, she slowly retreats a few feet, looking for distance, and takes up a defensive posture.

Kyrel takes stock that Silniya has the insect well in hand. Even though it's near him, the more worry is the Drider. His hands snap back and forth, calling up the arcane blitzkreg that is the darting blazes of magical energy which slam repeatedly into the Drider's form. It hisses and waves its' sword, clicking, pointing at the mage. The mantid's head swivels, flying away from Silniya's assault, before attacking Kyrel full on.

The mantid's pincers come down like a hailstorm, one snatching Kyrel by the shoulder, barbs squeezing into him, while the other snaps across his midsection. In an angry hiss, the mandibles are brought to bare, taking a slicing to the mage's shoulder and jaw. The Drider watches Rosalie a moment, before attention shifts to Derleth, trapped and helpless in the web. A click of the mandibles, and it moves to him slowly, chuckling horridly. Two front legs come forward, to wrap around Derleth's shoulders, before its' head snaps forward in a bite.

Derleth twitches, and dips his head downward, the Drider hitting its face rather bluntly on his helmet.

Derleth is breathing heavy, muttering a sutra to his Lady for that bit of luck...

Silniya looks to Derleth in the grips of the Drider, but Kyrel twitches more in the Mantid's grip. "Rose! Help him!" She calsl, before hurling herself at the back of the hunter's body.

Her initial attacks seem fruitful; the mantid's body weaves back and forth, back legs 'kicking' Silniya, nearly pushing her back. But she slashes with her shortsword near the wings' bace, earning a shudder, the thing dropping into the webbing as wings fail. However, it keeps the death-grip with Kyrel none the less, even moreso, as it looks bloody and near death allerady.

Derleth bares his teeth at the Drider he breaks free from it's mandibles...but he's still not going anywhere, webbed up as he is. So, he pulls a dagger from his boot. "Go suck on Lloth's tits." he spits, having liked his success the last time he used that epithet...and it's also quite appropriate. He lunges with the small blade.

Derleth's knife stabs into the stomach of the Drow's uper half. It doesn't skewer it, but earns enough for the Drider to get startled, to lurch off him. His second jab is reduced by the web's cling, making it shorter then it should, as the Drider moves out of the way.

Kyrel twists and pulls inside the grip of the Mantid. Then something comes to mind. "Sil! Poke it in the eye!" Which, out of startlement, she does; and it distracts the Mantis enough, that Kyrel can get a spell off. His body changes, molding into the likeness of a spider the size of a cat, before darting under the Mantis, and into the webbing.

Rosalie growls deep in her throat as she steps forward. Her short sword disappears from sight as her lips lift away from her teeth. Pouncing forward, canines aim for the driders throat, while claws swipe at his body.

Rosalie damn near does it, too. This surprises the thing, her bite taking a vicious chunk from the Drider's throat, while one hand digs into the dagger point Der made, ripping it open. The Drider squeals and pulls back and forth, before shoving Rosalie off, bleeding badly.

Derleth doubletakes...at first, he's just grateful for the save. And then he realizes the manner in which Rose attacked the thing. And all he can think of is: _Drider must taste awful._

The Drider moves back up the web, farther up then Rose can move without climbing, with much of the strands in her way. A pained, chittering voice excapes it, before jerking fingers at her. A black void forms, before waving outward in a pulse towards the woman's form, rifting the air in a tide of dark pain. She dodges it, before it crackles at the stone floor beneath. The drider continues inching up the web, away from the savage woman.

Silniya turns around, snarling, moving towards Derleth and beginning to hack at the webbing holding him in place. She makes note of the Drider's bite wounds, of the blood on Rosalie's face and hands, and merely nods. Not bad, not bad at all.

_Kill the damn spider man! Kill the spider man! Don't make me bite him again!_ Rosalie looks meaningfully at Derleth. Particularly the dagger he's holding.

Derleth does not hesitate as he takes a second dagger from his other boot. "Give greetings to Sevetlarm, foul thing." he says direly, throwing his daggers at the retreating drider...

The Drider hisses, opening it's mandibles wide, the twisted, elven mouth beneath gaping to show the fangs, poison dripping from mandibles. It hisses, rattling off something... and the dagger point goes right into the gaping mouth. This it didn't see, the fangs clicking over the dagger's hilt, while blood wells in a black surge from around the blade. It hisses and sputters, sinking and clawing at the webs. The legs begin to curl up under it, as the web sinks around the Drider.

Kyrel becomes himself, on the other side of the web, near the door out of the room. The courtain of summoned gossamer hangs over part of the room.

Silniya simply nods in satisfaction. "Let's get through here." She begins hacking through the webbing, looking behind her. "Rose? A bit of help?"

Rosalie watches the creatue fall, her eyes narrowed. She spits, to the side. "Foul tasting fiend!" Then she stops, her face relaxing slightly, her hands relaxing, no longer claws. She turns to watch Silniya for a moment, confused, before shaking her head. "Certainly." First, she clears a path to Derleth, and taps him on the shoulder. "Shall I uncork a potion, healer, or can you be of assistance?" She sways a little, as she asks.

Derleth moves sluggishly through the webs, looking at the dead drider. He eyes the dagger in its mouth distastefully. "You can keep it." he informs the corpse as he retrieves the dagger that missed.

Derleth turns, looking concernedly at the acid scorched form of Rosalie. "Coming." he grunts, and lays a soothing hand on her face and belly...

Derleth also takes a moment to tend to his own wounds, after Rose starts to feel better.

Rosalie straightens, a light blush covering her cheeks. After a gruff "Thank you", she turns away, clearing the webbing. She concentrates on the drider first. Magic users like to keep tools handy. As she clears the web, she chants under her breath, looking for magical items.

The drider's abdomen is covered with webbing, materials like dead insect husks, or a human eye. She does find a flask of acid, two javelins stuck to its' back, and a potion, by the looks of it.

Rosalie straightens up, eyeing the flask and the potion, before turning to Derleth. "These, I think, are for you. Or Kyrel." The javelins she eyes, curiously, before putting them in her quiver. There's plenty room for them there.

Derleth smiles at Rose at her thanks...and then catches the blush out of the corner of his eye. For a moment, he wonders, and then dismisses it as nothing important.

They eventually make it through the webbing. The other side of the room has an archway leading outward. About that time, the web's duration ends, dropping the drider and the acidic mantid's corpse to the ground.

Rosalie turns to look at the room one last time, her eyes narrowed. Just in case she's missed something. A few gems, a small statue, some gew gaws, anything like that ...

Derleth taps his chin. "I wonder..."

Rosalie hmmmms in Derleth's direction?

Silniya comes forward, leaning on her sword. A shake of her head. "That wasn't fun..."

Derleth says, "Well, I somehow doubt the Drider and those insect things were the crypts guardians. And if they weren't, how'd they get in?"

Kyrel clears his throat, and gestures to the wounds on his person.

Rosalie looks up. "The ceiling?"

Derleth says, "Yeah, but we're underground, in a rock cave. maybe through one of those air vents?"

Rosalie turns to look at Kyrel, and smiles crookedly. "Ah, yes, Derleth ..." She fumbles at her belt, pulling out a healing potion. "Will you need this?"

Derleth moves to Kyrel's side. "Sorry old boy. No, no, Rose, I'm not out of magic yet..."

Derleth's spell heals Kyrel's aches and pains; thankfully the polymorphing magic closed up some of the wounds with its transformational properties. Silniya looks at the hole in the ceiling. "Well, didn't they say there was something that kept Evil out of the outer sanctum? So, maybe we're not there yet, and these are here."

Kyrel shifts back to his normal form as soon as the drider and its allies are defeated. "I'd have to agree. They can't have been the only defenders. Let's just continue... cautiously."

Rosalie nods at Kyrel, and looks at the doorway. "I think it's time I checked for traps again."

Silniya looks over her shoulder at the dead insect. "The other is likely too wounded to attack again. Good, that."

Derleth chuckles. "After that last close encounter with a rusty spear...yeah."

Kyrel persuades his reluctant familiar to come out again. _No more giant food, Kiri. It's time to come out again._

Kiri chirrups, and flutters out, shaking his head. He mutters bad things about food that attacks.

Rose serveys the hall beyond. Certain cracks and holes in the ceiling suggest a drop off. There's a pressure plate on the ground, which is soundly disarmed as a small spike is driven beneath it.

Rosalie narrows her eyes, looking down the hallway one last time. Thenshe cautiously moves forward, searching out the next trap.

Derleth looks back at the others. "It's nice to have our own trapmistress again." he comment idly.

No other complications appear in the way, this time. However, another archway is ahead.

Rosalie looks back at Derleth's comment, one eyebrow arched high. "Indeed, Derleth. Whereas I appreciate the chance to fight in concert with Silniya. Not to mention the health benefits." She looks forward at the archway, trying to see what lies beyond.

Yet another one Rosalie finds. This one appears to be a harmless pit trap, by the weaknening of the floor, found with prodding from her sword. The archway leads into a slight hall that opens into the next room, so the pit's doors take up the entire hall, a good four feet long.

Derleth chuckles. "Yes well, I have nothing against using my skills for a valued member of the group."

Rosalie smiles over her shoulder, as she points out the trap. "How is your healer's kit, Derleth? I don't think we've encountered the last of our enemies yet."

She attempts to disarm the pit, but the doors simply fall away, before her, opening up to the yawning darkness beneath. However, the pit isn't wide enough that it can't be lept over.

Rosalie sighs. "Gentlemen, I think we're jumping. Who has a rope handy?"

Kyrel stays toward the back of the little group, watching the way they've come in case anyone is following. He negotiates the pit easily, taking to the air for a moment by use of magic.

Rosalie jumps after Kyrel, taking a short run to soar over the pit.

As Rosalie hits the ground on the other side of the pit, a familiar sound enters her ears. Click. The sound all thieves fear. A bar whips too fast for her to see, from around the side of the wall, slamming into her chest and pitching her backwards into the pit.

Rosalie pitches backwards, and twists her body to avoid the blades lining the pits' walls. Her ring activates, as she plunges, slowing her descent to a crawl.

Rosalie cries out, swearing loudly. "Merde! Merde! Kyrel?"

Derleth says, "Fuck. You don't need my healing kit already, do you?" He comes to the edge of the pit, looknig over.

Kyrel spins as Rosalie cries out at the thudding impact. He's back over the pit as soon as the bar is out of his way and drops down to where Rose is drifting downward. "Hang on, then." Between his flight boots and her ring, he can easily lift her out and past harm's way. "That sounded moderately painful. You all right?"

Rosalie grins, ruefully. "Sometimes the mistress gets the trap, and sometimes ... Yeah, I'm fine." She stares at the bar. "If you set me down on the lip here, I can take a stab at disabling it. Permanently."

Silniya moves to the pit's edge, shaking her head. "Check and see if there's any more traps to jumping over."

Derleth chuckles at Rose. "At least you're not skewered."

Rosalie says, "I'm looking, I'm looking. Just ... stay where you are? And Kyrel, thanks."

Rose dismantles the bar, tearing into the mechanism,, scarring the gears to make it snap out whip fast.

Rosalie searches, with a little more determination, this time. The next doorway leads into a spiralling stairwell. The walls are covered in smoothed out grooves, and she finds two traps, one at the beginning, a flaming-oil projecter, and half way down, a simple spear trap. Though, at the bottom, she finds another. This one harder to disarm; her first attempt, she knows, failed.

Derleth is merely quiet, wondering what will be ahead, if they are not in the heart of the crypt...and what will happen if they have to fight guardians of good alignment.

Rosalie turns back to look at the rest of the party. "Hold back a few moments before you descend the staircase. This last one is proving ... intransigent." She mutters something under her breath about paranoid bastards, and tries to disable the last trap again.

Again, she fails. It would seem the plate's mechanism is pretty dang hard to get up under; simply jamming the sides of the steps doesn't do it.

Rosalie growls under her breath, and pulls out a piece of chalk. She draws a large X on the step above the pressure plate, and on the walls next to the plate. Then she walks back up to the top. "There's a trap down there I can't disable. In part because the entire floor looks trapped." She growls, frustrated. "I've marked the step above it with chalk, so we can avoid the first pressure plate. Any suggestions?"

Silniya considers. "Exactly how many steps is it from the pressure to the next room?"

Rosalie says, "About three. And then there are big, obvious wards on the door frame. Perhaps Kyrel or Derleth should take a look; see if they recognize them."

After a second, Silniya asks, "Does anyone have anything rather large and clunky?"

"And heavy, too."

Derleth scratches his neck ."I can look, but Ky's the big arcane scholar."

Rosalie says, "We could go back and manhandle one of those corpses. Or grab the orcish axe ..."

Silniya shakes her head. "No, no, something roughly round."

Kyrel says, "I don't have to touch the ground, either. Let's see what we've got...." He floats over the last few stairs and looks at the wards.

Rosalie turns to look, curious, at Silniya. "What did you have in mind?"

Sil grins. "Well, we get a nice big rock or something, throw it down the stairwell, it triggers the trap, then we just walk in after it."

Derleth says, "Nice idea...but only if the trap doesn't make it impossible to get in."

Rosalie ahs. "Well ... that might work. Or Kyrel could float down and just drop the body ..."

Rosalie bites her lip. "I'm just ... not entirely certain how to disable this trap. But ... I think I'd like to join Kyrel, and take another look. Wait here?"

Kyrel descerns that the wards are Protection from Evil glyphs. Very powerful ones. They effectively keep out anything evil. Which is obvious, because the rest of the room beyond looks like it had been repeatedly spell-blasted, likely from annoyance by anyone not able to get in.

Rosalie grins at Kyrel. "Well, those shouldn't do us any harm, right?"

Kyrel says, "Interesting. I don't think these wards will bother us in the least. They're barriers to Evil. All we have to do is get past the floor. Any luck, Rosalie?"

Rosalie hmmmms, looking at the floor. "Whatever it is, it looks as though it's set up to attack us. I wonder ..." She eyes the floor carefully, looking for places where weapons might emerge. "Do we have any stone shaping abilities left? Or any other useful spells? I can try disarming the trap again, but ..." She shrugs, looking helpless.

Derleth shakes his head. "Sorry. If I'd have thought of it, I would have. Hell, the portcullis and the stone snake probably would have done better at keeping the Fey'Ari away than the entrace I closed off." he looks wry.

Rosalie smiles up at Derleth. "No worries; we didn't know what the snake would do."

Kyrel says, "It seemed like a good idea at the time. We'll just have to do the best we can. I don't want to take any longer than we have to, but if we need to stay and replenish magic, we can."

Rosalie eyes the trap again. She notices that the top of the stairwell, right behind the archway, is covered in some material to hide it. But she notices it immediately: a bar, with protruding blades. Its covered with gunk to keep the blades from shining, and a torch light or magic glow wouldn't show it, but her darksight picks it up easily. The trap wound glide down the grooves, before starting to rotate, faster as it went down the stairwell. Getting a boost from Silniya, she wedges a rock between the bar and the groove.

Derleth says, "We'd probably be safer replenishing magic beyond the wards, though."

Rosalie looks once more at the groove. "That should do it. Derleth, I'm going to test that the trap is disabled. Please, all off you, stay off the staircase?"

Kyrel nods and heads back to the top. "Good luck. If you know what it's doing, you should be able to dodge it even if it doesn't hold."

Derleth chuckles. "Don't have to tell us twice, Rose. Lady smile on you."

Rosalie moves down the steps, and presses her foot upon the step. There's a rumble underfoot, and a sound of gears creaking at the top, but nothing. She jumps up and down on the bottom of the stairway, but nothing. The next room looks like nothing except blasted viciously by spells. However, there are two stone double doors leading into the next room. In the center of them is a quarts-stone. Written upon the doors in common, "Pure heart's water must bless the stone."

Rosalie calls the party down. "Room's clear. And I think this is a good place to rest, too." She moves towards the doors, examining them carefully. _Especially if we hide in a rope trick._

Kyrel follows the stairway down, though he jumps over the pressure plate rather than step on it. He looks around the next room curiously. "Pure heart's water must bless this stone? Does that mean holy water, blood, or are we supposed to pee on it?"

Derleth eyes the writing when he comes forward, and then rolls his eyes at Kyrel. "What an interesting idea. Do you want to test it by giving it your own personal rinse?"

Rosalie tilts her head at Kyrel. "Well, we could do all three. But, truth be told, I don't think I'm pure enough ..."

Kyrel says, "I think we should start with holy water, myself. Let Derleth handle it."

Silniya changes back to her human appearance, lifting her hands. "I may have a wolf inside me, but don't expect me to mark my territory on a wall."

Derleth looks back at Sil. "There's a story to tell. 'We were in a crypt, seeking a powerful relic. And there was a trap there that, in order to disarm it, we had to pee on it.' What a riveting tale. Maybe we can get that bard to write a song about it."

Rosalie shakes her head at Derleth, and lifts her lips slightly. "Or maybe not."

Derleth chuckles. "Well, worth a shot, anyway." He gets out one of his vials of holy water, and pours it on the stone.

Rosalie glares at Derleth. "Would it not be better if we rested **first**?"

Kyrel says, "Too late now. I don't think we're in bad shape, come to that..."

Rosalie suddenly turns beetred. "Or is it that you don't trust me, Derleth?"

The holywater splashes onto the stone, but surprisingly, it does not run off into the floor. A small pulse of light emits from within the stone, the water absorbed into it. But the doors do not open. Kyrel takes note of some wards along the walls, which have bled through the scorchmarks.

Derleth winces. "I'm sorry, you said to do it...I assumed you meant now."

Derleth says, "Hmm. It didn't seem to work. So either it's not holy water...or it requires water specifically blessed by Lathander."

Rosalie shrugs morosely, looking anywhere but at Derleth. "Doesn't matter, I'm sure."

He descerns they are the symbols of Dimensional Anchor. Essentially keeping anything from teleporting, plane shifting, or any other form of magical travel in or out past this point. Whatever has to exit, has to exit through here.

Derleth looks confused. "What? I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to imply I don't trust you...though I can't imagine why you'd think that..."

Rosalie blushes more intently. "It's ... it's nothing. Absolutely nothing. I ... no. Doesn't matter." She turns to look at the doorways, her body posture suggesting she's desperately hoping to find another trap. _I've never ... never lost control like that before. What if ... They wouldn't ask me to leave, would they?_

Kyrel says, "Interesting... and annoying. Once we figure out how to get past it, we're going to need to make it back to this point to 'port out again."

Silniya walks forward, pulling up her leathers enough to expose her side a little. Briefly cutting herself with the short blade, enough blood is smeared onto her hand. "Let's try this..." She reaches forward, rubbing the red liquid over the stone. Another pulse, the crimson liquid rolling over the stone, before once more absorbed inward. Small symbols blaze along the stone, before the doors swing open.

Rosalie eagerly steps up to the door, intently looking for more traps.

Kyrel looks stunned. "Bozhemoi. I didn't really think it would take blood to do it."

Derleth still looks confused, but is distracted by Silniya's action. "Hey now...you could have warned us..." he chides Sil. He bandages her self-inflicted wound.

Derleth murmurs quietly to Sil. "Do you have any idea what Rose is going on about?"

Kyrel notes the symbols that flash in the darkness as the barrier is broken. "They really had that sealed. Nothing could have gotten past easily without the correct action."

The room beyond isn't lavish, but the walls are relatively clean, albeit dusty. The next room is long. At the end, is a statue of a Hound Archon, looking relatively glower. There seems to be no door, however.

Rosalie steps into each room, eyes intent on traps. Under her breath, she chants once more, since the traps are now likely to be magical.

Silniya simply nods to Derleth, muttering back, "I have an idea."

Derleth arches a brow. "Does taht mean you're not going to tell me?"

The statue glows. Silniya snorts at Derleth. "Later."

Derleth holds up his hands peacably. "Very well."

Behind them, the stone doors slowly move closed. However, the quarts stone seems large enough that it appears on the other side, too. If one needs to get out, just complete the ritual again.

Her eyes narrowing at the Hound Archon, Rosalie calls for Kyrel. After all, he's the one who knows about these things ... She points out the glowing hound archon. "I rather suspect this hound, like the snake, will animate if we come too close."

Kyrel preps the cantrip again, looking around the chamber to see what types of magic are present.

Its head lifts. Lips begin to move, as an unearthy voice speaks.

Derleth uhohs. "Too late."

Kyrel shushes the cleric. "Listen."

"_The closed portal glimmers not, the open portal gleams_

_What passes through this oval portal passes into dreams._

_Open every dawning, closing every dusk,_

_Naught that passes through here does the wise man trust._"

Rosalie turns to look at Kyrel, hoping he can explain this one. Because she doesn't trust **anything** coming through this door.

Kyrel waits for the voice to finish. "Riddles. Multiple portals, the open one's lit, the closed one isn't. Illusions, I think the last line means. Open at dawn, close at dusk, seems obvious enough."

Nothing happens.

Rosalie says, "But how can doors down here detect sunlight?"

Derleth says, "What about the 'passes into dreams' part?"

Silniya considers, tapping the hilt of her sword, while looking over the statue.

Derleth drums his fingers on his armor. "And if there are portals, where are they?"

Kyrel says, "All good questions. I don't know about 'passes into dreams'... my guess is that if you try to step through a deactivated portal, you vanish permanently. As to where, or how they know what time it is...?"

He shrugs.

Silniya frowns. "What if it has nothing to do with magic at all? What if it's something very simple? Like a window?"

Kyrel says, "Maybe there's three portals... in that case, avoid the oval one."

Rosalie looks around the room, hoping for a clue.

Derleth says, "Maybe they're hidden? Rose, could you try and see if there's any hidden switches?"

Silniya shakes her head. "Maybe we're supposed to answer the riddle, instead of looking for some way out of here... What opens at morning, and closes at dusk?"

Kyrel says, "Hmm... flowers, sometimes. What else...?"

Derleth scratches his chin. "Eyes, maybe? They certainly wouldn't gleam if they were closed...and then open at daybreak when we wak up, and close when we sleep..."

Kyrel nods. "Could be. I was just thinking the same thing. And you're not supposed to believe everything you see."

Derleth says, "And it is an oval portal..."

Dust rises from the idol as it steps forward, unsheathing the stone sword on its back. Turning around, it strikes the wall near the ceiling, and the wall parts in a narrow doorway.

Rosalie says, "But eyes aren't oval ..."

Derleth blinks. "Whoah."

Rosalie says, "or then again, maybe they are."

Derleth chuckles. "Well, eyes, maybe not...but their sockets are."

Kyrel chuckles. "The eyes have it. Let's go."

Derleth winces. "Bad joke, mage. Very bad. I may have to hurt you."

Rosalie steps forward to the portal, her eyes disproving the riddle, as they're pressed almost closed in fine slits. "Would a hound trap a doorway?"

Derleth says, "it's a statue, Rose. I don't think it's intelligent. But, take a look."

Rosalie shrugs. "Looks clean. Shall we?"

Derleth grins. "If the lady says it's safe..."

"The ... lady", Rosalie turns back to grin weakly at Derleth, " thinks it's as safe as it's going to get."

Kyrel says, "Technically, she says it's not trapped. That'll have to do."

Derleth smiles. "Your word is good enough for me." he says. Innocently enough, but it's as if he's trying to make up for whatever hurt he might have unknowingly caused.
