# billoneshot

Relaxing. Certainly reassuring. And here, Quarrel had been under the impression he was going to be harrassed. Perhaps not all the humans abound are as bad as their reputation, and a very large chunk of them seem to be. An appreciative gesture to the serving girl, a sip to the glass is taken. Brows raise. "Bitter," He comments to the glass, but takes a second swallow. The aches and pains of travels can grow numb, from this.

One glass of the stuff seems to be more than enough, from the dizziness and the spinning...

About twenty minutes later, a group of six men come in and pick up the body of an unconscious Elf who stumbled into town. The serving girl looks on as they cart this poor figure away, a guilty look on her pretty young face...

Bill says, "..yep. Sucks to be you, rolling a 6 on a Fort save."

The sound of men jeering, of money changing hands, and the growl of some sort of beast is the next thing you're aware of, thanks to the helpful wake-up call from a bucket of water dumped overhead.

Quarrel spits, sputters, and sits upright, head pounding. Ugh. What **was** that? Boiled mushroom broth? His head feels like the hoof of an ox on a rampage. A hand rubs his forehead. Quickly, he glances around.

"Fifteen on the Elf!" "You've got a cask of ale for a brain, Jerbold!" "Gimme 20..!" "He won't last a minute!" "Bet he'll last longer than your front teeth!"

Quarrel jerks his head up, looking around, before trying to hop up on his feet... if able.

The cage is perhaps fifteen to twenty feet to a side, and at least twenty-five high - or rather, the enclosure is that high, while the bars of the cage itself stretch up at ten feet from the rock surface. It's underground, at least, with guttering torches and men crammed into every possible inch of observable space around the cage above. Yelling down at you, they seem excited as bets are placed, punches are landed and a general rollicking free-for-all is had. The sound of growling grows louder.

Quarrel, if he were feline, would lay back his ears. Even though he's quite elven, there's nothing elegant and graceful about the snarl on his face. Surprised, he is, at having everything. Starting to slowly take his cloak off, the growling gets his attention... he looks about, quick.

One massive slab of iron, it seems, serves as the lower door to the cage. Attached to a chain, it's being lifted out of its position as obstacle to what is now clearly a doorway. And beyond that doorway is whatever's causing the room-shaking growl, a beast of which only the paws are immediately visible. Its size must be enormous!

The door slides all the way up, held in place by stout chain, and what's behind it can only be described as a dog - but what a beast! It's a massive creature, with teeth that look ready to seize a head between them and worry at it until removed. The beast itself is as tall as a man, or nearly, easily slinking under the 10-foot span of the doorway and halfway into the cage.

Quarrel swallows. All right, this is not good, no. Now, if he were one with nature, the elf would seek to council with this beast, perhaps. Be one with it, calm it. However, he is not truelly focused on the balance. And, in his learning, nature takes what nature wants. Resistance, however, is doable. He crouches, doing two things. First, unhooking the mace from his belt, and keeping it in one hand. The other, he unsheaths the dagger, staring at the beast. By the sound of the crowd, and the animal itself, this is pretty much to the death. Best to hit it before it gets close.

As the crowd's chanting rises to a fever pitch, "FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!", the dog growls its own intentions and advances.

Quarrel, despite the jeering of the crowd, isn't going to rush up and try to bash it's head in. No. That will put him right up close, too soon. So the elf is crouched, his cloak around him. Outward, in his left hand, the mace, it's well crafted head tapping on the cold floor. Held close to his body, is the dagger, however, poised. He's waiting until the beast gets closer, until he has a clear shot. When it moves within his weapon's reach, the left arm swings open, as the right one snaps up, spinning the weapon.

The beast roars in pain, snapping with its own powerful jaws in an attempt to take off the hand that caused it such distress.

Behind the dog, as blood spurts into the air from a sharp gash in one arm, a long tunnel is visible - the creature wasn't simply caged here, but was perhaps allowed to roam freely. The tunnels look natural, not man-made, and perhaps offer a way out, should a battle not suceed.

Quarrel cries out, the stinging bite moving deep into his arm. He moves back... and bumps into the cage's wall, having been cornered rather quickly. All right. There is a balance, of serenity, and of chaos. Pleasure, and pain. The inner magics, or the roaring forces of the nature, they come crashing up, filling the elf's limbs with strenght, his mind focused into a battle-set mode. The mace taken up in both hands, a swipe upward at the beast's jaw.

That'd be your second-round attack I assume :)

The elf's flight toward the door, with a passing attack with his mace, results in little more than an angry yell from the enormous beast and renewed shouts of "Pull the chain! Pull the chain! Don't let \`im escape!"

The dog, meanwhile, is rising up against the wall in a vain attempt to bite at the feet of the jeering throng.

Quarrel looks to the door, then the dog, while his weapon is at hand. It did come from some tunnels, meaning there could be more in there. Of course, it very well could chew his face off. But, it is distracted... With the renewed strenght running through him, he simply steps forward, swinging the mace like a woodsman's axe at the beast's hindquarter.

The Other-dog howls in pain as the crunch of bone temporarily overpowers the crowd of betting sailors and other miscreants, and a keening, unearthly scream issues from its throat. The savage beast, enraged, turns with evident discomfort and attacks.

... and misses, its hindquarters hindering its reach enough that jaws snap shut on empty air.

Quarrel has that look in his eyes. The same look as in the dog's. As it misses, he wheels the mace in an overhead chop downwards, intent on smacking it's skull. Impact or no, feet are set to bounce backwards, let the thing come after him.

The bloodied mace darts and weaves for a few more seconds in respect for the powerful beast's own tremendous power - the arm will probably need serious medical attention after this, assuming it doesn't land another attack - and as this unnatural creature lungeds forward the blunt instrument finds its mark. Brained, the dog makes a feeble final biting-lunge before crumpling to the floor.

The crowd explodes, the sound of money trading hands mixing with the mockery, laughter, and death threats so common among the class of people now assembled. "Haha!" bursts out one disreputable-looking fellow, throwing a handful of his own well-earned gold pieces into the cage at your feet.

Quarrel backs up, veins singing with the roar of nature, the elf tapping the cap of his bloody mace against the floor, watching the beast, and paticularly, those around. A glance behind him, wondering if he should flee, even if the firestorm in his body says to crack it's skull open. The noise, it nearly makes him run... and then he glances down at the coin. That singing in his veins drains, at the sight of the gold. Money, for **this**? And some would claim he is barbaric. Hooking the mace on his belt, grudgingly does he claim the coin, and reclaims his cloak, glancing down at the beast. A silent apology, before an exit is looked for.

The exit is available, and no man could move fast enough to close it if now was chosen as the time to leave. Nor does any man assembled seem to see a danger in such a deed. "Flee if you want," one yells, while another joins in "Run away and die before dawn!" "You'll never make it out alive!"

Quarrel claims his dagger, as well, and pulls on the cloak. Orcs in pale hide, these humans. He simply walks through the door, mace ready.

The tunnel is fairly long and straight, a lava tube of some kind? It plunges upward rather steeply after a bit of time. Here and there the bones of some creature, sometimes disturbingly human in shape and configuration, can be found. Not so much as a gold piece can be found, though some occasional shreds of clothing are seen here and there. The tunnel splits into three separate new tunnels at one point, one with a slight breeze coming through it.

Quarrel takes the path following the breeze. He's feeling a tad weaker, slower. Such happens, when the Fury flows through one's body, it's giving strenght is taking next. Such is the price of the inner strenght.

The third tunnel slopes up sharply, with a constant glow to it - sunlight or something akin to it? But as the tunnel opens out into a decidedly man-made chambler, it's clear that such is not the case. A continually-lit magic lantern sits on a primitive stone table carved from the very rock by unskilled hands, and this entire chamber - a room of perhaps 20 by 30 feet - seems improvised at best. An iron pipe is driven through the ceiling and into the room, about a foot in diameter, and from it issues a fresh breeze - ventilation, for the absent occupants of the room.

Quarrel pauses, and looks around the chamber. Paticularly, anything of immediate use.

A desk, with a good supply of paperwork, appears to have been brought here. A cistern is embedded in the rock of one corner, as well as what passes for a bed. Somebody lives and works here, but they aren't present right now.

Quarrel simply takes the lantern. Anyone who would stay here, must be in league wit those who had pinned him with the dog. Thus, they owe him so much. He takes up the lantern, and walks back down the tunnel, this time taking the middle one. Mace in hand, light in the other, he pushes on.

The middle tunnel leads upwards, and upwards, seemingly into the mountain ranges that hug the coastlands of the continent. It's very quickly evident that the tunnel system, such as it is, lacks much in complexity. Swarms of vermin infest the tunnels, but they flee quickly from the approach of light and footsteps.

Fatigue has long since passed, but as time wears on, the gnawing pangs of hunger begin to assert themselves. Returning to the first tunnel at long last yielded what might be a way out, though it took a great deal of time to locate - a circular iron grate set into the stone, locked with an enormous lock from the outside. The cage's bars are too thickly-placed to allow a mace to poke through, though obtaining the key might prove useful. Outside, the night air carries the smell of the sea into the cavern.

Quarrel sighs, and turns back, wanting out into the air, but the cage keeping him in looks a tad hard to break open with his simple weapon. There were other tunnels, he saw, and taking up the lantern, goes to investigate a hopeful exit.

".... fortunate that he did not kill the beast after all, your eminence." "Indeed. With a great deal of healing, it can be put back to use in your.... games." The sound of approaching voices echoes throughout the tunnels.

Quarrel stands up straight. Voices. About... hm? All right. The elf looks about for a more appropriate place to lurk, from the coming people.

Quarrel can tell from the echos they're not that close. Moving into an alchove like tunnel, he takes off his cloak, and wraps the lantern in it. The hide should block the light. Equally, he crouches in front of the lantern, against the wall the voices are approaching from.

A trio of figures passes through the tunnels, visible in fragments, but only two of the men speak. One is a highly tanned, harsh-voiced figure dressed in a light garment looking more like a prisoner's outfit than anything else, but walking with a mein of authority. Another is a sailor, one of the jeering men from the cage-fight before, who is himself followed by a younger and less assured man, who stays silent.
