# Iria 2002-08-15

The nature of this little band's mutual bond of association is unclear to strangers; each of these people, however, have their own strange connection ot the ancient ruins that dot the landscape of our modern world of Iria. Each in his or her own way relates to the lost history of the Millennial empire - to some, it's the explanation for their homeland's existence in the air, to others, it's the answer to certain troubling questions that even their patron Court will not shed light on. Whatever the cause, their skills are clear, and the Empire of Malvet sees fit to permit them the use of one of its airships. Commanded by the redoubtable Dwarven captain Dhuk and his halfling crew, they have sought out and found the source of the rumors of a new discovery...

A lad new to the city spread gossip far and wide of his discovery of a system of caves, obviously of very old Dwarven make, that sat well above the farmhouse of his family. With a reliable set of directions to go on, this small group of treasure-seekers and scholars has been set down on the lowlands by Dhuk, with promises to stay put and transmit any significant news or needs the party might make known to him. And with that, the little group finds itself looking up the climbing trail to the farm..

The lonely farm, growing stubbornly out of the stone roots of the gently-sloped Malv Mountains, consists of two buildings, a water reservoir cunningly carved out of the hillside, and a long strip of vegetables and other consumables watered by a gravity-driven irrigation system. A narrow road that winds its way under the furrowed, stormy brows of the imposing mountain peaks far above, and past it, water runs in a rough-cut channel to tend the fields. The farmhouse to the left, and a second building to the right, are enclosed in walls of black stone with an obsidian-like gate set into the center of the enclosure.

Akiko clutches her cloak about her, surveying the land ahead with her odd eyes. "I wonder what we'll find," she muses softly to herself. One of her hands strays from holding her cloak to rest at her hip, fingers drumming idly over one of her whips.

Ebber toddles along the climb, idly puffing, running fingers through his hair. "Well," Observes the human, clucking his tongue, before looking back in the direction the airship had dropped them off in. A tad out of his element, dumped in the mountainous homesteads, away from familiar clicks and whistles, the comforting surround of buildings or walls. Turning back, "Off we are, then."

Ryoshi stands apart from the others, slightly off to the side, while he too, looks around, not saying much of anything in response to the others. He seems glad to be off that 'metallic monstrosity' that brought us here, and he had muttered about it the entire way here, most likely comparing the terrible ride of the airship, and its terribe stench and noise, to the smooth, almost noiseless flight of the flying eagles his kind use as mounts. For now, he simply scans the surroundings, and gets some fresh air, now that he's away from the fumes of the machines.

Overhead, clouds are furtively gathering as though in secret conference with each other, though no rain comes from their deliberations. The little group makes its way up almost to the black gate of the walls; pausing only to note the disturbing stain of red streaking diagonally across the jet-black stone surface of the wall perhaps 20 feet to the left.

Akiko cannot help but notice the shade of red, pausing to look at it more closely. "I wonder.." she murmurs, breaking away from the path to touch the stone where the streak lies.

Under inquisitive fingers, flakes of something very much like dried blood break off from the stain and flutter about in the soft mountain breeze.

Ebber idly stares at the stain. He's reminded of the Millennials tested fast troop transport with catapults and nets across varied areas. Unfortunately, they had a habit of firing short, or long, or strong winds... A shake of his head. "Do we need to knock?" A glance to the gates.

The gate is untended, but closer inspection reveals a niche in the wall, in which hangs a bell.

Ryoshi follows, hanging back a distance as he lets the other two people go forward towards the gate before him. He obviously doesn't like being too close to one or more of his companions, and perhaps not even especially wanting to be here, but here he is anyway; an aloof partner, but a partner nonetheless. His behavior is a pretty common attitude for elves, towards surface dwellers, especially those in the empire.

The bell is rung; the sound of motion draws the ear to the right side of the compound, and a head and shoulders can be seen rising up from something - one of the buildings within, or on the roof of it, perhaps. The figure waves frantically, then disappears again. A minute later, the sound of footstes preced the unlatching of the gate from within, and it swings open ponderously.

Akiko steps back from the gate as it opens, the blood having set her on edge, so that her hand stays at her whip. She lets her cloak drift open, revealing the armor beneath. Her voice belies her wariness, sounding calm as she calls out, "Who is there?"

The opening of the gate reveals a figure at last. Within is a plump, middle-aged man of handsome features; a half-elf by the look of it. His hair and thin beard are gray, streaked with white, and his eyes are narrow and tense despite his smile. "Come in, come in," he announces immediately. "Ian Kinley, the patriarch of Red Lake Farm." His eyes immediately leap to the weapons each member carries. "Ah, good, you've come armed. Come in, we'll get you settled." He turns and hustles off into the enclosure, turning right and beckoning with one hand.

Ebber moves himself up to the opening of the gate, letting hands sink into pockets of the overslung coat, over the underlaying tunic and armors. A hand raises, again to tug at the stringy hair. As the fellow comes out, a bob of his head, before following, non-commentingly. "Onward, then." A glance over his shoulder toward the other two, before slipping on after Ian.

Akiko follows, though she's still a bit wary. "What happened here?" she asks the patriarch. "Was there battle?"

"Hmm, hmm, yes, in a sense," the man replies absently, opening the door to the smaller of the two buildings visible within the enclosure. "But of course you had to guess that from the job advertisement. I was hoping for more farmhands but you three will have to do." Since no word was sent ahead (nor could any have been), the farmer seems to be making a false assumption.

"What has caused the trouble?" asks Akiko. "You seem to have a pretty well-defended home, but I saw blood back there, as well." She shifts from studying the strange man to her surroundings, still wary of the situation.

Ryoshi comes in through the gate as well, eyeing Ian a little. He instantly recognizes the man as a half-elf, and while he isn't sure, some where he comes from consider half-elves an abomination. He hasn't much of an opinion about it, but he's still a little wary. When the farmer assumes that the group is some farmhands, he makes a derisive noise. "I'm afraid we're not here to tend to your crops, sir." he states, in an accented, melodic voice that could only belong to a full-blooded elf.

"Not good, not good," frowns Kinley. "Alright." He scowls, then begins stalking - in a much darker mood than he was only a moment ago - back toward the farmhouse. "You can still come with me and tell me why you're here then." The sky is already beginning to darken, despite the hour - only a few hours after noon - and the farmer casts a baleful glare into the sky.

"We were sent to investigate some caves near here," says Akiko. "But if you are having problems perhaps we might be able to help with that, as well?" she suggests. She looks over at Ryoshi for a moment, still unused to the Elf's arrogance, but her attention swiftly returns to the troubled farmer.

Ebber considers this. He glances to the sky, at the sudden change that seems to reflect the mood of their host. A peer back at the storage shed, a quiet consideration. "Some voles are about?" He ventures, in consideration, a look back at the elf at the thought. He has the look of a mage about him, which are known for their vole-attractions. "Also, any help with the water-systems can be offered, good farmer, hey? What's the fussing needing fixing?"

"Perhaps, perhaps," frowns Kinley, and steps inside the farmhouse. He welcomes each one into his home in turn by murmuring a short Elven invocation to the watchful winds. Once within, he seems to brighten a bit. "My wife, Jan, is downstairs beginning dinner. Feel free to join us when we eat, and before then I'll tell you what happened." On the first floor is a common living area, with padded benches and chairs. The farmer motions the group to sit before following suit, and he begins his tale...

Ryoshi nods quietly, noticing the sudden change in mood. He stays quiet now, and lets his companion do the talking. He doesn't react to Ebber's looks, and indeed, rarely even acknowledges that he exists. Much of the elf's arrogance seems directed towards the cleric, which is most likely understandable; with the tension between his race and Malvet, and Ebber personifying a large facet of the Empire's culture, it's expected that there be a large amount of tension between them, too. Towards Akiko, he's aloof, but not quite as cold as he is towards Ebber.

Akiko manages a small smile for Kinley, "That sounds wonderful," she says (in response to the offer of a warm meal.) She will sit and then listen intently, clearly interested in whatever stories the farmer chooses to tell.

Six months ago, Ian Kinley's son - the boy who spread the tales of ruins while in the city - left home, after exploring the upper regions of his father's farmland. He discovered a cave which led into quite obviously Dwarven tunnels, complete with writing in the old Dwarven tongue (which neither he nor his father could read). What Ian had not revealed to his son, but explains now, is that for many years there was a stone sealing the entrance to the cave in an attempt to block it off, and that stone had been laid there by a pair of Elven lords when Ian himself was young. It was not long after Ian's son went exploring that the farm-hands began to disappear; and it was only a few days ago that one of their replacements was found in what the farmer describes as an "unpleasant condition" outside the walls, after dark.

Ryoshi's ear catches the invocation in Elven, and he seems to relax a little, too. A familiar language, rather than the common everyone has been speaking, makes him feel a little more distant from the Empire. He, too, listens carefully.

"There's something not right in those tunnels," warns Ian. "Something that made two lordly Elves block it off and walk away. Whatever's in there is killing my farm."

Ebber settles down, and seems rather enthused to the offer of a meal. Even though the food may not be as best from some of the cookers Malvet-spawned, it's likely not utter rubbish; folks with hand in food know it. Relatively aware of the elf's general snoodiness, he knows humans akin to it, as well as simply it's the common opinon of elves. Not much surprise, there. He listens to the tale with creased brows. First, a little thankful he is knowledged in the Dwarven tongue, but as the tale goes on, he shakes his head. After a moment, the cleric proposes, "Undead?"

The farmer shrugs. "I'm not a scholar. I'm as brave a man as the next but I won't step foot in there to find out WHAT it is."

"Then we will have to stop it," says Akiko, though she's not looking too excited about the prospect. For her part, the food seems a feast, but then again, she's a vole, so her opinions are rarely valued. She still has her hood up, letting the shadows conceal her face as much as possible. "I am a scholar, and though I don't look forward to it, we are charged with finding out the story behind these caves," she explains, looking over at Ebber for a moment. "Are there often undead in such caves?" she asks.

Ryoshi's thin eyebrows are furrowed as well as he sits and listens. He tries to think of what he knows, to figure out what exactly it may be that it will fall to us to deal with. To be forewarned is to be prepared, after all.

Ebber spreads his hands. "The evidence pokes that it's happening at night, and things are down in the caves that wanted to be sealed up. Most predators and vile voles will hunt at night, sure, but ghosts or worse are known to haunt halls, and what else could be sealed away for decades, with no food, but come out kicking and ready? Elves are known for their love of nature," A glance hazarded toward Ryoshi, "Why seal something you love in a hole? Something undying, keep that buried."

Akiko nods, "That would seem the most likely way of things," she agrees. "We will have to find out, though, and it would seem the best time to set out would be in daylight, if we face the undead." She sighs and hmmss thoughtfully. "We will see," she murmurs, seemingly to herself.

Ryoshi nods at Ebber, probably the first time that he has ever directly responded to him in any way, during our time together. "It is more than likely undead. But it is best to be prepared for anything, when you go into unfamiliar territory," he says, quiet.

Jan Kinley, the farmer's human wife, makes an appearance upstairs, briefly. Apparently she's been privy to at least parts of the conversation (a not uncommon practice) and seems prepared as she ascends the stairs. "Dinner will be served, follow the steps down and wash your hands," she calls brightly. "Spend the night if you prefer, fortune hunters, we've plenty of empty beds." The means by which those bunks were cleared goes unstated, but hangs like a pall over an otherwise-excellent dinner.

Ebber reaches under tunic and underlaying armor, to pluck forth a necklace, and draw forth something hanging on it, much like a coat of arms, a miniature shield with heralded designs. "Always good to be prepared, but one weapon does make itself there, by the Courts' decree." A tilt to the woman's words. Ah, good. Food. Gloves are removed, and stuffed down into a pocket. "We eat, then, and good rests. Be you spells, ah..." He stammers for a title, at Ryoshi. "Good elf?"

For her part, Akiko will eat and enjoy the company, though she keeps her hood up. "Perhaps after we eat I can repay, at least in part, the hospitality with a bit of music and a tale of my own," she says to the farmer.

Ryoshi nods a little at Ebber, as he settles down to eat as well. "I am a battle mage. You can call me Ryoshi, in the future. It makes working together a little easier, I'd think," he answers Ebber.

Ebber nods, himself. "Indeed, does it. Ebber, then here. Let us prepare for the morning with minds wary of something, but prepared to deal with things unexpected. Not good to be armed to fight ants, and infact we have spiders."

After dinner is done, Akiko draws out her fine, silver flute and pushes back her hood, revealing herself to her hosts for the first time. "You can call me Akiko," she murmurs before putting her lips to the instrument and beginning to play. Only after many songs and a few popular fables does she bid her hosts good night and seek her rest.

Ryoshi seems to think Ebber's speech is very strange, but he nods to him. Once you get past the odd manner, he makes plenty of sense. Though he's starting to interact with Ebber, the tension between them is still palapable.

Night passes almost without incident; the sun fades, and darkness falls. At perhaps two hours after midnight, the air is rent by an inhuman screech, sounding far away for being so audible. Nothing further comes of it, however, and in the morning Ian and his wife are ready. Jan has prepared packed food for a day, and Ian will walk the group the half-mile uphill to the cave entrance, then leave them.

The yawning mouth of the cave shows definite signs of age and wear - what once was a perfectly square gateway into the darkness of the mountain's interior is now a battered ovoid at best. Earthquakes, stone settling and the ravages of time have all lent their hand in resculpting the work of Dwarves now long-passed.

The cave entrance looks a little foreboding - strange smells waft outward, and not all of the damaged runes surrounding the door appear to be Dwarven signs of welcome or warning.

The tunnel travels straight, into the darkness that lingers in spite of the party's everburning torches. Once a good twelve feet wide and eight high, many sections of the tunnel are so collapsed inward that one at a time must pass through the gap to proceed. As with many old ruins of this type, earthquakes and collapsing walls have taken a heavy toll on the structure.

Akiko takes the time to draw out her most handy of tools--the everburning lantern. The shutter is opened and light pours forth. "Well, I guess this is where we go in, hmm?" Her face is grim, but determined as she puts her foot down in the weathered cave and enters cautiously. (repose)

Ebber had brought along a pack, with shield, and all sorts of needed gegaws and such. Especially a vial, for that morning prayers for blessing the liquid were asked for, and then implimented to the water. Now, though, he toddles on to Akiko, passing onto her a metalic glass bottle, to place into the vole's hand. "A bit of celestial oils, and such. Give the undying a touch of burning." He tops it off with polite enough a smile, before taking from the pack needed equipment. A crossbow set in with a nooked arrow, shield, and such. A glance between the three. "I take it I'll be leading, then... You keep the lantern high and bright, yes?"

Those runes that survive - the Dwarven lettering at least, not the unknown scrawl in the rock - describe 'OUTER POST 421 - SECOND MOUNTAIN RING. VAL ASTRID, COMMANDING OFFICER'

Ryoshi stays mostly in the back, unslinging and taking the time to string his bow, with a bit of effort, holding it in one hand, as he follows. His sword stays at his side, ready, if he has no other line of defense. "I can certainly see farther than you can, even from back here, Ebber; I'll shout if I see something coming up."

The tunnel leads perhaps 50 feet into the mountain; the first break, visible to Elvish eyes before the light of the lantern illuminates it, is a four-way intersection.

Scratched into the stone at each of the four corners is a warning in three languages - Malv, Elven and Dwarven. Its meaning could be no clearer were it inscribed in a single tongue. GO NO FURTHER. DANGER, VOLES. - IMPERION. The tunnel stretches out to the east and west for 30 feet before terminating in a fork at each end; it continues north as well, into the darkness.

Ebber nods to the elf. "Right, then, but I speak the bearded tongue, so light is good for reading eyes." He dips a head to Akiko, then heads on forward, armor clinking beneath cloth and coat. He marches on down, at the steady slow pace, until haulting at the illuminated rules. "Well _Rust!_" The word spat like a curse. "Voles. Hrm hm. Beware with the magic, then!"

You have three tunnels to choose from; the tunnel entrance was to the south of where you are now, and you travelled north.

A sharp intake of breath as Akiko notices the first branch. "Take every right?" she suggests. She knew it could be a simple set of caves. Life is never that easy. "I wonder what kind of Voles are down here," she murmurs, adding on in a half-hearted attempt at humor, "Besides myself, of course."

Ryoshi raises a thin eyebrow when Akiko says that. He has known that Akiko was not human, but he has never bothered to ask exactly what she is. But, a vole? That is not expected. But she seems nice enough, so he doesn't make much of it, beyond the initial surprise.

Ebber spies the bardess with a little curious eye. Though, she seems harmless, and nice to peer at, to boot. No worries, no. A cluck of his tongue, eyeing down the east tunnel. "Well, that's a sure way to ensure we're not to get lost; end up in a circle for the left reverse. But, we've all chalk. Let's be to marking. East, we go?"

"Sounds as good as any way," says Akiko, taking the time to make a few marks on the wall. Perhaps more than are strictly necessary. She adds (in Celestial) a bold mark of '1'. "Here is our first turn, then," she murmurs, keeping the lantern raised.

Ryoshi simply follows behind, eyeing the marking that Akiko makes so that he can recognize it himself, before hurring along after his two companions.

Ebber heads down the east tunnel, after Akiko finishes with the marking. No sense in rushing her; those things can save lives. Then, once the light is set to work, off down the tunnel he goes, crossbow braced against hip, ready to encounter what will be, with wary eyes and attentive ears.

The eastern tunnel appears to open into what was once a room of some kind, now mostly buried under rock. Passages wide enough for a well-built human can be found on either side of the slab of stone, and beyond the rock is a gaping chasm, black as Mother Night, with a crude wooden suspension bridge swaying slightly. It's held in place by steel cables bolted to the rock.

"One moment," Ebber declares, upon seeing the cave in. He is careful in circling the stone. He makes for the scout, though, creeping around the edge, and peeking around with a palmed mirror. One swift circuit of the stone is made, before cost is approved clear.

Ryoshi, when he spots the suspension bridge, eyes it with some mistrust. The steel cables look solid enough, but the crude nature and construction of the wooden portion does not exactly inspire trust.

Everything is clear; no signs of creature, trap or obstruction (aside from the massive rock itself) are in evidence.

Akiko looks at the gaping chasm and sighs softly. "I'm not a big fan of unfathomable depths," she mutters. "How old is this tunnel?" she asks softly. She will test the bridge with first one foot, then another, since she's rather light, looking more than a bit worried at first, but, assuming the bridge doesn't collapse, she will gain some confidence.

The bridge may sway like an old nag, but it feels steady enough underfoot.

Ebber seems to be in league with Ryoshi, in that decision. First letting Akiko test, then prods it with his foot, at first, leaning upon the wooden slats, to ensure his weight can atleast be walked. A cluck of tongue. "Well, given the fact it's bolted in three places, and the center's tied more, then it should be a touch more safe..." Absently, the cleric wonders if that is a tagline best suited before disaster.

Ryoshi lets the others step across the bridge a few steps before he goes on too. He glances at each plank before he steps on it; it could cost him his life if he were to step on a rotten plank, and he's not about to let that happen due to carelessness.

"Shh!" hisses the bardess, tilting her head to listen. She whispers, "Listen! Can you hear that tapping?" For a long moment she just remains still, listening intently.

Ebber looks to Akiko, then sets to not move, listening intent.

Ryoshi suddently stops and tries to listen for it himself, his long, pointed ears quiver once, slightly...

The performer hears nothing more, but the priest's ears are drawn to a familiar-seeming rhythmic hammering sound, emanating from far below in the darkness.

Ebber's eyes alight. "Well," he chirps quietly, peering down into the unending darkness. "Seems there's a touch of life here, still; hammering. Miners, smithies?"

Akiko sighs softly, shaking her head. "I heard something," she whispers. "These caves are likely not empty, as the warnings indicate. Unfortunate, but hardly surprising." She will go further along on the bridge, leaning down to make a mark on one of the boards, indicating the path to the south, though she will check first, "Right again?"

Ebber looks back to Ryoshi, at the question; he was to ask the very same. "I'd toss my cap in, too. What says you, Ryoshi?"

Ryoshi squints into the darkness, though not leaning over. He shakes his head to himself after a moment, muttering to himself in elvish about something or other. He looks up when Ebber asks him. "It's as good a way as any, I say. We can always ome back and try the other."

Right leads across perhaps 30 feet of suspension bridge, perpendicular to the bridge on which the party set foot. A disturbing fact is made evident as the bend is rounded, however; the bridge seemingly stretched out further east at one time, but 10 feet east of the bend it has been shorn off. Not decayed or fallen; the pins that fastened steel cable to solid bedrock have themselves been ripped out, and smashed splinters abruptly replace solid wooden workmanship. Beyond is a small chamber...

This room, marked MAGICAL PARTS STORAGE, has been stripped bare. A heavy stone has been rolled over what appears to be a circular hole in the floor. Why would anyone want to dig a hole in the floor, much less block it off?

Akiko will wander over to the hole in the floor, laying herself out on the ground and first listening, then holding her lantern up where it might illuminate the depths. "Perhaps it's a well," she suggests quietly to the others, trying to avoid casting an echo down the hole.

Ryoshi frowns quietly as he looks at the circular hole, and asks the obvious question. "Well, do we move move it and see what's down there?"

The stone \`cover' could be moved easily, by the cooperation of the group.

Ebber circles the heavy rock stoppering the hole, and considers. Looking around the room, "Not likely. Or atleast, this is a Magical Storage room. No use for a well, here." Poking the rock with a foot, "I'd say this is likely a vertical shaft, with ladder. So, let's shove and snoop, then?"

Ebber adds, after a chuckle, "Unless that's a garbage hole, and there's some garbage eating slime in there..."

Akiko hmmss and murmurs, "This rock hasn't been moved in some time," she says softly. "Perhaps we should limit our search first to what has been shifted about recently, or do you want to explore this whole branch, first?" She considers the stone for a moment longer, "My thought is usually stick your hand only in the bee's nest when you must."

Ryoshi frowns a little at the thought of a garbage eating slime, or perhaps a gelatinous cube. Nasty, abominable creatures. He stands near the cover. "Well, that is a good thought; whatever it is that's bothering the farm has probably come from something that has been disturbed recently." He pauses. "On the other hand, we may find something interesting if we explore other areas..."

Ebber nods to Ryoshi, before turning back to Akiko. "It's better to work on one side at a time, then continually circling, prodding this, patching that, and so forth. Get one section done, then move on. I say we search every corner of one branch, then move on. That way, we don't leave things unturned, and don't need to watch our backs for something missed."

Akiko hmmss, "Very well, then," she says softly. "Let's move the stone, then, but if there's a sign of trouble, we'll move it back quickly." If whatever the trouble is doesn't move too quickly for that, anyway.

Ryoshi nods a little, and gets ready to move the stone, shrugging his cloak out of the way and kneeling over so he can start pushing.

With much heaving, grunting and panting of effort, the stone is pushed off to the side by a few inches...

Akiko will take the chance to examine the hole as best she can. First by listening once more, then by letting the light illuminate the hole.

Ryoshi squints down there, most likely able to see further than anyone, when we open it a crack.

Ebber sets crossbow and shield aside enough to get thingsn done, before he peeks around. "I could glow up a stone, to drop in?"

The rock appears to be wedged up against a channel of underground water; pushing it further would dislodge the block on the swift-flowing stream, sending it gushing down onto a cunningly-assembled little waterwheel. The effect would have been to ring a brass bell, probably very loudly. Fortunately that is not the case.

Looking past the intricate little alarm system, a roughly-hewn tunnel of rock - perhaps five feet in diameter, and clearly not Dwarven make - can be seen.

"Some sort of trap," mutters Akiko. "Do you see it, too?" she asks. "If we move it further, an alarm will go off, at the very least," she adds quietly. She looks to Ryoshi and Ebber, "What do you think, should we try to get past it, or try another way? It would seem something is being guarded here, but this construction was made from below, and there's another tunnel, as well, different from these."

The tunnel below seems to terminate here, but leads west into the darkness. Nothing more can be seen from the limited vantage available.

Ebber hmms. Moving around the rock to get a look down into the hole, and spying the awaiting waterwheel, a consideration. "Well... If I placed my shield in front of the waterwheel, then it should keep the water from spilling into it and ringing the bell."

Akiko looks at the situation carefully. "Perhaps the shield is a good idea. I'm not much help moving the rock," she says softly. "Maybe I should try it, then, or just jab it to hold it in place or break the wheel. Quietly." Of course.

Ryoshi nods. "If I get my sword in there, as well, we could open it up, and then completely disable it once we can get at it from a better angle."

"Sounds reasonable," The mechanist speaker offers. "Get down in there, and jab. Ready, then we'll be to move the rock and wedge."

Akiko just waits for the other two to decide their course of action, looking at the trap nervously. "If the alarm goes off, we probably should run out if possible. Better to fight on more favorable terrain." Such confidence.

Ebber considers a moment. "Wait wait, I think I could be best at this. I sometimes have to fish parts that fall into grates out with a hooked pole." He sits back. "Your sword, Ryoshi?"

Ryoshi nods quietly to Akiko. Sounds wise enough to him. He looks at Ebber for a moment, hesitating, before he shrugs, and offers Ebber his sword, hilt first.

Ebber takes it, and removes a bit of leather strap from a pocket. "One moment..." Tieing it about his wrist, then around the crossguard of the sword, he tightens. "Don't want to drop it, and it fall to the ground, then." Falling onto his belly, and scooting up, chainmail a-squeak under him, he grabs the rim of the hole with one hand to steady. Then, squinting with an eye, he lines up the shot... and jabs his body forward, point to wheel.

The sword is kept affixed in the mechanism of the water-wheel; it'll need to be held there while the rock is moved, however.

Akiko will wait for the go ahead from Ebber and then do her best to help move the rock, though she's far from a hulk, herself.

Ebber ah has! and gets the blade wedged in. Then starts to draw back, and makes quite the puckered face. "Uh oh."

Ryoshi looks at Ebber, tensing. "What's wrong?"

Ebber says, "I...tied my hand to the hilt."

"We'll get the rock away and then handle the wedges so you can draw away," suggests Akiko softly.

The stone scrapes noisily across the rock as an effort to lift and move instead turns into a hard push.

The sound of the rock passing roughly across the smooth stonework of the chamber is answered in a moment by an inhuman screech - identical to the one that awakened the group in the night, but infinitely and terrifyingly closer. Echoing out of the blackness of the grotto, it is repeated before the first has ceased to vibrate in the still air of the ruins.

Ebber lets loose an utterly agitated, if not a touch worried sputter. "_**Rust.**_"

And from the depths of the hole over which the stone was placed, an excited gibbering is heard faintly..

"That's probably what the bell was trying to alert," mutters Akiko. "No use for it now, is there? Stand here or try to make it to the entrance and the light of day?" She's already readied a whip.

Ryoshi grumbles alittle and nods. "Get me my sword, there's no use in trying to stop the bell now." ((How big is this room? ENough to fight well in?))

The chamber is perhaps 15 feet in every dimension - a cube, as was the style of the time.

Ebber wiggles, now. He wriggles around and plants feet against the stone, kicking back enough to unearth the sword from waterwheel. He unties it fast, before dropping it at the elf's feet. At the moment, he's scrambling after his crossbow and shield. "Atleast it's not garbage eating slime..."

"I have a feeling that we've unearthed something we should not have," says Akiko softly. "The screech is coming from the chasm.. so whatever that is, seems to agree." She looks from Ebber to Ryoshi, "Fly or stand? We don't have much time, and if we roll the stone back we're stuck in place."

Ryoshi glances out at the chasm area, to see if he can see anything.

Endless yawning blackness spreads out from the chasm, under the slightly swaying T-bridge.

Ebber is on his feet, shield and crossbow in hand. "I say we run, then." Pointing the crossbow at the hole, "Not many good ways up through that, unless they fly or climb fast. They'll be coming the other ways. Getting pinned in, I don't care for. The entrance, we go?"

Ryoshi nods a little. "Better to at least get into the caved in room. Let's get going, before whatever it is gets here."

Akiko will head towards the bridge, letting the lantern illuminate that open chamber, and try to get to more favorable ground.

Ebber is off. "I'll go frontward," He calls to Akiko, not wanting the light source to fall, at the very least. He steps onto the bridge, and sweeps his eyes to ensure nothing's coming across.

Ryoshi sweeps his eyes to make sure as well, ready to call out to ebber if he sees anything. He occasionally glances to see if something's coming from behind.

The party, led by Ebber, returns to the gently rocking bridge and rounds the corner. Careful listening, broken only by another shrill and nerve-wracking blast of mindless noise from the depths below, yields no sign of organized attack, no sign that the stone in the storage room is being disturbed from beneath, and generally no sign of assault.

The measured steps of the party are interrupted, as the bridge beneath and in front of Ebber's feet is smashed. Quick as anything, a ropy grayish tendril has risen up from the depths. Only the Elf's night vision, peripheral though it may be, would have given him enough time to shout a warning (were he inclined to do so....)

Ryoshi yells out, unable to tell -what- it is, but calling out, "Watch out, Ebber! Something underneath!" He can't shout much more before the tentacle smashes the bridge.

The tendril breaks through once-solid boards, as an accompanying shriek rends the air. The priest falls forward, unsupported now by the fragments of wood that are falling from beneath his feet into the endless gorge beneath, only a scant few feet from the safety of the caved-in room ahead...

.. And a flailing, helpless arm is seized by a confident grip and a hand which has fired a hundred strong arrows.

Alaina arrived at the farm after the rest of the group had left, having finished her independent mission and been picked up by Dukh and his crew. The blaze marks were easy enough to follow and she'd been hurrying forward to catch up after the first shriek, her own torch partly screened to avoid attracting attention. She'd seen the rest crossing the chasm and was just nocking an arrow to give covering fire when the creature in the depths attacked. She grunts as she takes the cleric's weight and swings him to the edge of the chasm. "Don't say I never did anything for you."

The tendril has vanished downwards into the blackness, but another sickeningly loud screech makes it plain that a return visit might be imminent.

Akiko will just draw out her crossbow and step back, looking to Ryoshi for a moment. "Jump!" she says simply, suiting her words moments later by attempting to leap the gap.

Ryoshi's bow is still in one hand, his sword having been sheathed. He waits for Akiko to get clear and then he tries the jump himself, as quickly as he can manage and keep his balance.

Ebber bangs his legs on the edge of the wall, just before the roof. Shield arm thankfully caught by his savior, he scrambles up onto the ledge, before letting his heart stop fluttering. "Thank Malvet!" His heart didn't explode, either. An appreciative look up at Alaina, "I would show my appreciation, but distractions afoot!" His crossbow ready, while shield arm outreached to catch those coming across who may need saving, themselves.

The gap is cleared, and none too soon - a few seconds after Ryoshi makes his leap, his space on the bridge is decimated by a second ropy tentacle, this one capped with a wickedly curvy black 'claw'.

Ryoshi turns back to catch a glimpse of that tentacle. He doesn't say anything at first, but then again, he doesn't need to. "I don't think we're going back that way any time soon." he finally states.

Akiko will try to get a bit further along the way, since dangling near one hell of a long drop is not her favorite thing in the world. "I think we'll have to try another route," she says flatly.

Ebber looks about. "To the entrance, then? Or dare delve we further on in, uncharted?"

Alaina says, "I would not want to be cut off by that thing."

Akiko will wander back towards the first forking, pausing to make a hasty 'x' under her first mark on the wall. "So, north?" she suggests. "If we leave now it won't make matters much better, will it? We still have to help that farmer." Which has somehow become her driving goal.

Alaina says, "Works for me. The creature under the bridge doesn't seem interested in moving."

The northern tunnel from the four-way intersection stretches, apparently, out to a hundred feet.

There are signs of a great boulder or stone having been placed here at one time; it would have blocked the left-side tunnel wall (when facing north), which appears to be a passage or doorway of some kind, but has been chiselled away.

Ryoshi looks towards Alaina, after a moment, with an unreadable expression. "If you don't mind me asking, what are you doing here? Not that I mind, since you kind of saved us, but this is the last place I'd expect help from passers by."

"Far be me to dive on in, but fortifying is what's likely being done. Best not let them have longer to prepare?" Ebber nods to Akiko. "Mark our stretch." Turning to Alaina, "Mind you taking the fore, lady...?"

"It apparently can move, since we heard it screaming last night," notes Akiko quietly. "Or maybe you sleep more soundly than I do?" A small smile at that, and it's far from pleasant. "Once more into the great dark," she murmurs, starting to make her way down the northern passage slowly.

Alaina snorts. "Hardly a passerby. Dukh picked me up from my last dig and dropped me off to join up with you. Alaina Vostok."

Ebber claims his own chalk, which happens in a pocket, to mark a brazen Elven 2, before starting north.

Twenty feet down the northern passageway, the remnants of a boulder lay scattered around an archway leading left/west, into a wide-open room. Another hole lays gaping in the center of the floor, this one having no sign of ever being covered. A rough-hewn tunnel is cut into the north wall and leads northwest out of the room - clearly a later addition, not of original Dwarven make.

Alaina nods to Ebber, nocking an arrow as she does. "This way, then."

UNLUCKY LOG EDITOR NOTE: reverse in final cut

Akiko will take a moment to invesigate this hole in the floor, a lot more warily than before. This hasn't been a day to be near deep holes in the ground.

The hole is a few feet in diameter and descends into a clearly-visible tunnel system beneath. Not Dwarven tunnels, however...

Ryoshi peers down in the hole. "Whatever's living here, it's like an infestation," he says, with a bit of disgust. "They're digging tunnels through the whole place, like ants."

Ebber peers at the room, the hole, before moving quickly to the newly additional tunnel, and peeking down it.

Ebber turns to Ryoshi, then, a little rueful grin. "So, we expected spiders, and got ants, eh?" He offers, wiggling his brows.

The tunnel at this level seems to curve off to the northwest, while the one on the level below runs evenly north-south.

"If the whole place is like this, I'm afraid we'll not learn much of use. The whole place seems torn-up and looted," says Akiko softly, her tone betraying disappointment. "I had hoped to learn something, but I am afraid the only lessons we'll be having involve battle. So, up or down?"

Ryoshi actually smirks a little at that quip of Ebber's. "I suppose so." He doesn't seem as cold as he was yesterday. But then, if you don't speak at all to the people you're risking your life with, you have less chance of survivng. He listens to Akiko for a moment..."Perhaps...though I hope we still may learn something...I'm hoping we do, at least...."

Alaina rubs absently at the scars on her cheek while aiming her torch down the hole. "Learning new ways to kill voles isn't something to be sneered at, either. Shall we?"

As the sound of "Shall we?" rolls from Alaina's lips, there's a soft chittering sound from beneath, coming out of the hole in the floor.'

Ebber wanders over to the hole, to peek in. "Well-" He pauses, at the sound of the chitters, one hand straying toward his holy symbol.

Alaina says, "That.... does not sound like undead."

Ryoshi immediately pulls an arrow out of his quiver, nocking it when he hears that chitter. He may not be the best archer, but he's at least a fair shot...

Akiko looks up at Alaina for a moment, staying silent in the face of that comment. She turns her gaze down and steps back from the hole, ready to toss her crossbow down to use her whip after the first shot, though she's holding back for now.

Ebber clucks his tongue, and crouches down. "Well... I'll hop, willing, if I can scare up some cover, while I see what's about?"

Those who travel the world and consider themselves well-versed in the lore of Voles have seen goblins, or goblinoids before. Imagine a goblin, now, with an enormous barrel chest, blank pads of skin where eyes should be but with a hideous eyestalk growing from its forehead, and its tongue hanging out of its mouth with a second eyeball embedded in the center of it, poised between sharp teeth. If you imagine it further with reversed legs, as a dog's hind legs are, that are half the size they ought to be in height and three times as muscled, you might have a picture of one goblin. But the other is as twisted and unnaturally changed as its partner, yet in none of the same ways. Its head is streamlined, narrow like a fish, with bulbous eyes that stare out unlidded and arms that break from two upper arms into a total of four forearms and four hands at the elbow..

The malformed creatures chitter at each other and ready their crude spears..

Alaina nocks an arrow. "Something is definitely not right with these things."

Ebber's eyes nearly buldge. "... Aren't you two just gruesome." He eases back a little bit, putting his shield, and eyes more on the many-armed one.

Alaina fires down the shaft at the strangely fish-headed creature. The arrow hits it, sinking into one of its multiple arms.

The four-armed creature emits a hiss of pain as the rude javelin falls from its grasp, and two of its hands leap to cradle the wounded arm. It spits a curse upwards.

Likewise, the tongue-eyed creature tosses its spear upward in a futile gesture - the weapon manages to reach the roof before clattering into the room, and the eye on the stalk grows wide with concern.

Akiko fires off her bolt, the shot striking her target in the leg. She then tosses the weapon aside to draw out her whip, instead, a mix of revulsion and pity in her eyes.

Ryoshi, with a bit of effort and creaking from his bow, pulls his arrow back, and t hen lets it fly, getting the strange creature nicely in the shoulder.

Ebber shifts his posture, not watching the fish-headed one, to roll his crossbow over, and fires towards the eye-stalked goblinoid. Although, the angle is all wrong, ending up sinking the arrow head into the stone at it's feet.

Alaina's second shot narrowly misses the creature, her arrow shattering against the stone floor.

This is too much excitement for either creature, and hastily they scramble away from the opening in the roof of their tunnel - travelling north along the tunnel beneath your feet.

Alaina swears as the creatures turn tail. "Last thing we need is for them to bring all their friends back." She drops into the hole, landing lightly on the lower level, and fires another arrow at fish-head, dropping him in his tracks. "That's more like it."

Ebber, while Alaina jumped down, had sat down, to crank his crossbow, and load it. Ready, set, and looking amid them, "Shall we follow?"

IDIOT GM NOTE: reorder crossbow loading during log edit.

Ryoshi, when Alaina jumps down there, decides to jump down there too and help out, firing a shot at the one that's left if he can still see it.

Ryoshi jumps down there and takes a shot, the remaining thing ducking out of the way as the arrow flies.

Akiko leaps down as well, charging up and swinging her whip, unfortunately she catches nothing but stone floor.

The creatures turn a corner and flee into the maze of tunnels beyond, yowling and chittering ahead at unknown and unnumbered companions...
