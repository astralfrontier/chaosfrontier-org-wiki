# Iria 2002-08-22

The party, allies in some ways, strangers in others, had just finished putting paid to a pair of mysteriously-twisted beings with some resemblance to the familiar goblin. And now that they've seen the inhabitants and current masters of the tunnel systems that twist through the mountain, they ponder their next move....

Ebber peers back and forth. "Well then... Er, hm." A pause, before looking back and forth. "Onward, then, to see what else lurks in?"

Akiko frowns at her failure to entangle the remaining.. thing. "After them?" she asks softly, turning to the downed creature and inspecting it quickly.

Ryoshi looks at the nasty creature that we had shot down as it tried to get away, wrinkling his nose in mild revulsion. He shakes his head, never having seen or heard of anything like this.

Akiko sees nothing of value; no heraldry or other insignias adorn this barbaric creature, and the only things of value it seems to bear are the tattered remnants of clothing it wears.

Ebber walks towards it, aswell, but pauses, at the sound of something. He taps his shoe, muttering, "Akiko." His shield-hand plucks the mace from his belt, while keeping crossbow armed.

Akiko hmmss, turning away from the corpse and looking the way the other ran, "After them?" she repeats, her voice just a bit sharper than the first time. She looks towards Ebber as she rises, blinking and waiting for someone to say something.

Ryoshi pauses for a second, and then looks up. "Wait a moment. I think I hear something...off in front of you."

Ebber draws back, while waving his mace toward the bard. "Back, a ranged stand we'll firm, first, if need be."

Akiko will do as directed, moving quickly to pick up her crossbow and then to load it. She'll listen, as well, to see if she can detect what it is that has the others on edge.

This time, the slight sounds of her companions' awareness also make themselves known to the bard. No more movement is to be discerned, by anyone in the group; nothing but the slightest hint of breathing, or perhaps cave-air wafting through these confining tunnels.

Alaina murmurs. "Well, this is going to get old quickly. Any ideas?"

Akiko shrugs, "Follow it into an obvious ambush, or try the opposite way?" she asks, sounding almost indifferent. She tilts her head to listen to the air move and hmms, "I guess we'll just have to see.."

Ebber considers. "I have an idea." He crouches down, setting mace aside, and picks up a small stone. Touching the cleric's holy symbol, a brief little incantation, before the stone is set a-glow. After standing back up, "Now, who cares to give it a throw to that intersection? See if any reaction comes frothwith."

Ryoshi simply stays back, leaning against the side of the cave as he watches, not saying anything right now, just listening for any signs of others coming.

Alaina takes the glowing stone and pitches it forward to land in the intersection.

The muffled sounds change in tone and nature; a few hints of gasping or quickly-stifled cries, perhaps? Perhaps just the wind. But whatever it is, it fades just as quickly.

Ebber clucks his tongue. "Either they're stupid, or smart. One way or the other, we're going to find out, hey?"

Akiko frowns thoughtfully. She smiles in a rather unpleasant way. "Anybody want to be bait?" she asks softly. "My guess is that diplomacy won't work that well."

Alaina says, "Maybe they're not fond of light. Or possibly magic? Let's go up and check."

Ebber gives a simple nod, and straightens up. "Well then, let's be off with it." He starts towards the way, even if a few glances are shot over his shoulder, to see if anyone's following.

Nobody appears to be following, leading, trailing, or otherwise occupying the tunnels but the party itself.

Alaina pads along with the cleric, keeping her eye on the junction, ready to shoot the moment she sees a target.

Akiko will follow closely, trying to protect, at least somewhat, Ebber's left flank. Her crossbow is held up and ready with one hand while the other keeps the lantern aloft.

Ryoshi follows, of course, bringing up the rear, and keepign an eye out behind us, to see if anything's trailing us.

The chamber beyond, only barely visible by the improvised light-source, is a large room whose visible wall is a single sheet of metal. The room seems bisected by bars, resembling a giant steel prison. The floor is littered with grime and detritus, marring the once-polished alloy the room is constructed of. Whatever sounds came down the tunnel, there is no visible source of disturbance in the room now. Following the westward tunnel into the room might reveal other exits.

Ebber puts his mace back, while taking up the glow-rock in his be-shielded arm. With that, the cleric creeps towards the bars. "Hmm..."

Alaina nods. "Hmm, indeed. Are they hiding down that way?"

Akiko looks around for a moment, following Ebber slowly. "I have a rather odd suspicion," she murmurs, moving the lantern about as she tries to inspect the room.

As Ebber approaches the room, he notes that the ceiling, rather than being level, seems to slant upwards, at perhaps a 30-degree angle from the far wall; the side of the room in which the entrance is set, the side he's approaching, must be at least twice as tall as the far side, which itself is a good 10 feet tall...

Ebber observes the ceiling, while commenting quietly, "I'm more concerned with what they were looking to keep in."

Akiko frowns as she looks around. "Perhaps we should proceed with more caution," she comments, staying near Ebber, just a pace or two behind and to his left, still there to guard his flank.

Alaina waits at the entrance to the room, ready to fire if anything attacks, trying to determine what the purpose of the slanted roof might be.

Fifteen feet into the room, the bars - constructions of the old outpost itself, not a new addition - run north-south from wall to wall, floor to ceiling. Beyond, laying on the polished metal floor, is illuminated the skeletal remains of what must have been a prisoner at one time. A bow and sword, pristine despite the ravages of time that have assaild their former owner, are visible, as are a few belt-pouches and bags of other things - gold, judging by the yellow gleam through the ratty holes in the pouches.

Alaina hisses. "Back, both of you. Something's on the ceiling."

Ebber makes a quiet prayer to the Court, a little gesture or two. A blink, at the proclimation, stepping back rather quickly, and nearly stumbling, while looking up.

Ryoshi stays back, not quite into the room himself, back in the tunnel and watching for an attack from behind.

Akiko doesn't waste time looking up, she simply rushes back towards Alaina. She'll turn when she draws close, raising her bow quickly.

Four figures, each distorted or twisted in their own way, have hung with impossible dexterity from hand-holds cunningly affixed to the ceiling of this prison-chamber, and now each releases its grip and falls - a twenty-foot drop, arrested by a thin rope each holds in its hands. One creature appears to have four legs; another, four arms, the extra set affixed mid-way down its torso. A third's head juts forth from its chest, rather than being rightfully above it, and the fourth looks utterly incongruous, a goblinoid with an eyepatch over one eye but with no further discernible deformity.

Ebber lets loose a little curse as the things drop around Akiko. Taking a quick, hasty step back, up comes the crossbow, aiming at one of those closest to the woman. He whistles, and lets fire. Bolt jumping, it speeds to the patch-eyed one, and skitters across it's hip, deflected after grazing. Glaring toward the creature, he stomps his foot, and makes a beconing gesture.

Alaina tracks the creatures as they drop and fires at the headless one as it reaches the floor of the chamber, the arrow plunging deep into its body.

Ryoshi calmly pulls a scroll out of his belt, and unfurls it, quickly reading several words out of the alien seeming runes. The arcane symbols glow and then burn out, and a fine dusting of purple sparkling motes of light sprinkles over the area, and some of the goblinoids...simply drop, accompanied with a sound resembling the sawing of logs. **snore**

The only creature who doesn't immediately slump over is the furthest-north goblinoid, the one with four legs. It gets a panicked look on its twisted face...

The creature rises up on its legs, drops its crude javelin to the floor, and extends its arms in a plain gesture of surrender.

Ebber nods his head. "Good, good." He starts to walk toward the surrendered insectish goblin. Clearing his throat, offering out in dwarvish, _"What?"_

The foul creature makes no further move, but begins yammering in some strange tongue. It doesn't seem to be profane; more along the lines of information.

At one point, the creature points toward the skeleton behind the bars. It seems to want to make a trade, and what it wants for itself can easily be guessed.

Ryoshi discards the now useless parchment, after the purple glowing runes completely burn out and disappear, as he sits back and watches the others deal with the primitive creature and its vulgar (to his ears, anyway) language.

Akiko snorts at the fallen goblins. "I suppose we'll have to bind them all?" she murmurs, turning back to what had caught her eye earlier. She'll head closer to the bars and inspect them carefully. "I think I can reach that skeleton over there," she says.

Ebber looks back at the group, before looking toward the skeleton. Frowning a moment, he taps his foot. He points to the goblinoid, then to the bars. He spreads his hands, then points to the skeleton, then to himself, with a questioning look.

The creature seems confused, but points to itself, then to one section of the wall, then raises a leg experimentally. It takes a step toward the spot on the wall indicated, looking from face to face to weapon to weapon, judging reaction. Another gesture, to the bars, then both hands lift into the air, mimicking the bars lifting - it seems to be willing to open the enclosure, though how it intends to do so remains unclear.

Alaina says, "Aye. Why is it back there, dead, if anyone could get to it? Looks like he's trying to trade his life for something he can't get to anyway. But if he can open it..."

Akiko sets her crossbow down to pull out her whip, instead. "Yeah, who knows, but I'd keep your bows aimed at that thing," she murmurs before she lashes out with her whip through the bars...

Akiko's whip snaps around one end of the sword's hilt, and steadily she's able to draw it across the ground. However, as the metal of it touches the bars, there's a loud **ZOT** and lightning arcs from the bars to the sword itself... the tip of the whip is singed, but no other damage is done.

"I'd warrent that was their bait, to get us in here." Ebber nods his head, making a 'shoo' motion with his hands, at the goblin. His mouth opens... and closes.

Behind her, the creature chitters in evident amusement. Again, it beckons at itself, then at the blank spot on the wall toward which it wants to approach.

Alaina says, "Well, now we know why no one's gotten in there." She nods to the creature, gesturing toward the wall spot with her nocked arrow.

Ryoshi stays in the back, though where the mutated goblin can see him. Since he appeared quite scared when the magic affected his friends, he takes it upon himself to ensure there's no problem; his hands stray near his scroll belt, seemingly ready to grasp at one at the first sign of trouble.

Akiko frowns, "Hmm, well, I guess we let that ugly thing give it a go." She taps her foot as she glares at the goblin, pausing to pick up her bow, the business end of it pointed right at the goblin. "If you can't get that, you won't have much to be pleased about," she says calmly.

Ebber says, "Binding those other ones with a bit of leather would be a good idea, I think." A glance behind him, "Don't want them getting awake and causing a rucus."

The creature scurries - four feet scuttling with practiced ease - to the wall, and a dirty hand stretches out, palm flat on ordinary metal. A section of the surface, a square surrounding the hand, glows with a brilliant white light, and in a heartbeat the metal bars have **swoosh**ed downwards, each pole dropping into a socket in the ground - nothing remains of the 'cage' but the metal frame bisecting the room. The creature's hand withdraws, the light fades immediately, and again it holds stock-still, mindful of the weapons pointed at it.

Ryoshi says, "They're not going to wake up until they have a good nap, at least. Unless you kick them, or step on them or some such."

Akiko hmmss, "I wonder how these slime learned to use these things?" she murmurs. "Stay back, I'll go get the things. If anything happens to me, at least he'll not escape." And she'll just head on over to the skeleton, then, half-expecting to be captured in the process.

Ebber watches this with a bit of curiousity. Hm. A glance to the sleeping goblins, then back to the quad-legged one. A little chuckle rises from him. "Well, I think I just figured what we're to do with his fellows..."

Alaina says, "Trial and error, I'd suspect. Wander around the room touching things and you'll hit it sooner or later."

Ryoshi gets someone to help him quickly start tying the other goblins up, though, anyway, working quickly.

Nothing untoward happens, and Akiko approaches the skeleton - an Elven frame, obviously - and is able to retrieve what little has survived. Perhaps 400 gold pieces, of a mint over a century old, a composite longbow of mighty pull, and an excellent-looking longsword with an Elven inscription on it. 'Family of Imperion, Warrior-Mage of Ark'.

Ebber does move to help the elf, at the very least get the goblins anchored in, before they wake.

Ryoshi suddenly catches a glint of inscription with his sharp eyes, after he's done binding. "Is that elven on that blade?"

Ryoshi quickly steps over to take a look for himself.

Akiko frowns thoughtfully at the remains of the Elf. "Hardly a fit resting place," she murmurs. "At least they haven't troubled these old bones." She notes the inscription, shaking her head as she returns, "I wonder if this family would like their property returned. I wish we could take the bones out of here.. but somehow moving them seems wrong, as well."

Alaina doesn't take her bow - or her eyes off of the goblinoid, though she gestures with the arrow again, away from the panel. "Ryoshi? He's one of your people. Your decision."

"I say we bury them," Ebber chimes in. But, taking a bit of cord, he approaches the yet-free goblin. Holding those bindings up, he makes a beckoning motion.

++Editor: them/him.

Ryoshi frowns a little..."I wish we could at least give him proper rites, but...there's little we can do. Normally, our dead are cremated, while a priest says the rites."

Akiko will take an extra sack out, "Very well, we'll take the bones away from here, then." And she herself will gather them up, putting them carefully into the sack, trying to handle them as little as possible in the process. The remnants of the elf's garments are likewise put in the sack.

Alaina says, "What worries me ... didn't you say that this place was supposed to have been sealed up by Elven lords a century ago? About the time he died? I wonder why they didn't try to get him out first..."

Akiko says, "Perhaps they did not know the way to lower the bars," says Akiko. She adds, "Though there are other possibilities. They may have sealed this place in a hurry, knowing they would be leaving their own trapped inside."

Ryoshi nods quietly to Akiko. "Thank you. It is probably for the best. Although we cannot get an elven priest to give the rites, we can at least get a priest of some order to consecrate them, to protect against necromancy." He takes a look at the two weapons, and asks, "May I see them for a moment, Akiko?"

Ebber makes with the tieing of the goblin. "All right, to keep these ones from getting away," He adds, and starts urging the four-legged one toward the cage section, "Let's store them in here, until we're ready to go home?"

Ryoshi helps Akiko pack away the bones as well.

The goblinoid goes sullenly but unresistingly. The others can be set into the cage as well, and anyone who tries to re-seal the door will find it easy to do - the bars spring back into place at a touch.

Akiko hands them over to Ryoshi, "They are better in your hands than mine," she says softly. "I'd not wish to.." She trails off into silence, simply waiting for Ryoshi to claim the weapons.

Ebber takes the time to observe the mechanisms, peering curiously. "Hm." A glance about, searching for the origion of the lightning.

Ryoshi bends down and takes them. "Imperion...when I get back to Ark, I will be sure to return these to their rightful owners. For now, I'm sure they will not mind if I use them in the cause of finding out about our homeland, though, so I will carry them."

The bars are apparently charged with electricity of their own, a defensive component of the \`prison' that still operates in spite of the destruction wrought to the complex.

Akiko looks around briefly, "Anyway.. let's keep going, shall we?" She waits for someone to lead the way, as always, and will just stay at that person's side, guarding as best she can while holding up the light.

Ryoshi tests out the longbow, finding the pull a bit of a strain, but he can manage it, and it's most definitely more powerful than his own. He's shocked that the string is still intact, even after all these years. These are both incredibly well-made.

Ebber takes the time to load his crossbow, and hold the glowstone, before pausing outside of the tunnel. "North, then?"

The tunnel north leads a way past the side-tunnel to the prison-room, then splits into east and west passages.

Alaina says, "Might as well."

Akiko nods, "Good as any other way," she murmurs. "We probably have a lot more of those things still to deal with." She pauses at the forking, "West?" she suggests, pausing to make a mark indicating the way the others choose.

Ryoshi nods quietly, finding this discovery sad, but all the same, it fills him with hope for more...he hopes to find other things of interest to his race in this cave.

The westward passage terminates after fifty or sixty feet, though there is another aperture in the ceiling...

Ebber says, "West is every much that east is. West, then, and let it not be the end of our sun?"

Akiko mutters, "Hmm, somehow I feel our answers do not lie above, but below." She looks to the others, "Up or back and take the other branching?"

Alaina says, "Deeper in, perhaps. We're going into the side of a mountain, so deeper in need not be down."

Ebber says, "What lies east, then, seeing as this goes up?"

Akiko hmmss thoughtfully. "Well, perhaps we should find out?" She will turn back and head to the other branching, then, holding up her lantern to light the way.

Alaina shrugs. "I don't know. Shall we go find out? Let's be careful not to run into the creature under the bridge, though."

Ebber offers a ruefull chuckle. "Judging by the size, I don't much think we'll be accidently stumbling into it..."

Back along the eastward track, the tunnel extends almost an equal distance to this one - fifty or sixty feet, though east instead of west. This time, it curves southeast, opening into what's obviously a larger area - judging by the flickering light visible near the end of the tunnel.

Alaina says, "No? What if we open the wrong door?"

Ryoshi quips, "I haven't seen a door in this place yet."

Akiko hmmss thoughtfully, "This is taking us back in the direction of the bridges," she murmurs. "Perhaps we'll find out just what it is, if we keep going this way. It might be interesting, but such knowledge might cost us an arm."

The sounds of movement come from beyond, in the dimly-lit cavern at the end of the tunnel; the party falls silent at the sign.

Akiko doesn't say anything, just thrusts the lantern into Ebber's hands. She makes a sign for the others to stay back while she goes off to get herself kill.. err, to scout ahead! This might be the first time the silence of her movement is really noticeable.

Ryoshi definitely notices that. He can't even hear her movements, even with his sensitive elven ears. He's actually slightly impressed.

Beyond, the roughly triangular chamber has only one other exit - a tunnel leading further east. Boxes, barrels, without exception all old and rotted, fill almost the entire room - this is a storage area, clearly. Three goblinoids are just disappearing into the eastward tunnel, while two remain behind - one, the wounded that ran from the party initially, and another, a priest by obvious inference - the glow around its hands as it treats the warrior's wounds is unmistakeable.

Ebber makes the motion to cover the lantern, and stares ahead, keeping ready, if need be...

Akiko will be smart and head back to the others, having learned what she needed. For now. Only when she's sure the others are drawn far enough back to be whispered to without being overhead does she speak. "Three of them left, two have stayed, one is a priest, apparently, and the other is our friend from earlier, getting healed. I can try to sneak in and get behind them while you attack head-on."

Ebber considers, a moment. No, not enough to waste a large spell on. He glances toward the elf, a moment. "Have another one of those scrolls primed?"

Ryoshi nods. "I do, but it's my last one."

The sound of water flowing makes itself heard in the tunnel. Not a gush, like a river, but more of a trickle. The party's collective memory flashes back to the water-channel beneath the magic-parts storage room.. whatever underground water-streams exist, something about them has just changed.

Ryoshi says, "I can cast a Flaming Sphere in there, but that will definitely ruin any chance of surprise."

Akiko shakes her head, "We should probably be a bit more careful, I don't know what might be in those barrels and boxes. And.. it might provide us the answers we need."

Ebber says, "Perhaps, if we surround them, that we can get them to surrender, aswell?"

Akiko shrugs at Ebber. "So, what do you want to do. I can probably get back on top of them again, but now all of them will be ready for.. something, at least."

While the party deliberates, the sound of stone being moved can be heard in the distance. Its direction is unclear, but certainly it has to be coming from the tunnels to the west and/or south.

Ryoshi raises an eyebrow at that sound..."What is that?" he asks no one in particular.

Alaina says, "I think we should retreat for now. I don't think we want to get trapped down here."

Akiko hmmss, "That might be a good idea." She will take her lantern back, then, keeping the light mostly covered.

Ebber listens, for a moment. "Excivation?" A pause. "So you suggest we leave, for now, or go at a different point?"

Ryoshi says, "Maybe we should just go investigate what that was for now..."

Alaina nods to the elf. "Exactly. Let's find out what's going on, just in case it's dangerous."

The sound of scuttling feet can be heard, moving through the tunnels.

Akiko hmmss, "They are probably just preparing for us.. the more we dawdle, the more time they have.." She will just follow the others, though, wondering what they have in mind, precisely.

The party returns along the passage, then travels south at the T-junction - a quick glance into the prison-chamber reveals the bars intact, and four glowering goblinoids in hushed discussion with each other. Further along, an unpleasant discovery is made - the hole through which the party descended has been blocked off with stone.

Ebber stares up at the rock. "Ah ha!"

Alaina says, "Lovely. Continue south, then?"

Ebber says, "Gentlemen, ladies, I believe we may have our answer."

Akiko frowns, "We're just walking from trap to trap," she mutters. "Should've just attacked them when we had the advantage.."

Alaina says, "What, and charge blindly into a nest of the critters?"

Ebber makes an off gesture. "My guess is, this is the stone that was in the waterhole we approached, before. They removed it, rolled it around, and plugged this one up. That could explain the water; that water channel is unplugged, and thus allowing it to flow around."

A further sound of scuttling feet makes itself known, this time echoing down the northern tunnel.

Akiko shrugs, "There were just two, and it seems we're really caught, now." She hmmss as the sound of movement is clear. "Not long, now," she whispers.

Ryoshi nods at Ebber. "That makes plenty of sense, I'd think. Let's go explore south for now. In a pinch, I might be able to push that rock off anyway," he says, patting one of his scrolls.

Alaina says, "Let's keep going. There's probably other places to get through."

Akiko will follow to the south, too, keeping her ears pricked to catch any more noises.

Ebber gives a little sigh. "Either we stand, or we scurry. But if we head south, there's a possibility of getting pinned in, hey? A pincer, if you will, from that way."

The party turns south, then, travelling several dozen feet through the crude tunnels until a westward bend is found - and thirty feet beyond it, an excavation upwards, but unfinished. Looted tools for digging lay scattered around.

Ryoshi says, "That's a risk near any way we go."

IDIOT GM NOTE - reverse order of last lines in log.

Ebber says, "Touche."

Akiko hmmss, "So, we're stuck." Not like there's a lot of choice, at this point.

Alaina says, "If you think you can break through, give it a shot. We'll hold them off."

Ebber picks up one of the tools, and walks about, prodding at the ceiling, and hmming. He paces back, once or twice, then taps the tool on the wall. "Well then, if we truelly get trapped in, a blast of sound should get this dislodged. Although I was saving that for an emergency, but in case we are pinned in, well... that's an emergency."

The sounds of feet in the tunnel grow louder and closer..

Ryoshi nods. "I think this would be best used as an emergency exit...a sound burst right now might bring them houwling down upon is."

Ryoshi tries to see if he can see what/how many are approaching.

Akiko shakes her head, "I think this is an emergency already," she observes, noting the sound.

"All right," Ebber announces. "All of you, get yourselves back. No sense in being crushed in a cave in, on the way out."

Ryoshi says, "There's about a dozen of them coming up! This may be an emergency! ((Can I take a shot at one?))"

Akiko will just wait for the trouble to show up, or the way out to be opened..

Akiko will take a few steps away from the closed end of the tunnel, then, since there's actually some room. And then she'll wait for the trouble.

Alaina moves away from the incomplete excavation, setting herself and her bow about twenty feet from the corner. "Let's hope they're not expecting us to finish the hole."

Ebber moves in, and touches his holy symbol. A few slow words to the Court, of normal decree and recitation of the law. He poitns the tool at the ceiling, where the dig is unfinished, and utters, "Boom." The air is filled with the shrill shrieking of gears grinding, of parts wailing, and various other horrible noises, centered there.

A shudder ripples through the already-mauled rock in the ceiling overhead. The goblinoids, never the best miners to start with, lack precision in their workmanship, and parts of the tunnel give way. A smaller boulder impacts the Elven battle-mage on the shoulder, sending him reeling for a few seconds; a larger manages to graze the Otherworldly diplomat, leaving a stain of reddish-copper trickling out of her uniquely-colored hair. However, the mess of stone at the top of the excavation gives way. Behind the party, the silent throng yammers and hollers, seeming ready to charge forward. Improvised stone steps provide a quick way to the room above, if the party takes it...

Akiko won't wait, she's going. What could be worse then a bunch of goblinoids, right? Hopefully the next few moments won't offer up a solution to that question..

Alaina shakes her head at the noise, then glances back for a second. "Did it work?"

Ebber says, "Come on!" The cleric charges up the spilled stones and dirt, moving as nimbly as the chain-mail decked fellow can. "They're at our heels!"

Ryoshi runs up there as well, still a bit unsteady, but looking more stunned than actually hurt. When he gets up he quickly nocks an arrow.

Alaina shuffles slowly backward, continuing to watch the corner. "I'll take the rearguard. Let's go."

Akiko will turn to see if the goblins are following, "Where to now? Running around blindly won't do much good!" she says. She turns to look around the new chamber, "We must be near the exit again.."

Ryoshi says, "We could make a stand here. They'll be slowed down by the fallen rocks and they'll be lined up in the passage nicely!"

The chamber the party emerges into is made - mostly - of the same metal that walled the prison-chamber below. Large breaks in it are what made the party's entrance possible at all, and a large collection of dust covers most of everything. It is a testament ot the seals on the room that not a single spiderweb can be found on anything. There is a diagonal wall making up the northeast corner, and inset into it is a door, made of the same metal and quite obviously sealed close. And there's something else here....

A figure, a life-sized replica of a Dwarf, hewn entirely of stone, stands motionless in the center of the room. As the party scrambles up through the hole, its eyes open and it speaks in a low, stentorian voice, the old Dwarven tongue coming from rigid lips. "I am to defend this place. I must resist intruders."

Ebber's eyes grow about the size of saucers. He halts, at the top of the blasted way, and turns around. "Back in the hole!"

Akiko says, "What is it saying?" she asks, not making a move to run away. This thing obviously _belongs_ here, it's the first encouraging thing yet. "Can anyone understand it?"

The careful jingling of motion comes from the excavated hole. It's clear that the goblinoids are moving but they are certainly not interested in moving fast, at all.

"It's a Guardian," The cleric says hastily. "It's going to resist intruders, to Defend."

Akiko hmmss, "Ask it what intruders it needs to defend against. We come here in peace. We seek knowledge, we don't come to steal." At least she doesn't intend to.

Ryoshi points at the door on the other side! "I don't think it's going to care. But if we can get to there and out, it will leave us alone, right? Let's go!"

Alaina says, "Doesn't work that way. It's an automaton - if it doesn't recognize us as legitimate, we can't argue with it."

Ebber turns on his heel, and points down the hole. In Dwarven, "_Creatures, invading! Everywhere._" he points again, before starting toward the door. "Let's be quick about it, then!"

The figure of stone does not move. "Access to the door will not be granted to any but authorized personnel," it grates. And indeed, Ebber and Ryoshi can find no purchase, knob or other visible control. The chittering from the hole in the corner grows louder and more confident.

The thing speaks again, in Millennial this time. "To repeat - I am to defend this place. I must resist intruders." It begins to stride now, slowly and purposefully, toward the hole that was made in the floor.

Akiko now ignores Ebber and the others entirely, switching to Millenial, "We are visitors here. What intruders do you protect this place from?" she asks.

Ebber lets loose a deep breath. "Well, that's certainly a little... more helpful."

Alaina moves away from the hole, circling around behind the dwarf-golem. "Let's hope it doesn't care for goblins."

The stone figure turns, regarding the Vole before it with absolutely no emotion - its rocky features motionless expect to speak. "Access to the door of this chamber is limited Zoan Clearance Eight. All such individuals are authorized."

Ryoshi gets behind it too, making sure it's striding -away- from him.

Akiko will stay squarely in front of the automaton. "Zoan Clearance Eight?" she murmurs. "How do we demonstrate our clearance?" she asks, sticking to Millenial.

The rocky exterior regards the question with somethin akin to contempt. "Access to the door of this chamber is limited Zoan Clearance Eight," it repeats. "All such individuals are authorized."

Ryoshi frowns a little and looks towards the hole..."Try to tell it that we want to help defend the chamber against the goblins coming up the hole."

Akiko ponders for a moment, "Do you have anything else at all to say? There are goblins who are going to attack this chamber, does that interest you? And since only those with that clearance may enter this room, doesn't that mean we must have it?" Dwarves weren't known for conversation, she shouldn't have expected their automatons to be different.

Alaina rolls her eyes and continues to concentrate on the hole in the floor.

Ebber doesn't think that chatting with a golem is going to help, but, he's confident in his little corner. It seems intent more on the goblins.

The golem-thing gives no further indication of emotion. "I must resist intruders. Entrance is possible by other means than the door, but that does not imply clearance. You will not leave except by the door or this hole."

Ryoshi frowns a little bit, and heads over so he can see down the hole...

Akiko frowns at the automaton, "Then what does imply clearance?" This thing is dumb as a.. well, technically, it _is_ a brick, isn't it? She's still speaking Millenial to it, useless though it may seem.

"Access to the door of this chamber implies authorization," replies the stone Dwarf; the testiness in its voice must be your imagination. "Those who enter or leave by the door are authorized."

Akiko looks around and sighs, saying to the others, "This is crazy, it keeps saying the same things to me. I'll keep trying, though.." She shifts back to the automaton, "What are you guarding, then? Do you mean we can't leave now except by the door?"

Ebber clears his throat. "But, we are part of the Zoan Eight?" He points. "The intruders have blocked the door."

"I guard components for the primary and secondary weapons systems, tools for the rail system, and the diagrams of the launch delivery system," recites the golem coldly. "Demonstrate clearance by opening the door."

Akiko hmmss, "Try to feel around a bit on the wall. Remember the bars? Maybe there is a way to open the door like that?" She peers at the dwarf automaton, staying silent as she considers what else to say to it.

Ryoshi heads over for the door quickly, suddenly thinking of something. He heads to that door, and pulls out one of his scrolls, reading it as he simply knocks on the door. ((It's small enough to affect, right?))

The door remains stubbornly shut. One of the goblins has stuck a stick up through the hole, and the golem reaches down promptly, grabs it, and snaps the end off. The stick is quickly retracted.

Ebber's eyes bulge. Why didn't he just **think** of this sooner. Turning around, he touches his holy symbol, and chants another writ to the Court, invoking those powers of the Mechanistry, to jumpstart artifacts of mechanical old.

The door hisses open, and a slight tingle runs through everybody in the room. The golem, still poised by the hole, turns and regards Akiko impassively. "Authorization is recognized. I will continue to defend this place."

Alaina nods and speaks to the golem for the first time. "Carry on."

Ebber looks a touch sheepish, but grins none the less. "Bless the Court." He turns, turning his thumb toward the way out. "Shall we?"

Akiko hmmss, "Make certain that no goblins may enter this place," she adds to the golem, then switching back to the party, "Well, where to now? Looks like the goblins aren't coming through here."

Alaina says, "Let's check a few of these crates. This may be quite a find, if it's an intact spares storeroom."

Ebber says, "And, he mentioned primary and secondary weapons system." Dropping his pack, the cleric extracts his crowbar. "To it, then!"

A few more of the goblins decide to toss javelins up at the golem; they bounce off effortlessly. The party digs into the boxes, crates, barrels and other stores that litter the room, blowing away dust before cracking open one after another.

Akiko will just consider the automaton, asking curiously, "How long have you stood guard here?" Since everyone else is looting, she might as well waste a little time conversing with it, since she has clearance now.

One box contains a large number of metal tubes, perhaps a foot long apiece, and half a foot wide. The attached piece of transparent material (rather like smooth, see-through leather) lists them as 'Airship: Anti-Dragon Shells'. Another contains the specifications for some elaborate mechanism, sort of a super-catapult, meant to launch spheres of some sort into the air for long distances.

"One thousand one hundred eighty two years two months eleven days sixteen hours since the last order was given," replies the golem, now swatting away arrows.

Ebber starts looking into the boxes... and giggling with glee. "Oh, oh my! This is just... Delightful!"

Akiko tilts her head, keeping far enough away from the automaton to keep safe. "Do I have authorization to give you an order? What is your name or do you use an idenfication number?"

"You do not. My classification is Earth Defense Automata. I have no name."

Ryoshi stays quiet, just staring at the golem swatting away arrows as if they were nothing. He glances at Ebber for a moment, turning his attention back to the golem. He grumbles about his wasted scroll.

Ebber moves to open up another box, just spilling over with excitement.

Alaina looks awestruck. "This is a major find. If we can get it all out safely..." She chuckles at the disgruntled Elf. "I'm sure this will cover replacing your scrolls."

Another box seems to have a good supply of alchemical mixtures - mostly evaporated, but a few vials are still stoppered and sealed. Each is clearly labeled in Dwarven. The usable vials include three 'cure light wounds' potions and one 'cure moderate', in modern parlance.

Akiko hmmss thoughtfully. "Can you tell me more about what else is kept here?" she asks of the automaton. "What happened to those who created you?"

Ebber looks amid the boxes. "Oh, mm. Just beautiful, this is! I wonder..." He wanders back, to inspect one of the anti-dragon rounds, to see if it could be taken apart... safely.

Meanwhile, the golem has calmly reached out for a javelin that lies on the ground by its feat. With a flick of its stone wrist, it hurls it at and through the open doorway. A goblinoid falls forward, into the room, the javelin sticking out of its forehead. "I can provide a complete manifest on request. I do not know what happened."

Ryoshi steps over to Ebber and looks in some of the boxes. "What exactly -are- these things?"

Ryoshi is still keeping an eye on the Golem. He seems rather glad that we're not fighting it.

Ebber is rubbing gloved hands together. "Weaponry for the Empire. Over there, rounds to take down Big things. That? A highly functional siege-catapult. And I found some healing potions, too. Good; less I need to deal with. Save my materials for other things."

Akiko smiles at the golem, "That would be quite helpful," she says. "Is there a library here?" she asks. Being somewhat the bookworm and all. It's going to take some effort to pull her away from the golem until she's satisfied that she's learned as much as possible from it.

Alaina swears as the golem turns to throw a javelin through the door. "We've delayed too long. Now they're at both doors."

Ryoshi narrows his eyes at the words, "Weaponry for the Empire", but he shakes his head. He suddenly blinks and turns towards the door.

Ryoshi heads towards the hole again and quickly tries to guess how many goblins are still down there.

"Information retrieval section is one level below this one," states the golem coldly. "This is a vang-class facility, information retrieval is at Stroke 9." The word it uses, 'vang', refers to a character of the Dwarven writing system, which is illustrated through successive strokes of a pen or brush, each character having a specific order in which it is formed.

Ebber says, "For the love of metal, Tell that thing to go kill all the goblins, so we can get to sorting all this out."

Alaina says, "We're not authorized to change its program, Ebber. And even if we could, sending it one way would leave us to deal with the goblins from the other direction."

Akiko hmmss, nodding to Ebber. "I think Alaina is right, though. I lack authority to order the automaton to do anything. Perhaps if I convinced it they are intruders that need to be destroyed? I'm almost afraid to see what might happen, though.."

Ebber sits up. "Are there any other guardians waiting to be in function, in this compound?"

"There are four guardians of my type," responds the stone creature. "One guarding the primary weapons system, one guarding information retrieval, one guarding the entrance, and one guarding the storage room." By inference, the entrance-guardian has been destroyed, and the last it refers to is obviously itself.

Ebber nods. "RIght then. And, how do we get to the primary weapons system?"

"The primary weapons system is on this level - Stroke 13." For those fluent in Dwarven, you'd go as far east as you could - which is the deep, dark grotto with the deeper darker creature.

Ebber smacks a box. "Rust. We'd have to go across the rope bridge to get to it."

Alaina says, "I think it might be easier to drill a new tunnel into the mountain. That thing down there worries me."

Akiko shakes her head, "We'd have to fly, more like. The guardian.. thing.. probably destroyed all the bridges, now. And the east bridge was already destroyed." She rises and taps her lip, "Well, looks like we have to cut our way out, one way or the other. I hate to abandon this place, though, I think there is a lot a more below."

Ryoshi says, "If we can somehow take care of all the goblins, we'll probably be able to explore in relative peace..."

Ebber considers. "Are there any weaponry in this storage room which could be used by personel, instead of on mounted equipment?"

"No. Tertiary weapons are kept in the armory. Stroke 2, this level." Remember the room with the hole, where the first goblinoids were seen through the hole? That would have been it. "However, chemical weapons are available." Too bad they're the broken flasks that were found with the potions.

Ebber looks at the other boxes. "Where are other potions?" He asks the golem, while removing the healing elixiers from the box before him, and placing them in a bag.

The golem will indicate the shattered vials. "Earthquake damage has rendered some of the inventory unavailable."

Ebber walks towards the golem. "What is north of the entrance to this level?"

Akiko hmmss, "I have an idea," she says. "I think I can at least buy us some time for a hasty escape from here. Maybe.. hmm.. 15 seconds or so of free time to move." Since she's going to be wasting some of that time covering half the attack routes.

"From the primary intersection, points east: Magical parts storage. Primary weapons system. Points north: tertiary weapons storage. Rail system. Rail parts storage. Launch delivery system. Access to second level. Points west: storage. Points south: entrance."

Ebber nods his head, to that. "And, where do the rail systems lead?"

"The rail system delivers munitions from the storage area to the primary launch systems, and provides access to the north-face airship hangar."

Ebber turns back to Akiko, and draws towards her. "Well," He begins, "If you do plan on going about like that, I've a spell for you. It should make your trip a touch faster."

Akiko hmms, "We'll all have to move quickly. I can't keep the halls greased for very long," she explains softly. "Assuming they don't find some dirty trick to get around it.. I'm also hoping they aren't too capable out of their caves."

Ebber says, "Right, but you need to get there, and get back rather fast. A speeded scout is a scout that can retreat quicker."

Akiko will do her little plan. Rush out, grease both halls, and then it's a quick run out the front door!

A few javelins and arrows are lobbed, from goblins waiting in hiding, but nothing connects hard enough to put anyone down for good.

With all due haste the party makes tracks, heading out the front entrance and into the refreshing glare of midafternoon sun. The ruins merit further investigation, but a better-armed group can return prepared, and for now, strategy and rest is called for...
