# oneshotparttwo

Crouched behind an overhang of volcanic rock, the Elven stranger listens to the conversation of three men passing by through the tunnels. The three fade, heading apparently from the grated outside entrance toward the "office".

Quarrel, guessing that if they had came from the grate, that it's still locked, he takes up his cloak wrapped lantern in one bracing hand, and mace in the other. Then, simply walks after them... at a definet distance.

".... My light is gone. That intruder you so carelessly let free has probably stolen it. Well done," the irritable voice of the tanned man in the half-bare outfit can be heard thundering down the tunnel. The other man's response is more restrained. "Your eminence, we thought... we thought perhaps that you had another..." "I have no more beasts, and I refuse to bring forth another just to solve your difficulties. Find this man and dispose of him, immediately." "Yessir."

Quarrel finds it fortunate that he did not choose to stop and speak to these men for his freedom. Instead, the elf takes another little side venture, to ease into.

A sidelong passage is easily attained, and the footfalls of two men approaching are quite clearly heard - the pair of sailors, without \`your eminence' in tow judging by their conversation. "... Stuffy, stuck up --" An unknown voice, the junior man obviously, begins and is cut off. "Quiet, you. He'd have your head cut off and magic it onto the body of a brown bear before you finished five more words, if he heard. Let's just get that uppity little snot. C'mon, you go that way."

Passing within a few feet of your hiding place, but unaware of anything amiss as he spends the time muttering foully to himself and cursing the strange man in the office, the junior sailor makes only the vaguest attempt at a real \`hunt' for you.

Quarrel, from his hiding place, sees the man walk by. Instead of letting him just go on, or deciding to splatter his mind across the elf's mace, instead, he intends on taking him peacefully. As peacefull as hitting him in the back of the knee can be. Cocking the weapon up, he swings.

Unfortunately, most combats don't take place in a relatively low-ceilinged lava tunnel, and this calculation is omitted in the swing. The sound of the mace skittering and scraping across hard stone can be heard, and a little sprinkle of dust falling on one's head only serves to add insult to injury. Or lack of injury, in this case.

Bill says, "PHB p.25 if you want :)"

Quarrel curses his luck in elven, not wanting to have to get into a standup fight with him. However, seeing as he has little choice, the elf leaps forward, rolling the mace into a shoulder-lined swing.

The surprised sailor wheels around just in time to expose his shoulderblades to a relatively light tap of the powerful mace, but one which still sends him reeling. "Cap'n! I found 'im!" he screams into the tunnels, without much hope of succor - it's one thing to hear a shout in this maze, but quite another to find your way to the source. He looks quite dazed, but manages to draw his shortsword and weave unsteadily into a few quick swings of his own.

Nick, cut and slash are given, though haphazardly, to each arm wielding the powerful mace. The sailor, elated by his success, spits a curse and raises his weapon again, ready to take your life if given half a second of chance...

Quarrel hisses at the slices, and instead goes for a sharp rap, a more serious swing, intended for the sailor's stomach.

The sailor's shortsword skills, while far from lacking, are kept fully on the defensive as he brings his weapon to bear against each successive strike of the mace. No opening can be made, but no counter-thrust is possible either without sacrificing his own defense. "Curse ye," he growls.

Quarrel dodges the blade, and in the defense, looks to thrust the mace-head into the man's chest for a short, driving strike. It doesn't work. But, he does bring the haft up to smack his returning thrust aside. In that, the elf drops into a crouch, and swings at the sailor's knee.

The kneecap cracks audibly; the sailor's fleeing turns into a falling, and without a chance of avoiding it he strikes his head hard against part of the black wall of the tunnel. In the hushed glow of the continual lantern, blood flows freely.

Quarrel's heart leaps into his throat. He hadn't intended to kill the man, more to get him on the ground to bargain his exit. Hurridly, he skitters towards the lantern and cloak. The dagger fetched up to slice a good swath from the hide, before he moves back to the man, tieing the swath in the most makeshift of bandages over his fractured skull.

The sailor remains unconscious, but such an individual must have a key or something similar to allow him into the tunnels. Or is he at the mercy of his superior, the Captain, who even now must be running to find the intruder his subordinate called out?

Quarrel ties the bandage, and hopes this man doesn't end up dead. Atleast, his intent wasn't to kill him; no need to fall for an accident. With that, the elf moves to searching the man, to find a key, anything to help him.

A ring of keys is found, but only one looks large enough to match the hefty lock securing the grate outside. Now, to find the way out before the Captain arrives - or will that worthy already be waiting, assuming his junior lost the struggle?

Quarrel hooks his mace into his belt, and takes up cloak an lantern. Key in hand, the elf simply begins to sprint down the hallway, toward the grate.

Not too much later, the exit to the tunnel system is easily located. The key does indeed fit into the lock, and with a shrieking whine of protest the iron bars open outwards into the pre-dawn air.

The grate opens out onto a narrow ledge, apparently the terminus of a well-traveled, if dangerous, mountain path. Twinkling in the distance at the foot of the mountain are the lights of Seabreeze, and beyond the lambent flame of the watchfires of the ships in harbor as they slumber. The tunnel is perhaps halfway up this hill, and it shouldn't be too difficult to trot down the mountain to reach the village again. No other egress from the steep hillslope seems practical.

Quarrel shifts his cloak, to throw it over his shoulders. The lantern is left on the tunnel's lip. This, he quite viciously kicks over the edge of the tunnel, down the drop. There. You have your lantern back; now go get it. Moving out onto the ledge, he shuts, and locks the gate, before throwing the keys over too. Turning, the warrior then starts down the path, once more.

The path down the mountain slope is made more pleasant by a cool breeze from the water, but not by the memories of imprisonment and death in the tunnels that gnaw like a cancer through the hills overlooking such a seemingly harmless town. The borders are reached after several minutes - the guard at the gated wall, so used to seeing people sneak down from the mountain in the morning, admits you without a word or glance of confirmation.

Quarrel patpats. "It's only as good as I'm putting into it, Bill; I didn't give a background, since I didn't know exactly what was goin' on."

Quarrel shoulders up his cloak, and goes in search of the temple, walking through the streets. His arms still sting, the majority of his wounds scoured there, and much of his blood is caking them. There is supposed to be a temple in the city his uncle is from, so he is told. Good humans - this he shares a bitter chuckle to - that should help out.

At the center of town, in its usual place, is the Day temple - even now its continual light shines like a beacon against the darkness. And as always, its doors are open. Within is a little man hunched over a fire burning at the center of the main chamber - itself a cylinder of hewn stone bricks, with arched doorways leading into the other chambers of the simple establishment. "Hmm, hmm.."

Quarrel walks in, now, despite his relative continence, is slightly a-stagger. The wounds, the exertion, the work with little rest, it is a hammer into his body's temperments. "E...excuse me..." He handles the common tongue with none too intellectual a tone.

The diminuitive figure looks up from the burning flame before him and clucks lightly. "Hmm, hmm. Bleeding. Healing?" A man of few words, this one.

Quarrel offers in elven, a much more usable tone, "Rest, and healing, if it's affordable, divine one," The last words used in respect.

The soft language washes completely past the little man, as evidenced by the confused look on his face. Nevertheless he steps forward to get a second look, then beckons you into one of the side-chamblers, yet another cylindrical room with a single bed set against one wall. "Sit," he commands, then bustles out of the room.

Quarrel drops his pack, his cloak - torn in one area and caked in blood - as well as weapons beside the bed, and sits heavily down onto it. The armor, a gift from a fallen father, is sitting heavy and tugging. Looking at the dirty, bloody arms and form, the elf finds that he feels more dirty then even wallowing in mud; no, this grime has come off the very city, the people, and stained him.

The little man scuttles back into the room bearing a bottle of Landoline, an above-average Elven wine with an old name and good history. A pair of wooden mugs - the staple of ale-drinking in this town - are held between his fingers, and carefully he pours out two cups. "Drink," he instructs, and in doing so takes a light sip from one cup.

Quarrel takes the other, and lifts it to his lips, drawing a taste... before he hesitates, and watches the man. True, priests supposedly could be trusted, but after his ordeal, he decides to test the little man. Instead of taking the offered cup, he reaches forward to take up the one his benefactor actually sipped from.

The cup is surrendered for exchange without comment, and again the little man takes a sip. At last he speaks more extensively than he has. "You've been in a fight." It's a simple statement, not a question. "Not your first fight. But you look disturbed, shocked. Surprise attack? Voles? Bandits?"

Quarrel draws on the liquid a little more healthily, feeling confident in the man's trustworthyness. He's drank such liquid before, disarmingly soft in taste, but the power comes later. "...Canine." He glances down to the puncture wound on his forearm. "And blade." He taps the mug, "Drinking in a... house of drink. I awake in a pit, with canine."

Quarrel looks slightly frustrated, with his lack of verbosity in the human tongue. It makes him look...idiotic.

The man's eyes widen a bit. "Stop drinking," the priest suggests, equally laconic but seemingly from natural inclination rather than a lack of command of the language. Meanwhile, as the wine seems to have been well received, he sets his own cup down and rubs his hands together. After a moment, a shining aura encompasses both hands, and reaching out, a feeling of dreamy distraction overtakes you. A reeling, a feeling of watching a waking dream or being part of a vision, but it only lasts a moment. As the world comes back into its normal focus and the feel of disorientation passes, it's quite obvious that the worst cuts and lacerations have already closed, and more well on their way to doing so.

Quarrel, at first, thought that perhaps something ill had happened, despite his inherit like for the little man. He had sat his drink aside, and watched the glowing, albeit knowing what it likely is; he's been healed by divine ones before. But, becoming concious once more, a glance at the knitting flesh, an appreciative smile. "Thank you."

"Duty," replies the little man thoughtfully. "Tell me about the fight?" he adds after a moment. Whatever happened has cast a pall of trouble over his features, and he hunches forward curiously to hear an explanation.

Quarrel eases to rest his back against the wall. "In the pit. Men above, gold exchanged. I fought the canine. Bigger then human. I won. I ran into a tunnel. Met a man with a sword; we fought. I might have killed him. Took his keys, got away."

"Tunnels here?" the priest asks quietly, almost knowingly.

Quarrel says, "In mountain."

The little man bows his head and takes another quick gulp of wine. "Troubling," he announces. "I have heard stories, but you are the first to survive and tell. A paladin will be sent." Those chosen of the Day temple to burn the wicked with holy fire, a Paladin is the soldier of good. No other Court sponsors such champions, and against these experienced warriors, a small band of sailors is unlikely to win. "Need other help?"

Quarrel holds up a hand, with two fingers. "Rest. And, Zaquil A'quilizer, uncle."

Nodding, the little priest waves a hand at the bed as an answer to the first need. "I'll see about locating him." And with that, he stands up and departs. Little conversation, but seemingly little need for it.

By midday, Zaquil has been located and escorted to the temple by the paladin of the temple, one Marcus Rourke, who is then dispatched into the mountains to find and deal with the threat. Now he sits heavily on the stone bench in the cylindrical main chamber of the Day temple, sighing and smiling. "Been so long..."

Precisely.

Bill is a dope.

Quarrel is cleaned up, well rested, and weaponless. Instead, in simply the traveling ensomble he had been embarked with. "Uncle," The elf offers in native tongue, "I've come. We need your records, for father is dead. Valliantly, and his tale for the poets and storytellers, but we need not only his history, but for the family's."

The man bows his head in assent, replying in kind. "I left long ago," he sighs. "Never to be wanted, until now. And my brother is dead. This is the curse that befalls me for my rash action. I shall return with you, and your - our - family will know its heritage again. Your fathers and forefathers, and their stories, are known to the elves even when our people still lived on the ground," he proclaims a little proudly, referring to the now-floating Ark of weightless rock sailing hundreds of miles to the north through the skies. A millennium ago, indeed.

Quarrel nods his head. "Let us get ready to travel back. It will be a long walk, but we can make it, uncle." A shake of his head. "I do not see how it is you stayed here, but to each his own, yes?"

"I stayed in the aid of a friend of mine, a scholar of antiquities who has been performing excavations in these mountains," your uncle replies softly. "His work will continue without me. I will leave the travel arrangements to you, and I will be pleased to pay our way - I've profited somewhat from the digs."

Quarrel purses his lips. "Well, then, perhaps a pair of steeds would do well, then... But, it is good I found you in time, uncle, and wasn't dispatched by savagry."

"True. We can find horses here, and I'll arrange the purchases... tell me, young lad, what brought you to the temple in the first place?"

Quarrel gives a shake of his head. "I was wounded," He replies honestly, looking out one of the windows toward the mountain. "And they call our way of lives barbaric."

"They are, in a way," uncle answers softly. "To live in the mountains.. to see not another soul for days or weeks.. I could live there no longer. But that is only my choice, not yours.. I wil not judge you or the rest of my family for it." Rising to his feet, he lays a hand on your shoulder. "Come. Let's get back quickly."

Quarrel nods his head, simply. "Welcome back, Uncle."

Bill ;would hand out XP, but well.
