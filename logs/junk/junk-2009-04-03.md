# Junkyard Heroes 2009-04-03

May 9, 1995. The Oklahoma City bombing happened only a few weeks ago; it's still in the news. What got less attention was a fiery dart that seemed to fly straight down from the sky, embedding itself violently (but not explosively) not far from I-280, just outside of New York City. The projectile was large, and hot, and glowing. It landed squarely on the property of Tobacek Lazureiwicz, known less clumsily to the Americans in his area as Toby Lazarus.

Toby is a junkyard dealer by trade. He drives a burly tow truck and hauls cars to his yard. for scrap, expertly dissecting them for useful parts and salvaging the rest however he can. He takes old appliances from the neighborhood, extracting any remaining usefulness and discarding whatever he can't use. Such a man would be almost karmically suited to the task at hand: making some sense of the wreckage of an alien ship which now burned and gleamed red in his yard.

Toby lagged only a few minutes behind another interested party in tracking the craft's descent: NORAD. Of course, it actually landed before an executive decision to shoot it down could be reached. A rather more bemused second decision was made: send some people.

Toby found a survivor in the wreckage. It was a humanoid, with feminine features, sculpted out of a sort of shimmering living metal and crystalline amalgam, and it smiled and called him by name when he approached. He named her Aura, and the two were already in conversation when the military arrived.

Now Toby has put out a call to everyone he knows. The military found out the hard way that their weapons aren't effective against either the junk dealer nor his extraterrestrial visitor; now they've settled for a form of conflict resolution that works against someone who isn't immune to bullets: negotiation.

---

The higher-ups have called in their most dependable man. Someone not given to excitability; someone level-headed; someone capable. Now that impulsiveness has failed to pay off, a radical rethinking of the situation is working its way through the chain of command who are aware of just what happened.

The man they've chosen is equal parts historian and investigator. Secrets that could have once toppled governments moulder in dusty archives; this is their curator. He waves away the body armor that is offered, leaves his sidearm with the soldiers. He approaches the angel and the scrap dealer with a mix of awe and exhaustion. "Angels fall from heaven," he muses, "and the government sends me. Your tax dollars at work." He holds up a hand in greeting. "Special Agent Francis O'Shea. Call me Floyd. I'm here to make a deal."

_I needed new parts for ol' Silver anyway,_ muses Jason Lane as he steers the beat-up '89 Buick into the gate of the junkyard. He wasn't sure what to expect when old Toby called him, but he certainly wasn't expecting the military. "Whoa," he says aloud, suddenly nervous, and suddenly a lot more careful about his speed; Silver tends to backfire when he stomps the gas, and he doesn't want a noise like that going on around here.

Marcus Golden rarely goes anywhere these days without careful planning and scheduling, but when the call comes out from a good friend he's quick to clear his calendar and make an appearance. He steps confidently out of his vehicle and appraises the situation quickly. Some nervous looking feds fiddling about who leave a clear path into the Junkyard. Having made his way dozens of times before, Marcus simply crosses the street and heads right through the entrance.

After a quick trip to his own car, to grab his sword, Colin wanders onto the scene. He looks over, waving to Toby as he runs over, seeing the men on the scene. "Hey boss, what happened!" He jogs over, slowing down a bit as he sees the fuzz. He looks at Floyd with a bit of trepidation, but until they look over and start pointing, he'll continue to approach.

Floyd rises slowly. "Mister Lazarus, I'm hoping this is a friend of yours." He eyes the sword, knowing that only two kinds of people carry such a thing in this day and age. Neither of them is good news in this situation.

Toby sighs. "Ellis is coming soon, my comrades," he says, shaking hands with his friends as they arrive in turn. He refers to Captain Ellis Tove of the US Air Force, another friend of his. "I want you each to meet someone. You too, er, Mr. Pink Floyd. Come this way."

Colin waves at Floyd with a beaming smile. Hey, he hasn't demanded he be disarmed yet. "Howdy! You like Mokoto?" He says, gesturing hilt in Floyd's direction. Anyone who knows, and looks, can see that it is indeed peace knotted. But still carried. He nods to Toby. "Sure thing, boss." As he follows.

He leads the way to where the 'angel' is sitting. She's wrapped in a grease-stained white sheet he uses when painting cars, and smiles as the group draws close. "Hello," she says, in a musical voice.

Jason runs a hand through his hair. "Like, what's this about?" he asks, following in Toby's wake. "It must be like, some serious..." And then he turns the corner, and his jaw drops open. "Holy shit."

Colin gives Jason a friendly whap across the shoulder as he swares. "Manners, man. Jesus." He bows, in a very Japanese way, from his midsection, head lowering to just below the waist, before coming back up. "Nice to meet you."

"Toby, sorry I couldn't get here faster, I was on the other side of town," explains Marcus. He nods to the others, "Jason, Colin, how are you doing?" The small talk is cut rather short by the revelation of the vrey strange 'angel'. One black eyebrow arches for a moment, and then Marcus simply rolls with it, "Uh, hello there, miss."

The angel smiles again. "Hello," she repeats, just as beautifully. Toby beams proudly. "I call her Aura," he explains. "Comrades, listen. These government people, I don't know what they want to do to her. But she is a newcomer, huh? She just arrived. Let us make her feel at home." He turns. "Aura, my friends. Mr. Marcus, and Colin and Jason. And this is Mr. Pink Floyd, he is from the government."

"And he's here to help us," says Jason, always ready with the wisecrack.

Floyd had been praying in Latin under his breath; Jason's remark brings him up short. "Yes. Yes, I am. Otherwise, those men over there," he gestures in the direction of the assembled soldiers, "are going to have to figure this thing out for themselves. None of us want that."

"A pleasure to meet you, Aura. Welcome to America," says Marcus warmly. He's still calculating just what kind of situation he's in in the back of his head. "Wait a minute.." He quickly puts two and two together. "Just how far has our guest travelled to get here?"

Aura looks up at Marcus. "I don't know," she says, matter-of-factly. "I was captured in my unformed state and sent here unaware. But I don't know where my home is. So I cannot tell you how far."

"Heaven's a long way away, I'd imagine." Colin nods to Marcus. Then he beams a smile to Aura. "No matter how far you had to go, but you seem to be welcome here."

"Miss Aura," Floyd begins softly, "On behalf of our leaders, I apologize for your rude reception. The United States Government is prepared to offer you asylum."

Aura looks confused. "You think I'm crazy?" she asks.

Floyd looks confused himself for a moment. "Um. No. It's a legal term, it means that wherever you came from, the authorities here will give you protection under our laws, equal to any other person." He withdraws an envelope from the pocket of his trenchcoat and holds it up.

"Peace on our world is always uneasy," he continues. "It used to be common for pilots to come here from the opposition, land in a foreign aircraft, and request asylum. That's the easiest way for our leaders to understand this situation." Floyd looks meaningfully at the others. "Otherwise we have a mess."

"Oh." Aura turns this over for a few moments. "Then I'll accept your asylum, if that will make things easier on you," she concludes brightly.

Colin smirks, "Are you sure we don't have a mess anyway?" He nods at the various soldiers around the area.

"Wait a moment," says Marcus. "I think there are some other details in that little offer, right?"

"Dude, shut up. This is serious," Jason says to Colin, still stinging from the gentle rebuke he'd gotten from Floyd.

Floyd smiles. "Not for long!" He makes a hand signal in the direction of the assembled troops. Within seconds, weapons are lowered and guns stowed. Further back, police cruisers turn off their warning lights. The sigh of relief is almost palpable.

"There," he remarks. "Far less serious."

Toby claps his hands together. "Fantastic. Now, Mr. Floyd, er, don't you have some paperwork to go file or something? May I speak to my friends alone here?"

Floyd says, "Almost, Mister Lazarus." Floyd withdraws a second envelope, and looks at Marcus. "Aura has asylum, no matter what happens. I'm also authorized to negotiate an agreement for access to her... um... vehicle. Our top men will want a look, but I won't let them take without giving." He hands the envelope over and retreats to the line of soldiers. He can be heard a moment later, shouting, "Someone get me a coffee!"

Toby grins widely. "Comrades, that man didn't even think to ask how our dear Aura learned English. But I will tell you. She is linked with me - she learned what I know, and I am slowly learning some of what she does too. So here is the bargain." He gestures out the door. "Parts of the vehicle which she wrecked herself here on are scattered over the planet. Things called links are falling to the world. They will cause great hardship and calamity, so I have to help her make this right."

"She can give links to you, and you will be able to help me. What do you say, comrades?"

Colin looks at Toby. "You're sounding like I do sometimes. But.. what do these links... do?" He hesitates, "I mean, if I have the capacity to help the world, I'll do it, but..." He smirks, "This sounds like something out of a comic book."

Before Marcus focuses on this new offer, he's going to peruse what Uncle Sam has put on the table. "Seems fairly straight-forward. Suspiciously so. Selling the government a ream of paper involves more legalese than this." The second part of the offer seems to give him more to chew on, and then he is drawn back to the conversation. "Links?" he murmurs.

"Links are..." Toby pauses, looking at Aura. The lovely alien smiles and smoothly steps in for him. "A link is a sort of machine. On one end is your thoughts, your mind, your brain. On the other is .." It is now her turn to pause, and a rapid stream of musical tones emanates from her voice. "I don't have words for it yet. But think of it as an invisible machine which touches some part of your planet. Your skies, your oceans, your devices, the things around you. Elements."

Jason looks enthusiastic. "Elements, eh? About time that chem major was good for something."

"Can you show us?" suggests Marcus. "After all, our hands touch all those things. I have a feeling you mean more than that."

Toby nods. He claps his hands together, rubbing the palms, then reaches out gingerly. His fingertips make contact with a steel sheet. Carefully he lifts it - but not with his hand. It moves along with his hand, floating and flowing in impossible ways, reshaping itself. He smiles as he works; the shape becomes more and more apparent. A steel rose is its final form, and he presents this to Aura, who graciously accepts the gift.

"Now that's something you don't see every day," breathes Marcus. Being rather impulsive he says, "At my age, it's rare to have the opportunity to see the world in a new way. I'm interested."

Colin smiles. "Usually the magician will run the trick hoop around the subject, but yeah, I'm totally in."

"Okay, that's pretty sweet," says Jason, clearly impressed.

Toby grins. "So. Aura, will you link them?" The alien nods, and reaches out a hand, touching each man in turn. Around their right wrist a glowing halo of white light springs into existence, shot through with darker particles which move and dance. It quickly fades, but the presence of it remains.

Colin closes his eyes, and feels the cool, if fragrant breeze of the junkyard wash over him. Even in his days in his dojo, he has not bee this aware of the space around him.. The way the air moves between and around him, the cool touch as your lungs take a large breath. He can see fire spring from his blade, or the wind pushing objects around him. His mind frames him into one of his mangas, the hero, wielding mystical chi powers.

For Jason, the experience is somewhat similar, and yet vastly different. The air around him suddenly has a tangible presence, but instead of the immediate sense of combustion barely held at bay, he senses the air as something tightly bound together. And yet, it is a binding Jason now feels as if he can loose at will. And not only the air... he can sense a lesser echo in the people around him, and in his own flesh, realizing that those powerful bonds also hold living things together.

For Marcus, the change is as weird a thing as he's ever felt, though once he realizes what it means he has to laugh. In his mind he envisions himself in a swirling vortex of business cards, invoices, contracts, and print outs. Mixed in that whirlwind of documents is a battered and much-used coloring book, a copy of The Gettysburg Address, and a little black book.

The whipping flotsam in Marcus' mind grows more dense as every note he's ever written, every book he's ever read, and every ream of paper his company has ever produced appear. Marcus realizes he can sense them, he can recognize each scrap without even looking. He doesn't have to touch the paper to know how brittle it has become or how sturdy it is. The scent of the fresh 20lb letterhead he's used for years comes to him without the need to get near it.

It is then that Marcus feels the paper around him. Reaching out tentatively for the first time, he sends a business card leaping from his pocket. Marcus snares the paper out of the air and smiles at Aura. "Thank you! I honestly don't know what I'm going to use this for yet, but I have a feeling that--assuming I don't wake up from what would be a very strange dream--my life has just changed radically."

Aura smiles sadly. "Do you see that device there?" she asks, pointing a lithe finger at one of Toby's large, portable power-saws. "This device - as I see - would be very harmful to you if you did not know how to use it, but were given it. There will be many people on this planet who are now somehow linked, but don't have the control which I've given you. They.. will use that link in the manner of a novice with this saw."

"Stopping that from happening is what I hope you will use these links to do."

Colin nods. "I will do this as long as I am able."

"Makes sense," Jason replies, somewhat distracted - looking at his own hand as if he'd never seen it before.

"What do we need to do to stop them?" asks Marcus. "Can we just bring them to you so they can get the control they need?"

Aura nods. "If the linked individual is violent, he must be restrained. Once that is done, I can remove the link from him." She glances at Toby. "Right now, I don't know who should or should not have a link. I must leave that decision to all of you."

"This isn't just a matter for us to decide," replies Marcus. "America's leaders need to know. This could put thousands of lives at stake, and a normal soldier wouldn't have a chance."

"Or they will take our Aura away and do unspeakable things with her hardware," mutters Toby darkly. "You should not trust these government people too far!"

"Well, let's think of this carefully," says Marcus. "Who is going to find these people fastest. Will it be us, or the FBI?"

"You are smarter than me, Mr. Marcus," concedes Toby. It's probably true, but he's man enough to own up to it. "But! They cannot take Aura anywhere she doesn't wish to go. They cannot just march into _my_ junkyard. So, do what you wish."

"Well, Toby, you know I don't have any interest in that either. Aura should be afforded the full rights she deserves, and your junkyard is yours, as well." Marcus smiles, "And fortunately we have just the person we can negotiate all these terms with. After all, we have a lot to offer now, don't we? Let's go have a chat with Mr. Floyd."

"These other bits... they could've fallen anywhere, right?" asks Jason. "So I guess we're gonna need some help." He shakes his head. "O'course, if one of these... rogue links pops up, I'd guess they could cause an awful lot of trouble." He looks up at the air, grabs hold of a handful of it, and chins himself, then lets go, to sit on nothing. "So yeah."

Colin crosses his arms across his chest. "You're all welcome to associate with the fuzz..." But he will follow the others...

Floyd apparently found his coffee, and drinks it while conferring with the National Guard Colonel. "Look, let me try this one more time: you didn't see bullets deflecting in mid-air, that's physically impossible. This is a junk yard, right? So your guys come in firing all over the place, you're going to kick up some sparks. I was in Desert Storm, it happened all the time." He takes a sip, pointedly ignoring the Colonel's scowl. "It's just another crash of another experimental aircraft. Happens all the time in Nevada. Wouldn't expect you to see it here again."

The older soldier calls for his men to clear out, with an unmistakable air of disgust. Floyd turns to Toby's vagabond posse and grins. "Best to stay out of their way for the moment. Some less trigger-happy folks are on their way from Livermore. So. Until then, what shall we talk about?"

Marcus smiles at Floyd, "Well, unless you want to make a career out of damage control, you will want to hear a few more things about this little event and how serious things are about to become."

Floyd loses his smile and tosses the empty paper cup into a nearby barrel. "Already is. So let's get to it."

The paper cup falls into the barrel only to leap out and into Marcus' hand. He doesn't catch it in the normal sense. The cup floats over his open hand. For a moment it spins in place, than grows still. A quick thought and it crumples utterly. Another and it springs back into its original shape.. but without wrinkles. "Now imagine I could do this with, say, the steel of a skyscraper. Or the dome of the capital."

"This little event has apparently made others capable of doing something like I can. Like we all can now. But they have no control and probably don't all share our moral stances or political allegiance," says Marcus.

"And not all of them will have as much common sense as Marcus here," adds Jason, unable to resist a brief glance at Colin.

The color drain's from Floyd's face. "Because of the alien?" he asks.

Colin's head cranes back, and looks at Jason. He says nothing, but pulls his mouth open in a large, toothy smile.

"At least it seems that way," says Marcus. "Now she's given us these talents so we might be able to deal with these rogues. Essentially we need to bring them to her and they can have their abilities turned off." Marcus draws in a breath and smiles more certainly, "Of course, we have a need of support to do this effectively, and I personally want to ensure that our police and armed forces aren't sent off like lambs to slaughter. Oh, and I think these young men will probably need some kind of salary for the job."

Floyd's cheery demeanor is leaving almost as quickly as the soldiers. "Yeah, figured it couldn't be that simple. All right. Here's the deal. I'm on direct Presidential order to keep this from turning into a mess. I'll tell you what I've learned in fifteen years of Federal service: you don't screw Uncle Sam. You want to be part of the solution, I'm game for that. Don't make me figure out what to do, if you become part of the problem."

"Wouldn't think of it," replies Marcus. "So let's work out something equitable, then I want some time for my friends to have a chance to carefully consider what I'm proposing before they leap off the cliff with me." He holds out a hand to Floyd, "I think this is a great start, sir. Let's build a consensus and defend the American people."

Floyd nods, and shakes Marcus' hand. "A deal is made."
