# Junkyard Heroes 2009-04-10

Colin has been taking the past week to work on his link. His new found powers. Spending more time in the dojo than normal, (if this is even possible), Colin has been working on developing the proper flow and chi for his new found link in with his normal kendo style. Moving and shaping the winds around himself, using them to facilitate sharper and faster strikes. Even walking on the air sometimes, dancing around an opponent. In theory, that is. Plans usually don't survive the first encounter with the enemy.

Marcus spends his time on the practical side of things. He meets regularly with Floyd and a few advisors to hammer out a few important details. On a lark, the amused CEO brings in a detailed and completely fake proposal for a movie. "You know, PR is important, and branding is critical to our success." His nights are spent practicing control and learning just what it means to control paper. It's not the most potent material at first blush, but with effort he's found ways to will it to greater strength.

Floyd watches the supermen practice from a corner of the room, with his omnipresent coffee cup. "I'm almost afraid to ask what you mean by 'branding'. How do you brand secrets?"

"Just trying to put your hackles up, Floyd," comes Marcus' reply. "We can't really do a movie about anything real. If people knew the full story there'd probably be hysterics in half a dozen cities. First sign of trouble and people would be screaming and and fleeing their homes."

Floyd chuckles. "So glad you see it my way. Seriously, I don't think it's as bad as all that. Sooner or later, every story needs to be told. The people have a right to know. Just... not _yet_."

Meanwhile Jason, being a science student, has taken a more scientific approach to exploring his newfound powers. At his next chem lab class, he used his Link to fill a beaker, and with a few tests, discovered that his element was, simply, nitrogen. The rest of the week was spent buried in the library, looking through every book on nitrogen chemistry he could find. Oh, and one other book - on the use of nitromethane racing fuel. He has no idea if poor Silver could survive nitro power, but by god he's going to try.

And, of course, it's in the interest of trying that very thing that Jason is back at Toby's junkyard, looking through the tiny handful of sports car junkers for any parts he can use to turbocharge an ancient Buick.

Floyd's mobile phone rings. It's bulky, but nothing says 'I'm a Fed' louder in this day and age than a trenchcoat and a phone with no wires. "O'Shea," he answers, and hangs up a moment later. "Those guys from JPL are a few minutes away. I want to be there to make sure everyone gets along. You're welcome to join me but try to avoid breaking the laws of physics in the first hour, OK?"

"It's best if we go. It will keep Toby from getting jumpy, I think," replies Marcus. "And we need to make sure everyone plays by the right rules."

---

By hook or by crook, everyone of interest has a reason to be at the junkyard today. Colin received a call; Jason has a personal interest in the prosaic function of the business; and Floyd and Marcus appear in the name of Mr. Lazarus's new side-line. It doesn't take long for the government man's liaison to report something to him, though: parts of the wreckage, and important parts by the look of it, have already been removed. Nor was there any sign of damage (or damage that they could hope to detect...). The removal was done professionally.

There is one more here today, aside from Toby and Aura, who have become inseparable despite her apparent inability to get up and walk around. A blond-haired, boyishly handsome man is speaking with the pair as Floyd and Marcus enter the office. He turns and smiles. Toby grins broadly.

"Mr. Government!" he calls. "My friend, Captain Ellis Tove. Comrade, this is Mr. Floyd of the government."

Floyd nods, and extends a hand. "Floyd O'Shea, FBI. You're Air Force?"

Captain Tove nods and grins, returning a firm handshake. "Mr. O'Shea. Toby's told me a lot about you, sir." He salutes smartly to Marcus in turn.

Floyd says, "Well. Now I'm in trouble," Floyd jokes. "We might all be. Doctor Wingley - that's the rocket scientist in the yard - tells me that pieces of the wreck are missing. I sincerely hope that's due to the actions of someone in this room, because it means that we stand a chance in Hell of finding them. Otherwise we've got a problem."

"Captain, it's a pleasure to see you again sir," replies Marcus. He returns the salute with a serious expression that is quickly replaced with his usual smile. "I have a feeling now isn't the time to swap stories, unfortunately," he adds, nodding at Floyd.

Toby glances at Captain Tove for a moment, then nods quickly. "Yes. Yes. Some of the elements in the craft are unstable in the long term, Mr. Floyd. So I took them and I have been building a holding room for it."

Floyd thinks back to the results of the background check into Tobacek Lazuriewizc, the junkman. An immigrant from the Old Country - but with the assistance of the Captain, who married Toby's paraplegic sister and since returned to a posting on American soil. The junkman himself soon followed. There's no sign of criminal background, although plenty of corners were cut to get the man into the country in a timely fashion.

But one thing is for sure - he doesn't have the skill set to dismantle alien hardware unassisted.

"That's a good idea," Floyd allows, "but all the same, don't you think we should take inventory? Make sure that all of it's there? Miss Aura, I'm sure you can tell if he's got a complete set or not, right?"

Aura shakes her head. "You see, this machinery was not created by my people," she explains. "I understand its operation because of my maturation into form, but I don't know its full contents."

"Your maturation into form?" asks Marcus.

The feminine form smiles widely at Marcus, her metal and crystalline face turning to look at him. "I was not born to look like the people of this planet," she says gently. "I am still in my nascent state, but in their native condition, my people are unformed."

Marcus raises an eyebrow at the explanation. "That must be a very interesting civilization," he muses.

Floyd refills his coffee cup. "I thought you didn't remember where you came from," he asks, and takes a sip. "How sure are you, of where you're going?"

Aura shakes her head. "Some part of the ship must know. Some record of its journey, its.. black box?" She stares quizzically at Captain Tove, who nods and steps in to explain. "It's a guess, but a logical one," he says. "Any sort of craft will have a flight recorder and navigational charts. You don't just throw it out into space and hope it lands in the right spot."

"That sounds logical enough, but are we likely to recognize it when we see it?" asks Marcus.

"As I become more formed, I will harmonize more closely with the wreckage," Aura explains. "I was able to warn Toby about the.. the.." She pauses to search for a word. "The dangerous bad thing which turns. It's locked away now, and stable."

"And you were able to easily disassemble this alien craft?" asks Marcus of Toby. It's clear he's a bit surprised. "Is it similar to our own construction?"

"It has iron in it," grins the junk-man, flexing his hands.

Colin laughs at this.

"You know, it is interesting," says Marcus. "It can't be coincidence that you control iron and I have paper."

Toby shrugs. "Echt. I think other metals too, but yes, I'm very proud." He grins at Aura, who smiles back radiantly.

Floyd has a look out the office's dusty window, and waves cheerily at the scientists, who are conversing excitedly in the yard outside. "Rock, paper. Who has scissors?" Another pull at his coffee mug. "This could change everything. You think the world is ready for that?"

"Does the world even have a choice at this point?" asks Marcus.

Colin says, "I rather thought the point was that the world was not ready..."

"The world wasn't ready for nuclear bombs either," points out Jason. "And yet here we are."

Floyd says, "Well... that is my point. I was trying to be, what's the word, 'rhetorical'."

"And here we are," repeats Marcus. "So, how do we deal with the matter of missing dangerous parts, Floyd?"

"They aren't missing," grumbles Toby.

"That's the problem, it sounds like they need to be kept contained, but can we tell the scientists that?" asks Marcus. "Will they decide they know best and ignore the danger?"

Floyd says, "I think those guys have seen enough for one day," Floyd says. "What I'm more concerned about is the missing Links. Other people that do what you do, but without as many scruples. Or a Fed keeping them honest."

"I imagine you can just pick up a newspaper," observes Captain Tove drily. "But I'm in the area for awhile and I'm going to work with you all if I can, and see if we can come up with a solution."

Marcus nods at the Captain, "We appreciate it. I would rather not have to wait for a reporter to find them. Who knows what someone might do by accident or by malice?"

Floyd pulls on his coat. "I'll go and escort our rocket science friends out. Then I'll see what the Bureau can turn up. Bad news tends to flow to Washington."

"That helps explain a lot of what comes out of it, too," replies Marcus.

Floyd grimaces as he opens the door. "Some of us believe in what we do," he says flatly, and then he's outside.

As Floyd departs, Jason pipes up. "Hey, Colin. Didja ever figure out exactly what it is you're controlling?"

Colin smiles at Jason. "Oxygen, it seems. Moving the air around us about. What about you, Jason?"

Jason grins. "Nitrogen. So between the two of us we control like 98 percent of the atmosphere. Now that's a hell of a thing."

Toby once again opens up, with the Fed gone. "Jason, you know the '60 Eldorado Seville?" he asks excitedly. "I have installed some of the components I gathered from the wreck of dear Aura's ship. Now I want your help. Actually both of you. Come remove the rust and help me with the assemblies, eh? Mr. Marcus, Captain, will you come too?"

Colin laughs. "Is that so?" His hand moves to where the hilt of his sword or bokken would be. He doesn't carry it all the time, as one might think. Colin is beginning to demonstrate his walk on air trick as Toby addresses him, "Anything you say, boss."

"Toby, as much as the government can make a mess of things," begins Marcus, "I'm not interested in deceiving Floyd. He's been a straight shooter and you know how I stand when it comes to deception."

Toby leads the way out of his office - first stopping to unfold a wheelchair. He assists Aura into it, and she smiles gratefully. This done, he leads the motley procession out into the yard and off into one corner. "Mr. Floyd!" he calls as he goes. "Come see where your dangerous doodads got off to!"

"You didn't tell me she couldn't walk, Toby," remarks Ellis as they go. Toby shrugs and keeps wheeling. The Air Force Captain hums. "Just like Shala." Toby scowls, and still says nothing.

In the corner of the yard is an old 1960 Cadillac Eldorado Seville. The hood has been taken off entirely. Emerging from the car is what looks to be a pile of scrap metal, but upon closer inspection it's an artfully arranged facade. Underneath is a much more modern-looking collection of machinery whose purpose frankly baffles its witnesses.

"It won't fit into the engine block," Toby observes mournfully. "I had such hopes for this car."

Colin nudges Jason in the ribs, "Is that what the Buick looks like?"

"Toby, what exactly are you making?" asks Marcus. "I understand you have a link and can do something with metals, but just because I can move paper doesn't mean I know the language of every page I touch. I guess I'm just not clear on how you know what these parts do."

"I link to more than metal," Toby grins. "I link to Aura as well." The metallic woman smiles politely, bobbing her head in agreement. "So I am learning what she knows, and she also learns from me."

Jason is too busy looking at the conglomeration. "Hmm... yeah, I don't see any way to get that lot in any further. If that's as big as it's gonna be, you'd need something like a truck if you wanted to fit it." He puts a hand on the side of the car. "What'dja do with the engine?"

Marcus nods slowly, understanding Toby and filing that away for later discussion with the others. "That is one interesting link, I imagine."

Toby scowls at Jason. "Listen, my friend. You are young and wise in many things, but a 1960 Cadillac engine is handmade by Italians. It is not even worth selling as scrap. You would serve yourself much better with a Hemi. Please, take my advice and do not ruin your life."

Jason nods glumly. "That's a shame," he says. "Nah, I didn't want it for myself." He reaches out hesitantly to the more alien components. "Just a shame that it had to go... even if it was to..." He pauses. "Actually, what _is_ this s'posed to do?"

"My dad put Cadillacs together for GM," Floyd says quietly. "He's Irish. Like me. Still... he wouldn't recognize... whatever this is," he trails off.

"This ah..." Toby thinks a moment. "I don't know what this is, to be quite honest, comrades. But it is a machine that contains the spinning badness that Aura is worried about. So you see, it is like a refrigerator almost. We have some cooling and venting over here... and you see the wiring, like a motor's brushes over here, and we had to add some windings to keep it from making that noise. So... oh yes, also we weighed it down to keep it from flying away."

"But! That is why I had hopes. You see, comrades, if I can _control_ it, we could have a flying car!"

"So essentially what you have is a really angry power source?" ventures Marcus.

Colin arches an eyebrow, "A flying car...." He looks over into the car, "About how much are you using to weigh it down?"

"So there is about 16 tons of metal here," muses Toby. "I'm afraid the soil here isn't going to hold up very well. I excavated last year when the phone company wanted to put their cords in past my property. Very bad soil. I'm going to have to rent a backhoe again. Mr. Floyd, Mr. Marcus, I may need to call on your services, comrades."

"Oh my God," Floyd moans. "When you said you were putting it somewhere safe, I thought maybe you had, I don't know, a bomb shelter or something hidden in this rubble. You're telling me that you put the engine from the crashed UFO... in a Cadillac? Hell. Guess I should be glad it's not a Pinto." He pulls out his phone. "OK. So this time it's the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. And a crane."

"If you remove it from the container, it may do unusual things which you would have trouble explaining," observes Toby slyly. "Plus I didn't like the look of it going in, and I doubt its mood has much improved."

Colin scrates his arm a bit, and glances over to Floyd. "You know, I don't like all these Government types around here all the time, Toby..."

Toby sighs. "You will be fine, comrade. Mr. Floyd is our friend now! And we will cooperate with him as much as we can, Mr. Marcus, please rest your laurels about that."

Floyd either misses the interplay, or ignores it for the moment. He glances at Aura while navigating FedLand's needlessly complex phone directory. "Isn't this going to be a movie next year, about some kind of warp drive? With Jodie Foster? Makes holes in space?"

Marcus nods to Toby, "Glad to hear it. We were brought together for a reason, so we should take extra care to build trust. Without it, our unit won't stand a chance. Speaking of which, I think we're going to need some kind of training to better use our skills and to learn to work together. We can't just wing it."

"That, hopefully, will be my job," Captain Tove explains with a smile. "I declined Toby's offer of a link, for hmm, various reasons. But I'm still willing to help out, as full-time as I can manage."

Colin crosses his arms over his chest.

"That's very generous, Captain," replies Marcus. "And it will serve us well, I think. We can't face a rogue link without preparation."

"But Mr. Floyd should not be talking about removing dangerous things," Toby grumbles. "He does not understand."

"I'm not removing anything," Floyd says, a touch defensively. "I promised that these things would stay in your possession, and they will. That's just as real as Aura's passport." He puts away his phone, sensing that the alien engine is not an urgent problem after all.

Toby scowls. "Hey! Come here." He grabs Floyd by the arm, dragging him off from the others as he begins to berate the man. "You people are going too far with her. She is fine, I will take care of her, she'll be happy here, you're meddling..." But once he's far enough away, his voice lowers dramatically, speaking only to Floyd. "Mr. O'Shea, I thank you sir. But please. Let us talk about this away from others next time." He fidgets briefly, then walks back toward the group and yells again. "And that'll be a lesson to you!"

Jason has missed most of the discussion, being too busy hovering over the Cadillac. "Flying, eh..." he says. "Wonder how you'd hook up the controls..." He looks in the window, poking at the steering column and muttering to himself. "We'd almost have to get a tilt steering wheel in here to provide up-down... unless we can get a yoke out of a small plane..."

"If we're going to make something that flies, why not just use a jet?" asks Marcus. "It looks a little less suspicious than a flying car, don't you think?"

Colin blinks at the old man seems to explode in emotion. He jumps a bit to the side as Toby takes Floyd away for a good tongue lashing.

Colin gives Marcus a .. look. "You have no romantic soul, do you?"

Colin turns back to Jason, "If it's just a floaty dohicky, wouldn't we need some way to go forward and back?"

Floyd remains were he was led for a moment, looking bewildered. Finally he walks away, in the direction of the coffee pot.

"This isn't a time for romance," replies Marcus. "This is a time for careful planning and rational thought. What we're signing up for will probably start landing us in some pretty hot water, and it could come really quick."

Jason doesn't look up. "Gas pedal and brake are fine for that, probably. Though... yeah, probably need something cleverer than that. Maybe we could rig up something on the steering column..." He's got his head in the window of the car by this point, and anything other than flying cars is making no impression on him at all.

Colin grins at Marcus, "Are you always this fun to be around? I mean, seriously, if you think about the concequenses of everything, you'd never do anything. Heck, the dingus that they have weighted down with 16 tons in this car could be streaming out huge amounts of radiation."

"Son, if you consider the consequences of doing nothing, you will never stop achieving," replies Marcus.

Jason finally emerges. "Of course, it's all a moot point until we figure out how to control it at all," he says. "And I guess that's up to Toby and Aura, cause they're the only ones who seem to have any handle on how it all works." He looks between Marcus and Colin. "Uh... what're you guys talking about?"

"There is no radiation," murmurs Aura. "Or at least, if I understand your use of the word correctly. The technology is the same as the links. It never radiates."

Colin shrugs at Jason, "The impracticality of flying cars, it would seem. Apparentally we should all drive Volvos.:"

"Taking chances, I'd say," says Marcus. "But since we've all signed up to put ourselves squarely in the line of fire, it's pretty hard to call anyone excessively cautious, don't you think?"

Colin just shrugs.

"I was thinking of making the whole junk yard fly," announces Toby nonchalantly.

Colin looks back at Toby, "I think you have more than 16 tons of material here, boss."

The scrapyard owner grins. "Ahh, but that is just the spinning thing in its un-energized state!"

"Wouldn't you think that might draw a bit of attention?" asks Marcus. "Plus it's rather hard for people to use a junk yard if it's floating out of reach."

Toby hums. "To be honest, Mr. Marcus, I am hoping for a fat government job as alien ship consultant now, yes? And if not, well, junk business was never very mobile to begin with. We can now tow your wreck right to the yard. Also, do you realize that I pay $450 a month to those thieves at the landfill?"

A light seems to go on. "Property taxes," he breathes. "You see. I pay no taxes if I am not taking up land, eh? Eh? Pretty smart."

Colin says, "I'd ignore Mr. Marcus today. He was being a wet blanket about the flying car idea too. "

Floyd returns, with a foam cup of coffee and an ill-concealed sulk. "You know, you can probably make this whole place fly. And Marcus could probably make the Declaration of Indepedence do the cha-cha. My God, you can't think this is a good idea! You want a job? Fine. You're on the payroll. We'll figure out which payroll, later. But this isn't you versus the government! It's... whatever is going on, versus the safety of the American people!" The cup slips from his grasp, spilling on the ground. Floyd looks genuinely agitated when it happens. "God dammit," he mutters.

Toby nods in agreement. "No, I am not against the government. I trust you, comrade Floyd. You have looked out for my friends and me, and I believe in you." He takes the hand recently emptied of its coffee, and shakes it vigorously. "Sir, I have my dream. Please don't stand in its way. But I will follow your wishes as well, and support this great country of America."

"I'm with Floyd on this one," says Marcus. "And unless there's a different oath in the Air Force, I imagine the Captain is in agreement too. I'm more than a little concerned by what I'm hearing. If anything, I'm more convinced than ever of the danger of rogue links."

Toby lets out a quiet sigh. His manic energy seems to drain out of him, and his eyes now meet those of the people around him. "Then. Tell me, if I cannot do this, how will I get Aura home?" he asks.

"If that's your goal, why not try a location that isn't so likely to draw every curious eye on the globe? Do you have to work here, Toby?" asks Marcus. "With a bit of help from Floyd we could get you access to the best materials and give you space where you can work without interruption."

Toby regards Floyd slowly. "Well?" he asks.

Floyd shrugs. "You know, most people in the government don't believe in aliens. That's God's honest truth. I've seen all the files. There were no little green men at Roswell. No face on Mars. It all drove old man Hynek nuts. But... if there's a way to do it, we'll find it. And if not?" He directs his next comment at Aura. "You're welcome to call this place home. There is honor to be found here."

Aura smiles slightly. "Thank you, Mr. O'Shea," she says quietly. But her delicately defined eyebrows furrow nonetheless.

"I will accept help from my friends," Toby says firmly. "But please. Let me do this."

Floyd nods a few times. "As you wish."

"Toby, it might help us if we better understand why you want to do these things," says Marcus. "You've always been enthusiastic to make things, especially the unusual and cool, and I can see that coming through. It's just that the stakes have changed a lot, and for us the big focus is on keeping people safe." He looks to the others, "Right?"

Toby nods. "So, comrades. Let us talk about these important government matters for a moment." He pauses, smiling at Aura. "Please excuse me." She smiles brightly and nods her assent, and the junkyard owner leads the rest of the pack away a short distance.

Toby lets out a short sigh. "My friends, I have never been so happy. I know Aura very well, and she knows me. So you see, I must do everything I can to help her. It's a man's duty, you understand. She is everything and everyone I always wanted, do you understand? But I cannot tell her yet. I have so much to do before I can tell her."

Marcus' eyebrows both shoot up, "Toby, are you trying to tell me that you are in love with our guest? Why didn't you tell us that before! I was worried that you were crazy from the link, now I know you're just crazy for more normal reasons." He slaps his friend on the back, "Don't scare me like that!"

Toby flushes, looking distinctly embarrassed. "Yes, well, Mr. Marcus, you have known me for long enough that you should know better."

"Yes, but I also knew long enough that nobody can control oxygen, or nitrogen, or metal with their mind, and look how far that is going to get me in the world now," answers Marcus. He can't stop grinning, "If we weren't under heavy observation by who knows what agency I'd say we should hit a good pub to celebrate."

Floyd doesn't seem to understand at first. "People do things for their own reasons," he finally states. "Love is better than most of them."

"Love is the best reason of all," agrees Marcus.

Toby nods. "Are you married, Mr. Floyd?" he asks.

Floyd seems about to speak, but just shakes his head once.

"A shame." But then the junkman grins. "And too bad for you I have only one sister! Well, my friends. I am quite serious when I say that it may be difficult to move the spinning thing, but I am confident that it is as safe here as anywhere else. So, we must decide what we will allow me to do, and then do it, eh?"

"Well, Toby, with you and Aura being the only experts there's no reason to move it until you say it makes sense," says Marcus. "If you need something, you know I'm good for it. I have a few stock options that are kicking in, and I wouldn't mind a bit of diversification with an investment in your business. Probably be the best move I've ever made with my money."

Toby responds with more than characteristic intensity. "We will have a very profitable business soon," he promises.

---

In the next day or two, Captain Ellis Tove's true value becomes readily apparent to everyone. After observation, he's concluded that Toby and Aura are progressing in their understanding at about the same pace, and that Aura knows approximately what Toby does. Based on that, he's called in a former college professor, Dr. Chastity Williams, who will be instructing Aura in the basics of science and technology as Earth understands it. Behind her sweet face is locked the understanding of this alien technology, and the Captain believes language is the key. For Toby, he trusts Marcus to handle what the junkman is missing: perspective.

"If Aura can tell _us_ what she knows, _we_ can get the most out of what we see," he explains. True enough, the group working together soon come up with a way to track the rogue links. Based on Aura's explanation, all the links somehow tie together with a sort of invisible, higher-dimensional thread. Toby, Colin and Jason work up a compass of sorts, which by its nature must be mounted somewhere immobile, which will show the direction to the nearest link. It takes awhile longer to figure out how to exclude themselves, but Toby is convinced that the problem can be solved.
