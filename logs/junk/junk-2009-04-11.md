# Junkyard Heroes 2009-04-11

Satisfied that his old friend is not suffering from an unnatural insanity, but rather a very natural one, Marcus wanted to find a time to talk, like before things got so weird. A quick call to make sure the schedule is clear and Marcus finds himself arriving at 8 PM, bringing along a brown bag in which Toby's favorite drink is safely concealed.

Toby's house is a simple one-story, two-bedroom apartment. It has that subtle alienness of decor that many immigrants seem to adopt, along with a plethora of photographs and a dizzying array of trinkets, curios, and other mementos of his time in America.

Aura has been set up in what was once Toby's home office. Despite his directness, he is still a businessman, and the signs of a hasty clearing of his LLC's paperwork to make way for a bed and such are clear.

Marcus always feels relaxed visiting the home of his friend. He can't put his finger on it exactly, but somehow it helps him believe that the American Dream is still alive and kicking. He greets Toby with a friendly handshake and a grin, "I brought the usual! It's good to see things are working out well for you. I still remember all the challenges I had when I first moved in with my wife... that was what? A hundred years ago or so?"

Toby smiles quietly. Some of his energy is gone, but he's still got a twinkle in his eye and a firm handshake. "Well, Mr. Marcus, then a woman has been happy with your one hundred years. You are blessed."

Marcus laughs, "More blessed every day, my friend. And this new excitement is quite welcome, honestly. The world feels like a newer place, somehow."

"Well, er. I had to fix some things up." Toby shuffles his feet. "The plumbing needed some cleaning, and uh, I had laundry that needed to be cleaned. You understand."

Marcus nods, "I imagine things are a lot easier to do, with your new gift. I'm still figuring things out, but.." He leans in conspiratorially and finishes, "I found something really amazing that I can do. Sometime I gotta show you. I totally understand your excitement now. It's hard to keep myself from being reckless."

Toby nods, grinning. "Oh, very well comrade. What is it?"

"Well, I have some extra paper in the bag," he explains. "But it's not really enough, and I don't want to make trouble in the neighborhood." He takes out a few sheets of paper and holds them up, slowly changing it into the form of a dragon. "Imagine something like this, only bigger," Marcus says. "It's not much for talking, but I bet it'll be pretty useful."

Toby coos approvingly. "Yes, very nice comrade. Do you know how big it might be yet?"

"Not yet," admits Marcus. "But I figure a trip to the mill will give me a much better idea. Speaking of which, I have a question. Have you been practicing? It's clear you are really good with your link. Is it because of Aura, or just practice?"

With the conversation clearly getting more serious, Marcus follows his friend to the dining table and in a familiar ritual crack open their first beers together with a toast to life, happiness, and profit. This complete, they get back to business.

"She is very very skilled," says Toby, sketching invisible diagrams with his finger across the surface of the dining room table. "I understand better now. Imagine that there is a spiderweb, which spreads out from the crash, yes? It connects all the Links. The Links then root into our brains. It is all a single large machine."

"And that is why we will be able to find the others," muses Marcus. "Do you know what happens when we get all the links?" he asks.

Toby shrugs. "Then we retire?"

"I wonder." Marcus shrugs in turn and takes a longer drink. "I'm not sure about the retiring business. My wife keeps telling me to do that. What does someone do when they have nothing on their shoulders anyway?"

"You think you'll have nothing on your shoulders?" Toby laughs out loud. "Comrade, your world will be there waiting for you. Work is the distraction from our true business."

"Speaking of that, how long do you imagine it will be before we run into our first bit of trouble?" asks Marcus. "You know, it's been a while for me, but I've at least been trained a bit. I hope your friend the Captain can help get all of us up to speed."

Toby shrugs. "I don't know. We _know_ what we possess, so we may choose to use it. How long until someone uses it without knowing? No man can say."

Marcus turns back to what Toby had said earlier. "So right now the links are all attached to someone.. they are out there, possibly in use. It's just a matter of us not knowing who, or where." He looks to his friend seriously, "Does everyone have a different link?"

Toby turns at a sound; Marcus hears it a moment after. It is Aura, wheeling her self into the dining room in her wheelchair. The sight is momentarily incongruous: a woman made of metal and crystal, a faint radiance adorning her, using a tool for the infirm. "Hello Marcus," she says with a bright smile. "I think I can tell you more about the links, if that is what you wish to know."

Marcus stands and moves over to greet Aura with a friendly hug. He returns to his seat, making sure to clear room for her to sit by Toby. "Miss Aura, I would like to know more about them, but I am concerned. Are you alright?" He frowns as a thought occurs to him, "There's no way for a link to find out where you are, is there?"

"It doesn't work like that," smiles Aura. "The machinery of the link sits, um, sideways to the world. It touches it in certain bands, or ranges, like an FM radio, I think? This is why you can discern your linked element, but nothing else - it pokes through the planet in the places where that element can be found."

"But if you followed the threads back, you would not follow them through your three dimensions. You would follow them through other spaces. And so while we might be connected, you cannot locate me."

"That's good," says Marcus. "I was concerned that a link may track it back here and decide to do something unpleasant. Of course, they might be able to learn to track us. Right now, though, it's not likely they'd suspect that others have their power."

Aura smiles patiently. "If they had our machines, perhaps they could build another compass. But it would still need to be near the center of the link machinery. I have no fear. Please don't worry about this, Marcus."

"You are the expert!" Marcus grins and ventures, "I don't suppose you appreciate beer, do you Miss Aura?" He seems to like the extra formality. There's something about Aura that demands a bit more respect. "Toby here has a very good taste for these things. This particular brew goes best with old friends and conversation."

The woman pauses, looking downward for a moment. "I don't know.. I don't know if I'm even capable of drinking. Or eating," she says at last. "How would I find out?"

"Well, hmm." Marcus looks to Toby, then back to Aura. "I guess for humans it just comes naturally. My best guess is that you probably don't need to if you haven't already. Do you need to breathe or sleep?"

Toby, when glanced at, gives that helpless shrug. His face spells out the whole message: _I tried, but I have no idea_.

Aura shakes her head. "I rest, but I don't breathe."

"I think if you don't need food, it's probably wisest not to try," agrees Marcus.

The conversation turns away from the lofty and serious for the rest of the night. Marcus and Toby have been friends for long enough that they don't really need much to talk about to enjoy each other's company, and Aura, no matter how alien she might appear to most, is seamlessly integrated into things. Only when it hits eleven does Marcus finally say his goodbyes, the one beer having had its time to clean out of his system. The CEO has a lot to think about, but he's resting easy, knowing that for some reason, his ability to change the world has grown considerably.
