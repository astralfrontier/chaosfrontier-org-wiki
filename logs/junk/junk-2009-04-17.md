# Junkyard Heroes 2009-04-17

Toby has called another meeting of his Linked allies, along with Floyd and Captain Tove. "Captain Tove has made a suggestion I wish to run you over with, Mr. Floyd," the junkman announces. "He tells me about aviator call signs and code names, for secrecy. If we are acting, we should not give ourselves away, yes?"

Colin beams a smile at Toby. "I've always thought that being a bit more, undercover about this sort of operation would shield us from many.. unfortunate side effects of saving the world."

Floyd looks bemused at the junk man's choice of words. "Call signs, sure, but saving the world? Aren't we getting a bit ahead of things?"

Colin looks at Floyd, "Isn't that what we're talking about here, though. I mean, seriously, I don't think Toby or Aura ould disagree with my assessment."

Floyd shrugs. "I guess that depends on how much faith you have in the average person to use superhuman power wisely."

"Eventually that may be exactly what we do," says Marcus. "Right now I don't think I have quite enough firepower to make the claim." He looks to Toby, "I take it you have something in mind?"

Colin glares at Marcus. . o O ( His designation should be sourpuss ). He turns back to Floyd. "The average person? maybe not much. But I don't think Toby has selected average people."

Floyd chews his lower lip. "No. He didn't, did he?" The fed looks lost in thought.

The Captain steps in at this point, speaking to Floyd. "The proposal, sir, is to open a new project, classify it, and delegate authority within the project to the civilians already involved in it. Those civilians will then operate under the guidance of a duly appointed civilian deputee of the United States - presumably you."

Floyd nods. "That is, in essence, my advice to the Bureau. We're still fuzzy on some of the particulars, though. Remember, we solved the crisis with the military by classifying this as a civil aviation accident. We all know that's a stretch. So what authority am I asking the American people to delegate here?"

The Captain thinks a moment. "You're deputizing these people as an arm of federal law enforcement, tackling a potential outbreak of mass destruction."

"Gentlemen," interrupts Marcus, "I did have a question. The designated authorities of the American people seem to be jumping into this quite eagerly. What is causing this level of cooperation? I have every reason to trust my good friend's judgement concerning the Links and Aura, but why is the US of A so willing to do so?"

Toby coughs. "I will tell you why, comrades," he says more quietly. "Captain Tove showed Aura and myself a movie. It is called 'Forbidden Planet'. In it, there is a machine which gives great power to these alien men, but their minds are not prepared for it. They destroy themselves because of the sins they hide away, yes? The links are the same."

"We all have been given control by the angel. But what about others?"

Floyd frowns. "The truth is murky. You might as well go with what Toby said. But keep this in mind: we had a guy in a junkyard talking about angels and aliens. We had a military standoff. Since Waco, we're a little more careful about where we point our guns. And I distinctly remember Assitant Director Hart saying 'Not in an election year.'" He shrugs again. "My superiors understand that this is a real problem and I think I can convince them that you're the best way to deal with it. But I'm not going to bullshit you. We're off the books. You don't get badges. We keep this quiet, clean up the mess, everyone lives happily ever after. In thirty years it gets declassified, they make a movie about it. You guys all get played by the rising stars of 2020's and do book deals. I get set up as the evil spook that tried to cover it all up, I probably get played by Gary Oldman. The end."

Toby laughs. "Well then comrades. Let us be very quiet when we save the world. And now, Aura has said that the wreckage of the ship may yield more information. She was captured, you know. We might find out who did such a thing."

Colin looks back at Toby. "She was captured?" Colin looks over at Aura, then back at Toby. "Captured usually means taken away, you know, boss..."

Aura smiles brightly. "I was taken from my home in my unformed state. I believe that I was sent here and that there might be more information about my capture in the ship."

Colin tries to figure this out, "So, at some point in time, you were taken. And so you were sent here to find out about the point in time, in the past, that you were taken from... something?"

The alien angel shakes her head. "I don't think so. I think you might say... kidnapped as a child, and sent to live in a foreign country?"

Colin nods. "Right. But after that event, possibly way in the past, you were sent here to find out about your capture? "

Jason shakes his head. "Nnnnot exactly. I don't think she said _why_ she was sent here. The ship she was in crashed here, and then Toby linked with her, and she started... forming?"

Aura answers with a dazzling smile. "Yes, that is how it is."

"Let's have another look at the ship," Floyd suggests. "The JPL guys have gone home for the moment. Toby took out the dangerous parts. Maybe someone left a note." _Recorded by Marlon Brando, maybe._

Toby wheels Aura outside. She regards the monument of the alien wreckage for a moment, then smiles and claps her hand happily. "Yes, there it is." She reaches a hand out, passing it through the bulk of the wreck as though it weren't there, and withdraws clutching a sparkling conglomeration of light-motes which dance about each other in a hypnotic pattern.

"Whoa. Now that's pretty," says Jason, whistling appreciatively. "You could make a fortune waving that around at a rave."

"Ahh, I was supposed to read this to you," she says after a few moments of consideration. Clearing her throat, she orates. "Attention intelligent beings of this planet. Our war machine has arrived to take possession of your resources. You will surrender yourselves to our governance while this takes place. Interference with our operations will result in loss of life and the destruction of your possessions."

Jason's face falls. "_That's_ not pretty."

Colin shakes his head, "It's always the pretty ones that let you down."

The angel looks up and around at the others. "Well, I don't think any of that happened, right?" she asks.

"Well, looks like saving the world is back on the agenda, boys," replies Marcus. "This would indicate, however, that a war machine has arrived." He looks to Aura, "Seems that the one referenced isn't quite ready to demand our surrender now."

Aura frowns in bemusement. "I don't _feel_ like conquering anything," she says at last. "Maybe I wasn't formed the way they thought I would be."

"Or maybe there was supposed to be something else aboard that was going to form you differently," says Jason. "Maybe something that was wrecked in the crash."

Colin looks over at Marcus, then at Aura, Toby, Jason, Floyd. "Quite possibly. Of course, I've never known a tactician to rely solely on his first wave."

With an almost ashamed look on her face, Aura tugs at Floyd's sleeve. "Do I still get that asylum?" she whispers.

The muscles are working in Floyd's jaw, indicating severe worry, or perhaps a recent root canal. Aura's plea takes him off-guard, innocent and pitiable as it is. "Yes," he finally says.

With that settled, Aura reaches into the ship again and seems to fish around with her hand. After a few moments, she pulls out a polyhedron of light which seems to float around her hand, changing the number of faces it has every few seconds. "Oh, and I think this will work for a container for links until I can find the real one," she says. "If you can subdue those with uncontrolled links, I can remove them and keep them in this."

Colin thinks about this for a moment. "Given your last statement.. subdue is where they can get up and walk away later, right?"

Floyd walks a few feet here and there, looking at the wreckage. "So the Links are all part of a weapon system, each one for a specific substance. And they'd only need one flying saucer to conquer the whole Earth?" He shakes his head, and nudges a piece of the wreckage with his toe. "Even Ed Wood had a bigger budget than that." He pauses. "But if you can control all substances, then... maybe you'd only need one. Hmm. If we recover the missing links, and you put them in your little jar, can you get them far the hell away from here? Like maybe, I dunno, Pluto?"

Aura smiles. "The links are simply parts of a larger machine, I believe. If we can hold down people, or get them to not interrupt me while I work, that will be sufficient. The removal should be harmless."

Colin looks at Floyd. "I think it might be better if she and the links stay here. Especially if there's a limited quantity, it might be nice not to give them back to Aura's people so they can try again...."

This causes the woman to frown deeply. "It is not my people who sent me here," she states emphatically.

"And it's not her people that worry me," Floyd adds.

"Yeah, I think Colin meant whoever captured her," says Jason. "And I think they worry the hell out of all of us."

"And **I** will build my ship," Toby insists. "But to make Mr. Floyd and Mr. Marcus happy, I will build it under the junk yard. We will lift off once everyone is happy. And until then, we have a place to go for this business."

"Toby, you are very understanding," says Marcus. "The big thing is to make sure that Aura is safe. From what I understand, we are the shock troops. That makes us at least somewhat disposable. Not from our perspective, of course, but in the greater scheme of things."

Aura reaches out a hand, and touches Marcus's own. She looks up, her bright eyes meeting his directly. "You are not expendable," she says firmly.

Colin grins. "We're the good guys. I'm not sure **we** get expendable shock troops."

Since Aura's pronouncement of conquest, Floyd's veneer of humor is gone. "You know, we really don't have anything in place for this. The government, I mean, and as far as I know, nobody else does either. Not us, not the Soviets... well, Russians, now... not the UN." He shakes his head. "We can't bury this or hide from it. So... I'm in. I'll sell the White House on Captain Tove's plan, one way or the other."

Marcus reaches out to pat Aura's hand. "Colin is right, we are the good guys. Makes me think we should be doing some kind of military training. Preferably in the montage format so I can lose 20 pounds in about ten minutes." He nods to Floyd, "And welcome in! Not sure what it entails yet, but we're all going to find out soon enough, I imagine." He asides to Jason, "Sounds fun, doesn't it?"

Jason grins at Marcus. "Yeah. It's gonna be a helluva ride."

Toby gives an enthusiastic thumbs-up. Tove grins, and turns to his immigrant friend. "Well that leaves you, junk-man. I remember you punching that guy out in one shot at the Lumbley. You've always fought for what you think is right, so your call sign is Scrapper." The Captain turns to the others. "You never pick your own call sign. Someone else does, and you'll often be the last to know. These are code names while you're on duty, so that radio intercepts don't pick up real names."

"So what does an old guy who makes a paper dragon get for a call sign?" asks Marcus. "Fogey Origami? The AARP Avenger?"

Colin blinks, "The pulp?"

Captain Tove rubs the back of his neck, smiling uncertainly. "Please pick something I won't be embarrassed to tell the Air Force about."

"I'll just listen to my grandkids talk about video games and pick something out," decides Marcus. "Preferably not Mario."

"How about 'Papercut'?" Floyd quips, supressing a grin.

Marcus arches an eyebrow and shakes his head. He had intended on a demo, in any case. He opens up his rolling suitcase and taps the paper, gaining control of it the way he's accustomed to. It is clear he's concentrating pretty carefully, weaving ream after ream of paper into a growing form. It stabilizes for a moment, then suddenly shoots up in size, until a dragon about thirty feet long is formed, its wings stretching out over its creator. On its paws are claws as large as swords. "Neat, huh? I bet the grandkids would get a kick out of it. Just like that video game they play. I'm curious, though.. cause I bet these young men can do things even more amazing than this." And from his tone, it's clear he believes it.

Colin jumps back and looks up. "I..." He pauses for a second, "Well, I would like to think so, but I'm not sure I have anythign quite as.. visually impressive to demonstrate..." He mutters, mostly to himself, "Yet."

"I figure we should have callsigns that make sense for what we do," says Marcus. He draws the dragon down to a more reasonable size of fiften feet. "Paper Dragon sounds rather dumb, though, don't you think?"

Floyd takes in the display, in utter shock, but stands his ground. His lips form words in Latin: "Ave Maria, gratia plena..."

Colin says, "Anyway, isn't it usually paper tiger?"

Colin says, "Besides, I don't see why just plain 'Dragon' can't fit, anyway."

Tove laughs. "**You** know what you do. the goal here is to obscure, not to inform. But, I'm not in charge of this."

Colin says, "It seems to describe you and your...." Colin stumbles at a loss for words, ".. pet."

Jason looks impressed. "Now that's a pretty cool dragon. But it doesn't breathe fire." He concentrates, closing his eyes, and the air begins to ripple in front of the dragon's mouth like a heat haze. Then - there is an explosion. Well, more of a firecracker, really - but a small fireball erupts in front of the dragon's mouth, and the sheets of paper that form the dragon's nostrils catch fire. "There, now it breathes fire." He frowns. "...But where's the kaboom? There was supposed to be an earth-shattering kaboom."

Colin raises an eyebrow as Jason demonstrates.

Jason chuckles. "Heh. Y'know, with all three of us going at once, and Marcus feeding sheets through the flame, we _could_ get a fire-breathing dragon. I start the fire, Marcus supplies more fuel, and Colin feeds it."

Toby rubs his hands together. "Well, Jason, you will now be my welder! We must begin construction as soon as possible on the ship."

"Well, you do much more with fire and there'll be a pile of ash," says Marcus, laughing. "This thing is rather flammable. Hm. Dragon? I guess that's better than Old Guy, which is really what I am in this group."

Jason shakes his head. "That's not a very efficient way of making fire," he says to Toby. "I have to react the nitrogen with a half dozen things in the air. Takes a lot of concentration, and you don't get much of a bang - as you saw. You'd be better off with a plain old acetylene torch."

Colin laughs, "Jason's found himself a job.." He looks over at Marcus, "Well, older, but also wiser, slow to action, thoughtful. You know, in contrast to the rest of us."

The junkman shrugs. "Fine. I will teach you to weld, if you don't do a good job I fire you."

Marcus grins at Toby. "He's a fair manager." The words from Colin make him look a little more serious. "Well, I will try to be the level head. That means it falls to you and Jason to follow impulses and take chances. You have to believe in what you are doing, even if it might not always be the wisest thing. My prudence isn't enough to guide us through every challenge, but with the Captain's help it should give us time to gain experience. Once we have that down, your courage and willpower will be the real force our opposition has to deal with."

The group's attention is drawn by the wavering of something nearby - the link compass. They look over. The device is orienting itself unsteadily, but after a few seconds it has managed to point itself firmly in a single direction: southeast, toward New York City.

"Right," says Jason. "Let's get to it. Who's driving?" He doesn't wait for an answer - he's already headed for his own car.
