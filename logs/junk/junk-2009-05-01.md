# Junkyard Heroes 2009-05-01

The link compass is pointing at New York City. Scrapper's got his truck, but Floyd has slightly better transportation: an anonymous van, scrubbed of Federal identification, whose intended purpose was transportation of material and personnel.

With Floyd in the driver's seat, the others help Aura into the back, and she smiles in gratitude. Everyone buckles up, and the van lurches out of the junkyard and off toward the city.

Driving is bearable. Floyd is hearing police chatter over his radio, concerning something going down in Washington Heights - just over the George Washington bridge. While nobody's calling for an evacuation just yet, police units in the vicinity are being asked to keep a lookout for "something", and Floyd hears hints of a robbery that was committed.

Floyd works the radio with one hand and the steering wheel with the other. New York City has an 'alphabet soup' of agencies almost as complex as the federal government - but unlike the feds, they all share a common radio system. Some more chatter may prove enlightening. He weaves in and out of traffic, towards the Deegan Expressway.

"I saw it! I saw it! It's all gold! Went down the drains!" comes an excited voice over the radio. "Say again?" calls out Dispatch. "21 Charlie, 21 Charlie, reporting a sighting of suspect fleeing Villanueva Jewelry, 1265 Saint Nick," comes another voice.

"Gold," muses Marcus. "That should be an interesting start for us."

"Suspect is wearing gold outfit, moving incredibly fast. Got some legs on that guy. We lost visual," call the police.

Colin says, "It plugs straight into a basic human vice...."

"He's using the Link to boost his speed. Pretty clever," comments Jason. "Still, he can only think as fast as anyone else."

Floyd says, "'A committee has six or more legs and no brain,'" Floyd quips. "My brother is always saying that. Anyone got any ideas?"

Jason says, "I do. Floyd, is there a phonebook in here? City map? Let's see if we can find the nearest jewelry store and stake him out."

More traffic comes over the radio - it sounds like the dispatcher. "Silent alarm triggered, 1284 Saint Nicholas. 21 Charlie, 23 Charlie, please investigate. Amoros Jewelry."

"Son of a bitch is working his way uptown on Saint Nick." Floyd slews the van onto an off ramp. "Map is in the glove box. We'll head south until we run into him."

Floyd slows reluctantly as they near the bottom of the ramp and turns right. "West 155th. I hope that was right? Where do we go from here?"

"Follow Broadway north, around 10 blocks," says Marcus. He is curious about what is going on, but not nervous. "Where it turns into Saint Nicholas Avenue," he adds, almost as an after thought.

Jason turns to Aura. "I don't know much about how you relate to the Links. Can you sense anything when we're close? Or do you have to touch them, or what?"

"Distance doesn't matter," answers Aura with a sad smile. "Once you find this poor soul, I can help him."

As Floyd drives north and signals for his lane changes, Jason thumbs through a dirty, oil-stained copy of the Yellow Pages as quickly as possible. He finds about half a dozen jewelry stores and pawn shops up and down this stretch of the street.

"Okay, let's keep our eyes peeled," says Jason. "Saint Nick might as well _be_ the Jewelry District, so he could turn up anywhere." He pauses. "What're we gonna do when we find him? Just tell him to stop in the name of the Link?"

Colin glances up. "Maybe ask him to stop?"

The van pulls up at the original store they recall hearing; already they can hear police sirens. It's been quiet, but now one unit calls in. "21 Charlie to Dispatch. Suspect is.. covered in some sort of gold outfit. Very strange looking. Subject is armed with knives or swords of some kind. The last place he hit, the proprietor said it was like an insect came in and.. ate his stuff. Dispatch, requesting 5 King lift off, he's too fast for us on foot."

"I have a strong suspicion that this one isn't going to just fold for us," says Marcus. "These actions aren't consistent with a cooperative attitude. We may be able to do this without a fight, but we need to prepare for the worst."

Jason hands Marcus the phone book. "Agreed," he says, winking at the older man.

"The NYPD just called in their air circus," Floyd mutters. He stomps the accelerator and withdraws his own phone. "That won't do at all."

A golden blur streaks past the van. The police sirens start up again, blaringly loud now that they're so close. The group can see a pair of black-and-whites driving up the street in their direction as well.

Marcus accepts the book and lets out an almost relaxed sigh. "Floyd, are we okay to go airbourne, or are we aiming for some manner of secrecy?" The blur makes him raise his eyebrows, "This one is not going to be easy.."

It's the measure of Floyd's experience that he doesn't startle easy, even when a giant golden insect passes him at highway speeds... but there's worry in his eyes. "Do it," he barks. "Whatever it is."

"Hell with secrecy!" shouts Jason. He hurls open the van's door and jumps out, heading in the direction of the golden blur. Inspired by the felon's insight, he summons a tailwind for himself.

The golden shape disappears into another building, and the police cars converge on it with squealing brakes. Three cops pile out of the cruisers, while one stays behind to radio in the situation; Floyd can hear him starting to make his report.

Floyd dials. "I'm going to get the FAA to re-route all air traffic, including the NYPD's. Marcus, if you want to invite your friend out to play..." The van screeches to a stop by a recycling dumpster, overflowing with paper and cardboard. "Let 'er rip!"

"Alrighty, let's start, then," says Marcus. He turns his attention to the reams of paper that were brought along and dives right in. Seeing Jason rush off makes him grin, but he doesn't pursue just yet. Instead, he works carefully at weaving all that paper into a quickly enlarging dragon.

Colin steps out of the van, and pulls his peace knot off of his sword. He looks at the police rushing by, the secret agent in the van, and the team of heros. "Right out of Cutey Honey." He looks down, "With more clothes..."

Colin runs after Jason. But at his normal speed.

For the moment, Floyd is running the switchboard. While his phone is ringing, he broadcasts back to the NYPD, asserting his name, rank, and don't-screw-with-me number over New Yawk's Finest. He sees the uniforms on the sidewalk, barely a hundred feet away, stop and start griping, not yet noticing the team of unlikely heros converging on their position.

As Jason comes round the edge of the door to the latest jewelry shop being hit, he has time to hear the cops yelling at him. And inside, he catches sight of a human-sized... bug. It looks like a scarab beetle made out of solid gold, with six limbs, and it's literally ingesting jewelry from the shop's broken racks.

"Hold it, gold bug!" yells Jason, raising his hands. He concentrates - and the nitrogen around the beetle mimics his movements, turning into an invisible but quite tangible pair of hands that attempts to grab onto the shell.

Marcus isn't sure how Jason fares inside the store, but he's not going to sluff off and waste time getting in there to back him up. He reaches up with boths hands, plucked easily off the ground and carried towards the jewelry store by the massive paper dragon.

All around the street the usually unflappable people of New York either run in panic or stare slack-jawed at the spectacle. Still, there are some who don't even notice. A rather bored woman walks down the street with a newspaper in one hand and a little boy holding the other. The child exclaims in delight, "Mommy, dragon! Dragon mommy!" The woman just nods and mutters, "That's wonderful, dear," paying not the least mind.

The extraordinary strength of the gold bug is evident. It smashes out of its aerial imprisonment, and scuttles toward Jason.

Colin jogs along side with Floyd as the unlikely duo make their way to the jewelry shop.

The police officers are unholstering their weapons, too surprised to do much else except stare at the creature inside.

Marcus finally catches sight of exactly what he's up against and goes into defensive thinking right away. "Glad you're still barking, friend! The cavalry has arrived!" he says to Jason.

"Shit!" cries Jason, and backpedals. The low ceiling makes it hard for him to get too far out of reach, but nevertheless, as Jason retreats, he steps on the air which becomes solid for him. As does a shell of air surrounding him - those solid gold arms look like they'd _hurt_ if they slashed at him.

Marcus first move is to protect himself and Jason. The papers he bears spring into action, racing out to form a protective wall. "I take it our diplomacy has failed," he calls out.

Jason is relieved as the paper wall forms itself, but he's still careful enough to duck under a gold dart that whistles from the creature's mouth at him.

Floyd pulls out his badge and holds it high. "FBI!" he shouts. "Federal investigation! Fall back and take cover!"

Colin jogs the rest of the way too the scene, kind of late to the party. He looks at what they've gotten into. "This seems to be fun." He smirks.

The cops back off, nodding obligingly. "5 King's in the air!" one shouts at Floyd.

"That's the end of the line, mister!" He points at the gleaming monstrosity again. If there is indeed a person under all that, he needs to breathe - and he may find that hard with nitrogen pressing around his head and crowding out his air. "Hey you!" he calls, as Colin rushes up. "Give me a hand!"

The gold bug spits out a hail of golden darts, showering its assailants - but fortunately for them, paper and air are enough to fully brunt the attacks.

Floyd gets a glimpse of the brawl going on inside the jewelry store... a giant bug, spitting spikes. "Call a riot unit," he barks. "What's King 5?"

With the enemy in range, the paper dragon is able to attack, and it makes the most of it. The tail of the great dragon whips forward with a scream through the air, tearing into the golden insect.

"Just an observer!" calls back one of the cops. The officer in the car is coming forward, toting a shotgun.

Colin rushes up infront of the others under attack.. Drawing his weapon, he closes to striking range of the.. bug.

Jason focuses on the creature, intent on forcing as much of the oxygen away as he can - grimacing as the creature manages to move fast enough to get out of the anoxic bubble. "Damn you..." he mutters under his breath, beginning to sweat.

Marcus knows his business well enough. He's not equipped to take down the enemy with a direct attack. He will stay focused on keeping his allies up and kicking to bring this target down.

Golden scales flutter and flap from the creature's body, and for the first time Jason hears a gasping noise - but not from its mouth. It breathes, but not in the way a man would. What happened here? It concentrates all of its energy on attacking the two sources of annoyance: Jason, and the dragon.

A dozen more golden spears are spit out, but the paper barrier turns everything aside.

The paper dragon lashes out once more with its tail, but this time the enemy is simply too fast, avoiding the attack entirely.

The crash of the golden spears against the paper barrier is unbelievably loud. Floyd winces. "Hey, is that a Benelli?" Before the officer can react, Floyd's swapped his Beretta for the police shotgun. _Remington. Oh well._ He cycles a round into the chamber and runs towards the fight.

Colin swings at the bug, his sword dancing around the many arms, but ultimately it bounces off the golden frame of the bug.

"Patience," is Marcus' only advice. "Can we get some fire laid down?" he asks calmly. The shield is his focus, and he will continue to shield his allies.

The bug has had enough. Retreating from the aerial assault, Colin's sword, and the dragon's tail, the creature darts for a back door.

Jason struggles to keep the pocket of nitrogen around the bug, but it's too fast. "Come back here you..." he growls. "What the hell's up with your _breathing_? Colin!" he yells. "Where's his oxygen?"

Floyd, with little knowledge of insects or metallurgy, falls back on the modern man's cheapest superpower: twenty years of training with shotguns. He draws a bead on whatever part of the metal bug looks vulnerable.

Colin runs after the bug, his Katana dropped to one hand, as he beats feet in pursuit.

As the bug scuttles away, Jason jogs across the air in pursuit. "Come back here!" he yells, concentrating again. This time, he _knows_ he kept the bubble on him... he's sure of it...

The gold bug rears back, intent on sending fatal spikes through Colin and Jason. But as Jason's focus takes hold again, it makes a raspy noise that sounds like untuned violins and collapses to the floor of the shop.

Jason's feet rattle on the floor as he lets himself drop out of the air. "Marcus! Wrap him up good! But try to leave him some air holes... wherever he left them. I dunno how long he'll be out."

As soon as the bug hits the dirt Marcus rushes up, his paper spinning out and engulfing the bug like a spider's web. "Fitting way to capture an insect." He does his best to not kill the target, but he's just guessing. "We'll have to drag him out of here, too."

Scrapper isn't far behind. He's wheeling Aura forward in her wheelchair, wrapped under a heavy comforter.

Floyd slings the shotgun. "Good timing. He's in there." He motions to the paper cocoon, and goes outside to keep the police clear of the Unexplained Phenomena.

As the metal angel is wheeled inside, she lets out a soft sigh. She guides Scrapper to push her forward next to the bug, as it heaves and rattles within its confines. She leans forward and reaches out a hand. And as she does, wings of light sprout from her back, engulfing the entire jewelry shop in a blinding radiance.

"Come back to us, friend," she whispers to the bug, and strokes what passes for its head. The gold of its skin slides from its body onto her flesh, slowly transmuting Aura from a burnished metallic hue to that of a golden statue. What's left of the creature begins to shift.

It isn't shrinking so much as _sliding_ somehow. There's a distinct sensation of movement as the others watch, although it isn't changing position on the floor. What's left is a naked man, with sweaty hair. He's short, scrawny, and pale.

Colin kneels down, and checks the man, to see if he's still alive, breathing, or what have you. "Is there anything we can cover him with?"

Jason glances at Marcus. "I think we can come up with something."

"Wow," breathes Marcus. "Aura, that was.. what was that?" He turns his attention to the man on the floor. "I suppose he's under arrest, right?" He reaches out to set a hand on Jason's shoulder, "Fine work there, young man. That was some excellent use of your gifts."

The wings collapse into nothingness, and Aura sits back in her chair. "It is done," she says with a smile.

Jason grins at Marcus. "You did pretty good yourself. Those darts of his were hitting pretty hard."

Floyd saunters back inside. His apparently gave the shotgun back to the police, and has his handgun out. "I don't think they believed me when I told them that this was all routine, but nobody saw anything conclusive, so I asked them - ok, ordered - to go check out the other robbery sites. The FBI is on the way to help us sweep this under the rug." He kneels next to the naked, unconscious man. "Victim of his own greed, right? I bet he worked at one of these jewelry stores. Probably the first one." He stands up and holsters his weapon. "Sounds like he was kidnapped by a monster from his own id. You don't arrest kidnap victims."

Marcus nods, "I'm going to have to practice. I need to be strong enough to leave you and Colin free to attack. Colin, how is he?" Marcus will look around for a scrap of clothing, then stops and rolls his eyes at himself. "Duh." With a simple exercise power he's working the paper about the man.

"Can you give him some extra air?" Jason asks Colin. "I don't envy him the headache he's gonna have."

Jason looks at the man and adds under his breath, "But until then, sleep well and dream of gold women."

Colin nods to Jason, and uses his gift to make sure that he is actually getting some oxygen. He pulls one of the skirts off the table in teh jewelry store, and at least covers the poor man.

Floyd walks back to the entrance, smiles, and waves to confused passerby. "He was eating gold. He got a lot bigger. Where did all the extra weight go?"

"We'll have to debrief later and talk about what we've learned from this episode," decides Marcus. "I know I need to work on indoor effectiveness at some point." He grins suddenly, "And Colin, I gotta say.. charging the thing? That took some serious brass."

A few agents from the FBI field office arrive and help Floyd co-ordinate the information coming in from the NYPD. The linked man is Joseph Goldberg, who earned the unflattering nickname Goldbug. The name turned out to be providential; Goldberg remembers little of what happened after he got his link. Floyd officially writes Goldberg up as someone kidnapped by unidentified thieves, and makes a plausible but bogus link to other unsolved gold thefts. Unofficially, Aura explains the truth. "He was compelled to consume his element at any cost," she says. "It came to him, and he was not ready."

By the end of the day, it's a case for insurance adjusters. New York has had strings of robberies before. Thanks to Scrapper and his allies, it didn't have to be any worse than that.
