# Junkyard Heroes 2009-06-12

With things more or less under control, Marcus turns his attention to his friends. "So, what kinda range do you think our target gets on that transmission? If he's going through the trouble, and he's not here, it would seems logical that he's listening. Further, he-or she, I suppose-now knows we are here. Ostensibly."

Colin shrugs, "Well, unless he's very sophisticated, he needs to be in the general vicinity to change the broadcast." He hmms, "Maybe if we made a device to block the broadcast, he couldn't control the bugs as easily?"

"That's something I didn't think of," murmurs Marcus. "I wonder if that's possible to remotely do that manner of thing." He nods to Colin, "Hopefully we can experiment with that. For now, knowing the limits of that transmission might just help us find the link we're looking for. And maybe we can track that thing that hit us earlier."

"The transmission changed when we showed up," Floyd mentions. "And a rig like this, in VHF, could have a range of ten to fifty miles. I want to have a look. Aura, can you keep the coal-bugs off our back for a few minutes? Long enough for me to search the shack?"

The golden woman bobs her head - gracefully, despite the peculiar fact of her seeming metallic composition. "Please bring them near to me, and I will do what I can," she promises.

"I will keep you protected," says Marcus. "Be careful in that shack. I'm not sure who we are dealing with, but this time they seem a lot more prepared."

Floyd taps Tove. "Set us down but keep the engine hot. I need, say, fifteen minutes." To the others, he says, "I'm the cop. I need to go. Jason, you seem like you'd be good at forensics. You don't have to come but it would make me feel better."

Tove parks the big helicopter outside the shack. It's a tight fit, but he's good at his job. The rotors slow and the engines get quieter, but do not stop. Floyd wastes no time, covering the short stretch of open ground to the open shack quickly.

The owner of the shack, by the look of it, is an author - a man named Francis or Frank Shelby - and published in Appalachian newspapers and magazines from the clippings. None of the group have heard of him. He has licenses to operate a ham radio set, fly propeller-driven aircraft, and half a dozen other odd occupations.

The most significant discover is what isn't here. There's no remote control rigs, no gimmicks, no sensors, no home automation, no traps. The radio set isn't even tuned to the frequency on which the numbers station is broadcasting, but provably it's still sending out a signal. There's no evidence that the shack was put in order for an extended departure; signs are everywhere that Shelby left in a hurry.

Throughout the examination, Jason can definitely feel a presence lurking nearby.

"He's... his aura is here," says Jason. "I don't know how else to describe it." He peers at the radio set. "If the numbers station changed when we arrive, he _must_ have something he's Linking to here..."

Marcus calls out to his friends inside, "Let's cover the few facts we have so far. This guy can control coal. That's carbon, right? And from what you say, this tower is alive without any indication of why. Sudden departure evident, too. The numbers station changed when we arrived. Is that all we have?"

"This guy is a pro. He had time to tidy up," Floyd says, "but he still left in a hurry. That means that something came up. He went somewhere." He jots down the frequency on the transmitter. "A pilot and a ham. Two vocations that know how to keep a logbook. If he had time to tidy up, he would have written what he was up to."

Colin perks, and yells down at Floyd, "Are there any aircraft registrations down there? Maybe we can look up call numbers, find out is the plane is still there?"

Floyd looks around quickly, seeking a logbook - either of the aviator's or the radioman's type.

"Can carbon somehow generate a signal?" calls out Marcus.

While Floyd looks, Jason uses his affinity to his linked element, sensing out the radio and its component parts. The radio itself feels fine - normal, given the electronic components he expects to find. But there's a build-up of something he can feel in the connections from the radio to its tower. Physically there's nothing he can see in the cables. But if he were to describe the sensation, it'd be as if someone somehow tapped into the output.

Outside, Aura is sitting comfortably, surrounded by small piles of dirt and coal and rocky lumps, a pitying smile on her face. "I think someone is here," she calls in through the door.

"Damndest thing," Jason says, shaking his head. "I don't know _how_ he does it, but he's got _something_ Linked to the cable outputs. That's probably how he's changing the signal from a distance..." Overhearing Aura's announcement, he ventures outside.

"You think like the last one, he's essentially become the element?" asks Marcus.

"He's here alright," Floyd mutters. "So how do we cure him?" He knows Aura won't hear him; but his cop instincts still tell him, figure out where the guy went, and he'll know why.

Colin looks at Aura, "I think if we're not careful, Aura's going to becomime his element, too...."

Colin looks down at Aura again. "Can you tell where you think the person is? I get the same feeling, but.. I can't tell where... except.. around..."

Aura sighs quietly. "I still don't have the ability to locate people by direction, Colin," she explains. "I'm sorry I can't be more use to you."

"I don't know if his _body's_ here at all," says Jason. "How far can a Link's influence reach, anyway?" he asks Aura.

The woman hums. "Distance isn't... really relevant," she says at last. "What you want to think of as space and distance and such don't really enter into it. The range could be considerable."

Floyd finds the most recent radio logbook, and unfortunately, there's nothing enlightening. Nothing so direct as 'Going to check out meteorite, back in an hour.' _Oh, well. The Gold Bug didn't even have to the leave his house to be affected._ He puts the book back and heads outside. "Aura, can you cure him, like you did the Goldberg?"

"So theoretically, he could be anywhere. To within the accuracy of our Link compasses, at least," says Jason. "Just because we can feel his Link doesn't mean he's anywhere close. Just that he's... able to find his Link target out here."

Aura nods. "I should be able to. If we can find him."

Colin calls down to the ground, "Hey Floyd. Do you think we could get some of the local fuzz to track the spider things?"

"So he's 'here'," Floyd says, "but he's not really here. Okay. We know he went somewhere from here. So yeah." Floyd grinds his teeth. The thought of reading in the local cops on the matter upsets him. He exits the shack and shuts the door. "Let's go get help. I need some coffee."

Floyd takes a detour on the way to the helicopter, to have a look at the antenna. "If he's tapped into it, and he's living in the ground..." he says, thinking aloud.

"That's all speculation," Marcus points-out. "Just playing devil's advocate. From the sound of things, he could be a long ways off. Our best bet now is to track the spiders and see what happens, right?"

Floyd straightens and climbs back aboard. "In that case, maybe the transmission we're hearing is the spiders 'phoning home'."

Tove tries the radio a few times, while Toby helps Aura back into the helicopter. After some attempts, the Air Force man shrugs. "I think they're asleep," he reports. "I couldn't raise 24-hour dispatch, they might not even have it out here."

The chopper lifts off, flying a little short of 50 miles south. It touches down at Yeager, near Charleston, WV. There's cots and coffee, and Uncle Sam will pick up the tip.

---

Morning comes. Tove reports to Floyd after a few more minutes. "I tried the pay phone here and the radio. Nobody's answering the police number in Ripley. I'm frankly a little concerned."

Colin perks up, assuming he's around to hear this. "We should probably go back. After briefly checking to see if this is normal."

"We'll check on the way," Floyd says. "I've got a bad feeling about this."

"Looks like the tracking job isn't our top priority anymore," says Marcus. "Let's get back up there and make sure those people are safe."

The Pave Hawk leaves the familiar and welcome ground of an airport to wander it's way back into what most people would classify as the less civilized. The trip is relatively uneventfun. Colin looks out the window, his fingers stroking along his long scabbard idly as he does, lost in thought. Aura and Scrapper are silent in back. By request, the Police parking lot has been cleared out in order to accomidate the black bird, and one again showing his skill, touches the bird down on the pavement.

"I got somebody on the radio," announces Tove at last. He takes a few moments to hold conversation. "A hunter, about 20 miles north. He's camping out and brought his CB along - nothing from town."

The town is deserted, even at this hour. Streets are empty. Lights are off.

"This looks quite bad," says Marcus. "You picking up anything with that weird feeling you sometimes get, gentlemen?"

Colin looks at Tove. "Is this not talking silent? Are the radio stations coming in at all?"

Cars are parked on the streets. Windows aren't broken. There's no sign of panic or riot; it's simply that people aren't _here_. Shop signs have power, but nobody's turned on the lights inside.

Floyd approaches the front door of the police station and knocks heavily. "There's a radio station down the street. Is it transmitting?"

Tove listens in. "Nope. Nobody. Except, you know who..."

Colin says, "Tove, can you contact the Tracker and let him know to stay put, and we'll come find him?"

The Captain gets on the radio, relaying the request. "He says he'll stand by," is the word.

Colin points to one of the jeeps in the parking lot, "Surely they leave the keys in these...."

Floyd grins. "Ignition coils... they have a lot of iron in them, don't they?"

After a bit of fiddling, Scrapper's able to hotwire a pickup, and proudly sticks his hand out at the vehicle. "Our new chariot, comrades."

Floyd nods. "Okay. Tove, Aura, and Scrapper in the Pave Hawk, for when it hits the fan. Everyone else, let's go hunting."

Colin gets in the back of the pickup.. Taking his large impliment of death with him. Hey, there's no people to spook here anymore, right?

The truck revs its engine and starts out of town. At the road out, however, the brakes squeal and it comes to a stop - to avoid running over the man who suddenly ran out onto the street, having hidden under an SUV.

He looks disheveled and terrified, and is dressed in the garb of a priest. He's panting and wide-eyed.

Colin scoots over in the back of the pickp, and looks the man over. "Get in, Father. Tell us what youve seen..."

The man is trembling. "Drive! DRIVE!" he yells hysterically. "The Devil! It's upon us!"

As Colin helps him in, the stink of brimstone is evident on his clothes. He's also bleeding from one arm, but he's managed to bandage that fairly well.

Colin is caught momentarily speechless as the man exclaims. He turns to Floyd, "Back to the Pave Hawk first?" He turns to the new crew member, "What have you been through, Father?"

"Satan has come to claim us," the man announces matter-of-factly. "He came from the ground. His minions, the army of Beelzebub, came for me! I saw her.. Susan... dragged into the ground..." He clasps his hands to his face, and begins weeping.

"So that's where everyone went," mutters Marcus darkly.

"Okay, this is getting serious," Jason says grimly, as he grips the wheel of the Jeep and sends it hurtling back down the road in a shower of gravel. "I think the time for skulking and hunting is done."

Floyd shakes his head. "Keep going. This is getting urgent." Then, to the priest, "Is there anybody else? In the church, maybe?"

Colin closes his eyes and concentrates, this time his concentration is under the ground, he knows what people's respiration looks like, from an oxygen point fo view. He's seeking out signs of this feeling... below them.

"I.. I don't think so..." The priest clutches his bandaged arm. "No, no, they're all gone," he says at last.

Colin looks over to the Pastor, and looks at his arm. "THen, I think you should help us go find your lost flock, yes?"

The man looks at Colin as though he were crazy. Where else would he go, after all.

Floyd gets on the radio to Tove. "Captain, this is getting serious. The... uh... suspect... he apparently dragged the locals underground. We can only hope that it's reversible." Then, to the priest, "Reverend, you believe there's a Devil. I don't, not like this anyway. But if it is the Devil, we've got the right Angel with us." He does his best to sound convincing.

Before Jason drives too much farther, Marcus excuses himself from the vehicle. He takes a radio, "I'm going to scout this place out and try to pick up any other survivors, and maybe catch sight of our elusive trouble maker. When you pick up our tracker, let me know. I will keep in touch, every two minutes or less. If you need the thunder, call me."

With the paper master dropped off, Jason drives on into the woods, trying to stick to roads, or at least well packed dirt, as much as possible. "Well, this is the place," he says eventually, bringing the Jeep to a halt.

Colin looks at the Father, "You got a name, Father?" He smiles, waits for the mans answer, then jumps out of the pickup. "Hello?"

"Fa- father Coughlin," the man says.

The hunter, named Bob Salzman, brought an ATV on his trip. Consequently he's at the road when the vehicle pulls up. "Whassamatter?" he calls, then spots the man of the cloth. "Father, y'okay? Guys, what's goin' on here?"

Colin looks at the hunter. "We can fill you in on the way, but it seems that some devilry has hit the town, and we're trying to track it down. I assume you're our man to do that?"

Salzman appraises the group and chuckles slyly. "Y'all don't seem the woodcrafty sort, so I guess I am," he answers.

---

Salzman knows his business. He finds the tracks left behind on the road outside of Ripley. The group hunt their way through the woods, following the traces. They arrive at a large, odd-looking hole in the ground, sloped steeply down into the bowels of the earth, and the stench of sulfur is heavy.

"Sulfuric acid," comments Jason. "If this guy's Link is coal, he's got really exquisite control over it. I guess the coal around here is high sulfur."

Floyd pokes the dirt with his shoe. "He dug a hole with it. If we get doused in it we're going to be very, very dead."

Colin looks back to floid, "Most carbon rings include oxygen and or nitrogent, right? We should be.. fairly safe." He himself sounds unsure.

Floyd looks confused. "I'm a cop, Colin. English, please."

Colin feels ahead of himself, followed by the others. The tunnels are large and odorous, and the group eventually resort to wrapping their faces in parts of their clothes. They emerge into a cavern, and behold a sight out of someone's Hell.

Bodies are here, hundreds of them, all stacked like cordwood. The oxygen here is faint and pitiful; Colin's doing his best to concentrate it around the group. The people of the town are here, and they don't seem to be breathing. But they aren't dead either - rather, they're in a sort of suspended animation. Sulfur spiders are skittering throughout the tunnel, poking at the bodies, spitting out sulfuric acid in an effort to dig new tunnels.

Tove is on the way with Scrapper and Aura, and Marcus is coming as well.

"What the hell does he _want_ with them?" wonders Jason, bewildered. "Hell with it. We need to get these people out of here." He strides straight for the nearest body.

The spiders perk up, and as a group they wheel to face Jason and the others.

Floyd reaches and pulls Jason back. "We're only breathing because Colin can concentrate. This isn't a time for half-assed."

Colin will simply take his sword out of it's sheath, discardign the scabbard somewher nearby. He tries to detect whereelse the oxygen might be flowing. POssibly around our mark?

Jason rears back. "Right. You little twerps are gonna get in our way, are you? Shoo!" He concentrates - though the air is stifling, there is still plenty of gaseous nitrogen - and attempts to sweep the spiders away.

Colin looks over at Jason, "Step back.. maybe they'll jsut ignore us-" He's intrrupted as Jason speaks. So much for that idea.

Seeing what it's come to, Floyd readies Maurer's grapple beam and begins praying in Latin. "Ave Maria, Gratia Plena..."

Colin will step over to Jason's location, sword at the ready, to fight these things off.

Two spiders get through - one for Jason, and one for Colin, both leaping on their respective parties. Colin loses his sword, while Jason loses his balance and falls over.

**WHO DARES!**

The voice shakes the cavern, and Floyd sees a pair of brightly burning eyes open on the far wall - followed by six more such eyes. They are literally pits of flame, flickering in the cavern, and the ground beneath the explorers' group cracks open.

A gigantic column of earth, stone and coal bursts upward from below, and pierces the ceiling above. **DO NOT PRAY HERE, LITTLE MAN,** warns the voice.

---

Near town, a small hillock bursts open. Marcus and his dragon spot it easily from the air. A worm - a worm beyond all imagining - has sprouted itself from the ground and now flails its way upward. Spotting the paper dragon, it lunges out with its body, trying to strike at it.

The first strike is moments too late to be a surprise. The dragon has its own armor, and Marcus' shield adds to it. The response is swift and terrible. Talons like swords sweep out at the enemy, shredding its earthen flesh.

But the worm is fast, large beyond management. "Clash of the Titans," whispers Marcus softly. The only saving grace is that the worm is not the most agile of things, though it is fast. So fast and so strong that occasionally Marcus' shield is simply not enough. Still, the dragon does not miss easily, by tail and by claw it wears down the enemy, turning its flesh to dust with blows that would crush a car.

The paper master grins suddenly, realizing that at the current rate, there's no way he's going to win. "Time for plan B!" The dragon's body opens for a moment, long enough to let the man break out. The dragon continues its battle, and the worm, for all its power, is limited in focus. Marcus slips close and opens his case of paper. Noticing a tractor left nearby, plan B is suddenly much more clear. With his left hand he opens the gas cap of the vehicle and with his right he controls the paper, which dives in. Thus soaked, it is cast at the enemy.

"And he will cast them into the lake of fire," whispers Marcus. A flick of a lighter is lost in the noise of the battle, but when that little flame catches hold of the gas-soaked paper, the worm finds itself transformed into a blazing totem in moments.

---

Colin concentrates as the ball of fire enters the chamber. He looks quickly over to Jason, who should be taking care of his end of things, but he works to pull as much oxygen as possible from the flaming worm. He stares it down, and watches the orange and crimson flames die down before him, deprived of one source of fuel.

The coal-spiders are tiny, compared to the weight that the beam was designed to lift. Floyd has little trouble plucking them off the floor and hurling them bodily across the chamber. He stays clear of the burning column. _Okay. Think fast. Talk the crazy man off his ledge._ "This isn't Hell, and you aren't the Devil! Where's Shelby?"

"Leave the spiders to Floyd!" calls Jason, shaking free of the rubble from the last one as he wraps nitrogen around the inferno, forcing it into the gaps left by the oxygen sucked away by Colin. Even as he does so, he uses another little trick - slowing the motion of the nitrogen molecules, to suppress the raging heat from the flames, protecting himself and his companions from heatstroke.

In the helicopter, Aura has asked Captain Tove for a strange request: put her directly over the hole and the burning worm. Marcus has the best vantage point on what happens next.

The woman jumps out of the helicopter and plummets directly toward the flames. Bright wings of light emerge from her back, supporting her and slowing her descent. And she reaches down.

As her hand touches the mass of the sulfur worm, it begins to collapse away. Chunks of rock fall to earth around her, driven away from the central core of the worm. A soft glow around her hand becomes a brilliant flame of purification. And within the cavern, the tunnel explorers see Aura descend slowly toward them. All around her, the fire still burns, but she is unharmed.

"The link is being purified," she announces. "I think... please, can one of you carry me to the cabin?"

"Sweet mother of mercy," breathes Marcus.

Floyd offers his shoulder. "This one, on the other hand, is really an angel." For her metallic countenance, she seems no heavier than another human.

Colin perks up, "I think we'd better go check that out. Good job there, but the way, Jason..." He runs, pickign up his sowrd and scababrd to the outside, to witness the distruction.

The groups reunite on the surface, and Marcus transports everyone directly to the cabin in the interest of time. Once there, Aura is carried inside. "I'm so sorry I didn't see you before," she says to the air, and reaches out. And from nothingness she begins pulling a human figure: a haggard fellow that the others recognize instantly as Shelby. He promptly collapses.

Floyd gapes. "I suppose there's a scientific explanation for where he was," he says flatly.

Colin says, "Of course. Scientific explanations seem to be the order of the day, right? We should probably get everyone out of that cave...."

"He's... the same place Goldberg was," says Jason. "Out of phase, or something. But I wasn't expecting him to be completely disembodied."

Colin, for his part, does turn to start hauling bodies out.

Shelby is showing signs of starvation and thirst. Whatever happened to him, it's clear that he hasn't been able to eat or drink since it did.

"Is he still Linked?" Floyd asks.

Marcus is no doctor, but he will do what he can to help stabilize the man. "What he really needs is about a gallon of water and a meal that is easy on the gut," says Marcus. "And I imagine his link is going to go away if it hasn't already. Right?"

"He is unlinked," reports Aura. "This is very curious. Part of him was left behind, and part went along with the link. I shall want to ask him about his experiences."

"Let's get him to whatever passes for a hospital here," Floyd says. "Get a saline IV going Talk to him all you want, the town is empty. The rest of us need to go back to Hell. Get the rest of the town out of there, and into the fresh air."

"I take it I can't use the big guy to help move people, so I'll get the clinic on its feet," says Marcus. "I remember a thing or two.. hopefully you can find us a doctor and nurse pretty soon, though. My stitch work is rather rusty."

---

The townsfolk are still unconscious. Some sort of obscure biochemical change has taken over their bodies, and Aura positively identifies it: "they are hibernating. They are.. somehow related to the link, I think. But this is hibernation. I can pull them out of it." And so she sets to work at the local gymnasium, where people have been stored.

Shelby tells his story as soon as he's conscious. With Floyd and the others in tow, he relates what happened.

"I came here to get away from it all. I like the wilderness, and the country here is beautiful. But for.. various reasons, I guess some people didn't appreciate that I was an atheist. A few fellows came around the cabin one night. They were telling me how I was going to hell. One of them shoved me. I said.. I said.. 'I'll send you to hell,' or something like that, I don't remember."

"And I... I think I did. I was so angry at these yokels, I was just blind. I .. I think I lost control. I felt terribly guilty about whatever it was I did, but I know that I.. I took them somewhere. Took them to some place to show them what hell was like. And you know what? When I did it, I knew what they were thinking. Knew about the entire town. So... I guess... I guess I took them too."

"I felt just awful. I called out for help, tried to get someone to help me, someone who could listen. But it was like I was dead, a ghost. I couldn't do anything."

Colin watches the man as he tells his story.. He stares, impssively. Of course, Colin doesn't know what it's like to experence sucha thing. The message leaves his stoic, however, and really wishign he could have a trink.

Jason scratches his head. "That... that does explain a lot," he says finally. "Though... not everything. I still don't understand what was happening with the radio, for example."

"I tried calling on the radio for help," Shelby asks hopefully. "Did you get the message after all? I couldn't touch it, but I tried.. I tried everything I could. I wanted someone to hear and find out what'd happened."

"We got a message, all right. But it was just a sequence of numbers. A numbers station," Jason says. "I'm sorry. If we'd been able to crack the code, we might have understood you."

Floyd has years of playing the Man In Black. Outwardly he stoically records the statement in his notebook. Inwardly, he's somewhat more shaken, still seeing the pillar with the eyes. "We heard you. We came. And we're all very lucky that everyone gets to go home when it's done." Floyd folds the notebook and puts it aside. "So tell me, Mister Shelby. What do you think this town has learned? Yourself included."

"I think... I think if that connection was not just between me and them, I think the town has learned everything," Shelby says after a moment. "You see.. I wanted to show them all.. show them how wrong they were. To.. to make them all _understand_. Do you think that it really happened?"

Colin looks at Shelby, "I think that, perhaps, it has not happened." He thinks back to his conversation with the preacher. "Perhaps a demonstration of hell simply servers to solicify the idea of heaven?" He shrugs after this statemetn.

"I think you've all been given an opportunity to understand what it means to condemn someone to Hell," Floyd says. "Perhaps they won't do it so lightly now. Nor you, either. I saw your home. You've accomplished much and have reason to be proud." He allows himself to warm to his role. "But here we've learned that there are strange things in heaven and earth, and even the very wise can cause a tragedy with a careless word, and I think that's a humbling thought no matter what you believe. Wouldn't you agree?"

Shelby nods slowly.

The townsfolk are being brought around. But they behave in a very strange, very singular fashion. Several of the men (and a few of the women) have gotten up, and surrounded the beds on which their fellows rest. They say nothing, not to each other, nor to any other. But as several men are brought up, the civilians restrain them while they're handcuffed. And still no explanation is offered.

Others rise from their beds, covering their faces and bawling loudly or sniffling softly. Some look with obvious contempt at their fellows. A few rise with intent to brawl, only to be restrained by almost prescient neighbors.

Aura approaches the group, wheeling herself in her wheelchair from the helicopter. "Their minds were linked," she explains to the group. "All of them. Together."

"How is such a thing possible?" asks Marcus.

"'Hell is other people'," quotes the Captain to himself.

"Aura..." says Jason, slowly. "Is... is this something the Links were designed to do? Or is it just a side effect of the way they interact with human minds?"

Aura shakes her head. "The link normally terminates in one brain - your own. I think he willed it to extend to his victims as well," she says thoughtfully.

"But I thought the link was gone," notes Marcus. "So why is this particular effect still present? And how can they even operate now? Anyone who comes here will suggest they all get put in some kind of institution."

"They.. still remember what was shared during the link," Aura says quietly.

Jason cringes. "I... don't know if I'd be comfortable with other people knowing that much about me. Even if I knew about them in return."

"So this is just a memory?" asks Marcus. "And not like.. psychic communication? Or whatever."

Colin says, "Almost assuredly things that, when surfaced, are going to create conflict."

Nearby, one of the townsfolk is getting himself settled into a chair, with a sandwich in one hand and a shoe in the other. He bangs it against his knee, without words. The others approach; one prompts him: "Judge?". The judge nods, seeing the half-dozen men brought before him. "Guilty. Life," he announces laconically, and slaps the shoe again. The prisoners' escort nod grimly.

"Confession can be a bitch, too," observes Marcus. "Reminds me of that old Chinese curse.. the last line, anyway. May you always get what you deserve."

Colin looks over the courtroom scene. "A perfect trial.. One withought law enforcement or jedges..." He scoffs, but says this low enough that people outside his immediate vicinity have reasonable doubt as to what he said.

Floyd stands. "Justice is being done. If we'd figured this out last night, they wouldn't be going through this now. So is this better or worse?" He shakes his head. "I don't know. I think we should stick around a few days, though, and tell people what happened. A bullshit UFO cover-up is one thing. This is something else."

Colin shakes his head, and puts a hand on Floyd's shoulder. "I don't think we can tell them anything that makes more sense than what they already know."

"True," Floyd replies. "So there's no danger in telling them the whole truth, is there?"

"Oddly enough, it is perfect justice without need of evidence. If they truly shared one mind, anyway," says Marcus. "Whatever we do, it's going to be pretty tough to get things back to something approaching normal in this place."

Aura smiles brightly and beautifully as always. "Now their secrets are laid bare. What will help them most now is love for each other, because now they have nothing behind which they can hide." Scrapper stands behind her, watching the ad hoc courtroom with intense curiosity. He starts when he hears these words, and a bright flush spreads across his face.
