Toby Lazarus has been constructing a UFO beneath his scrapyard.

The "UFO" is more like a cylindrical city block than a ship as such. Toby Lazarus has nearly emptied out the supply of iron scrap in his junkyard for raw materials. On paper, the amateurish blueprint he's drawn up makes the thing look like an extremely compressed beer can: a concave base, rounded sides, with indentations on the top for external access. The insides are absurdly minimalist: a core marked "web management" about 20 feet in diameter, situated directly below a control room. The rest is devoted to storage, such as a vehicle garage, sleeping and living quarters, and so forth. About 75% of the available internal volume is designated "DUNNO YET".

The hull is mostly iron sheets and supports, welded together with the best precision Toby, Jason and Colin have been able to muster. It looks crude, but it's sturdy. The old El Dorado where the extraterrestrial component was stored has been moved to the center of the underground structure and incorporated somehow into the whole works.

A handcrafted spiral staircase leads up from the El Dorado's passenger seat to the control room, where a pair of sailing ship's wheels - one vertical, one horizontal - are set up to control the ship's position. A power lever and an oversized numeric keypad are present as well; the keypad is routed into an old Kaypro PC, which in turn is wired electrically into the El Dorado's ignition. The whole thing is a mystery.

To the extent that the UFO can be said to have an interior decor, one might compare it to Early German U-Boat. It's welded iron, molded into useful shapes, and power outlets are wired up at odd intervals. Interior lighting isn't finished yet, and Toby has strung up electrician's work lamps with duct tape through the corridors. There are no hinged doors, only sliding cargo doors here and there in the compartments which have been segmented from the large open body.

Marcus has none of the skills the others put to work in helping Toby, but he does have a fairly impressive bank account and a desire to help his friends. "So, Toby, we don't really know how long this ship has to fly, so I figure the best concept is to use a lot of the space to make a perpetual garden of some kind. I think if we tap into our good friends in the government we can get some suggestions from NASA. We'll want to get this thing prepared for zero-g, too. Unless you have something in mind to get some gravity."

"The Dark Star will push us ahead. I think... this is how rockets do it?" Toby asks. "So, you know, we fly up, we fall down? Something like that?"

Colin looks between Toby and Marcus. "I think what Marcus is saying is that our destination is a long ways away. ANd people like to eat."

Marcus manages to cover his extreme concern for Toby's planning with a nod. "Colin drives directly to the point. We're going to need more than just propulsion to get to wherever it is we're going. I also imagine if you fly in an iron can too long with nothing of the comforts of home you aren't as likely to succeed."

"Oh, haha, yes. My friends, I have that worked out." Toby grins. "You saw the parking level here, of course. So we will have RV hookups. Waste out, water and electricity in. We will need food, of course."

A welding mask emerges overhead, is taken off to reveal Jason's face. "Destination? We've got somewhere in mind for this thing?" He gives the impression of having ignored all aspects of the UFO project that didn't, well, have to do with simply building a UFO.

Toby holds up his hands. "We will work that out when the time comes!" he announces emphatically. "Right now we are still due for a test flight, that is all."

Colin looks at Toby, then at Marcus. "You know, round about to Bernard's Star and back yes?"

"If you can get this baby off the ground, Toby, I'm sure we have enough room for the gardens, waste handling, etc." Marcus looks to Colin and scratches his head, "Honestly I wonder how we're going to fly a few city blocks into the sky without drawing a bit of attention."

Toby nods along in agreement. "Oh, we'll fly at night, Mr. Marcus, please don't concern yourself."

Colin blinks, "I'm sure it's just a weather balloon, Marcus." He walks over to Jason, and ponders, "So, what have we put in for... venelations an the like, my good friend?" He asks, thinking aloud. He seems to be staring straight ahead, but is actually playing with the air in front of him, taking it apart, putting it back together....

"Colin, have you tested to make sure the whole ship is airtight already?" asks Marcus. "Or is the test flight tonight staying in the more comfortable levels of the atmosphere?"

"If energy is a concern, we are getting both 110 and 220 volts through the outlets," Toby says, pulling out a scratch pad and short pencil. He starts doodling figures. "The alternator is good for... hmm... 6500 megawatts right now. I wound the coils myself."

Colin looks over at Toby. "Hey Jason, have you looked at Toby's alternator?" Colin is more than a little concerned. But if it's only a short flight....

Martinez is sitting across the table of a diner, watching Floyd eat. "How are the eggs?" he asks.

Floyd scoops up a forkful of something yellow-white and scrambled. "Edible, with a lot of pepper." He munches carelessly. "Gotta eat on the run a lot lately. I'm sure you heard about the West Virginia thing."

"Yeah." Martinez shifts; something seems wrong with him. "There's a lot of hells a man can imagine, Floyd."

"My parents raised me Catholic," Floyd replies. "I think they'd say that man can't imagine the true Hell, because things can always get worse." He signals for another cup of coffee. "What's eating you, Martinez? Did I screw up?"

"You're functioning normally, Floyd," Martinez replies. Something about his voice changes. "They did come, you know, back in 1947. Just like this time. The men of that time built us, you and me, to take care of it if things happened again." Floyd feels like he's frozen, listening to this sudden burst of strangeness. But that's nothing compared to what happens next: Martinez removes his face entirely, leaving nothing behind but ticking clockwork and electrical components. Nobody else in the restaurant seems to have noticed.

Floyd recoils, moves his hand to his sidearm. He stops just short of pulling it. "What the hell! Who are you?" He spares a glance at the counter; the waitress is working on his coffee, and sounds of activity are still coming from the kitchen. His hand tightens on the pistol grip. "Am I dreaming?"

"You can't dream," the Martinez-thing says. "You're just an imperfect human being. They made us to be guardians of the secrets of the 20th century, not to be people."

Someone must have noticed this 'man without a face' by now; but nobody's reacted at all. Floyd's eyes narrow. "You're screwing with our heads. Made we may be, but I'm no robot. So why tell me I'm one?"

Martinez reaches forward. Floyd feels his body freeze. The man touches his face, then pulls away with something that obscures his vision for a moment. The brief blackness passes, and Martinez holds out his new acquisition for inspection. It's a perfect replica of Floyd's own face, but with blank holes where the eye sockets would be.

Floyd reaches up to feel his face, but stumbles off the stool as he does. He charges out the door of the diner. He swears he can hear his own feet clank and gears wirring in his ears; the hiss of a gas-spring as the door swings open startles him. There's nothing special outside - a few cars in the parking lot off an empty street in a small town. He stumbles to his car, a rented Impala, and desperately studies his face in the driver's door mirror.

The face is exactly like Martinez' own - whirring mechanical components, blinking lights, a nightmare of soulless machinery. Floyd feels a pressure on his shoulder. He's jerked backward away from the sight, and twists around. What he sees is Martinez - with a very worried expression on his very human face. "Hey, Floyd!" the older man yells. "Snap out of it! What happened to you just now?"

Floyd looks carefully at Martinez; even more, he listens. It's the old man's voice, not the weird theatrical parody of a moment ago. "Shit," the Fed grunts. "This case is messing with my head. Let's get back to Scrapper's. You drive. Tell me what I did, and I'll tell you what I saw."

---

The two agents arrive around nightfall; the others have already been busy. Toby's been keen to test his UFO, and privately some of the government researchers have also been very interested in the work that he's doing - enough so that they've written short anonymous notes to Floyd, personally asking him to clear the event (with them on board, of course).

Toby and Aura are waiting outside when the two pull up. Aura, in particular, frowns when she sees Floyd get out of the car, but she says nothing. Toby is all smiles.

"Come aboard, come aboard!" he calls. "After sunset we are going to lift off. I have made all arrangements!"

Floyd notices Aura's frown. As the group walks over to the UFO 'entrance hut', he asks her quietly. "Is there something wrong with me? Did I catch the wrong end of a shard?"

"Something has found you, yes," murmurs Aura. "We will speak later, please." She reaches out a hand from her wheelchair, resting it comfortingly on Floyd's fingers. "I promise it will be okay."

Colin looks over to Floyd, and then once to Toby, "So, where are we going?" He beams a grin, but can't quite hide the fact that he's afraid the old man hasn't planned ahead.

A van pulls up at the property as well. Captain Ellis Tove hops out, then moves around to the side door and opens it. A wheelchair ramp extends, and he helps the other occupant of the vehicle to exit. Other than being human, and with some facial details different, she could be Aura's twin sister.

"I built a ramp inside my office," Toby explains. "We will come this way please. _Dobry wieczorowy, siostra!_" he calls to the woman with Tove.

The way down into the underground structure is through a metal staircase built under a trapdoor in the scrapyard's office building. The procession of footfalls clangs noisily until they reach the bottom. Not surprisingly, the whole thing is built with accessibility in mind: a powered wheelchair ramp is available for both women to use.

Toby guides the way to the control room and indicates where the others should stand. There are rails into which the wheelchairs can be fitted; around the outer wall of the control room are sets of seats taken from a disused schoolbus and fitted with seat belts.

Floyd looks around, worridely, as the enormity of the thing sets in. "Wait, this whole THING is the ship? You have to be kidding. The Hindenberg was smaller!"

"Well, at least this thing isn't full of hydrogen," notes Jason. "I think we'd know about it if it was."

"Ahh, but we are not powered by very explosive fire," points out Toby. "Instead it is the dark star material."

"Actually, Floyd, this is going to be the most massive ship to ever fly on Earth, from what I understand," notes Marcus. "Hm, it may be the largest object to ever move under the power of man, come to think of it."

Colin smiles a bit. "It is quite... large. But it somehow feels homey." He gestures around, since it's basically a large scrapheap.

Toby grins. "Colin! Man the explosive charges, please. Jason, on throttle. I will take the helm. Mr. Marcus, if you will observe the radar.... err.. I think we may have forgotten to install the display, but if you will please just sit there and relax yourself."

Colin blinks, "Explosive charges, boss?"

The junkman nods enthusiastically. "We will blow the dirt away from the property line, allowing us to rise gracefully without straining the hull, you see," he explains.

Colin ers, and looks. "You're the boss, boss...."

Marcus looks to Toby, "Since this is the maiden flight, you really should have some special words prepared, for once we clear the horizon." The paper master whispers to Floyd in a cheery voice, "Assuming we don't all die, anyway."

Toby fishes in his pockets and tosses Floyd a set of car keys. "Please go downstairs and start the El Dorado, Mr. Floyd? Give it plenty of gas. It had trouble turning over this morning, don't let it flood the engine. Alright? Alright, now please go."

Jason wraps his hand around a lever. "Well, look on the bright side," he mutters. "If something _does_ catch fire, the four of us'll do as good a job as a whole fire department."

Floyd catches the keys and moves off. "Please tell me I'm still hearing things," he mutters, but does as he's told.

The car warms up with a satisfying roar, and Floyd immediately begins hearing a strange humming noise as well. "That's normal!" shouts Toby from upstairs. "It is the dark star spinning up! In a moment it'll..." He stops, as a new and distinct sound unlike anything else permeates the cabin. "Yes, it'll do that."

Marcus, deciding that all is well in hand, shapes a bit of paper into a chair and settles down comfortably. "And don't forget to take off the parking brake, Floyd," he calls out. He assumes he's made a joke, but with Toby one can never be certain.

Colin thinks the parking break might be his department, "Should I take it off now, Boss?" His fingers hoving over the level...

"Yes, explosive charges now, Colin!" calls Toby. He reaches for the wheels, putting one hand on each. "Just push the button please. The charges will fire themselves."

Floyd slowly removes his foot from the gas pedal. "So uh... leave it idle?" The humming seems less like a noise and more like a taste. Something he can feel in his teeth. He recalls that Toby merged the 'dark star' with this very same El Dorado.

"Yes, leave it .... uh. Shift into neutral, please!" Toby calls.

Colin covers his eyes with his hand, and presses the button. Possibly shocking to everyone else, but to Colin's surprise, a large chain of explosions rattles the large iron can. The charges are mostly deflected away, but quite a rumble can still be felt underfoot. The whole junkyard rocks as the ship begins to lift from it's foundation.

"Say, Toby, do we have a window somewhere so we can enjoy the view?" asks Marcus casually. He refuses to get ruffled by the sheer insanity that has become the norm of life.

The junkman bobs his head. "We will be opening the .. dorsal and ventral? hatches, I think they are called?" He glances at Tove, who nods approvingly. "Then everyone will be able to see. We have tethers for safety of course. Oh, and we will need to test the altimeter."

Toby then turns to Jason, pointing a finger and grinning. "My friend, full throttle!"

Jason looks at Toby nervously. Sometimes, Toby's enthusiasm is a bit too much even for him. ...and then he grins widely. "Whatever you say, boss!" he says, shoving the lever over... though he gets a strong grip, both with his muscles and his Link, just in case full throttle throws him to the floor.

The bad news is that the throttle sticks a couple notches up from zero. The good news is that this is quite sufficient.

The entire iron fortress heaves and groans, and a shivering makes its way through the superstructure. The crew can feel the hand of gravity pressing them downward. Toby glances around him, taking in the farrago of controls and avionics he's thrown together and grinning wildly. "Ease off!" he commands after a few seconds.

Jason does as he's asked. "We probably should open the windows, so we can see where we're going," he remarks.

Floyd stumbles up the ramp from the 'engine room'. "Big aircraft always fly on instruments anyway," he quips, looking meaningfully at Tove.

Tove laughs, but his voice betrays a certain nervousness. "The radar should be wired in, we just need to hook up the scope. But the altimeter should..." He glances over as he speaks, and catches his breath. "Wow."

Floyd says, "'Wow'? What wow?"

Colin's head glances over too. "Wow usually isn't good... when you're talking about altemeters, and...."

The craft heaves to a stop, and the painful downward pressure ceases. Tove immediately jumps up. "Come on, boys," he announces. "We need to get radar hooked up. Toby, get out the radio from the toolbox please, you're almost at the ceiling. Floyd, you come with me, we may need you on the radio."

Jason gets up from his chair. "So. Just out of curiosity, you understand," he says, his voice forced to be calm as he looks at Toby. "_How_ high?"

A sudden shift in the attitude of the craft sends everyone almost sprawling. "Come on!" Tove yells, breaking into a run after regaining his balance. The tilt of the deck makes it hard, but he does what he can. "We need to get to the toolshed."

The sudden tilt sends Jason sprawling as he moves to follow Toby. "Hell with this," he says, and doesn't bother getting to his feet, instead reverting to flight.

Marcus gets to his feet and shifts with the roll of ship, managing it with uncharacteristic grace. "I hope we're getting airline miles for this!"

Floyd straps himself into a bus seat, in front of a rack of brand-new aviation radios and navigation aids. Scrapper has obligingly fitted a quad speaker system from an old Pinto, but they play nothing but static. "Oh, hell. All the frequencies are off." He gets to work retuning.

Everyone is sprawling for the electronics and control systems - Tove, Jason and Colin all know more or less how it works, but it's Jason who is first to get the radar set plugged in.

The ship almost immediately rights itself with a loud groan. "That's what I get for arguing safety with Toby," Captain Tove mutters to himself wryly. He grins at the others. "Come on, let's head back. I'll explain."

Back in the control room, Tove gestures. "We tried to make it safer. Ironically it backfired. You see, past a certain point, we could see the curvature of the earth and we'd start to lose our orientation. So I had a programmer friend right some code that fed radar readings into the attitude control. The ship would steady itself at most altitudes. Except, we didn't get everything plugged in after all."

Marcus is quite pleased to be away from the electronics, "So, now that we've got that down, perhaps it's time to.. what is it we are going to check again? We've certainly got off the ground."

"'How high' would be a good start," Floyd says. "Over 12000 feet and we have to worry about airliners."

Colin blinks for a second, "Something like.. what.. 30,000 and we have to start worring about air?" He glances at the air for a second, trying to deduce oxygen content around here....

"So can someone now answer the simple question of 'where are we'?" asks Marcus.

"We are...." Toby holds up a hand, looking at his instruments. "10,000 feet up, just above the junkyard. Yes. So.." He flips open a box and pulls a hidden lever; the humming from downstairs decreases slightly. "Controls locked. Let us take stock. And uh, I also have some Budweiser in the fridge."

Floyd continues to work the radio. "Ten thousand feet. Good. Small planes won't be this high and airliners won't be this low. My God, we might be according to plan after all!"

Colin thinks, "Hatches.. Hatches..." He wanders to one side of the room... "Here we are..." He says, as he finds a lever. He pulsl it, and the roan of iron machinery can be heard. THe hatches begin to open downward. As their seal is broken, a minor hiss of the pressure escaping the ship can be heard, as it works to equalize the pressure between our city block and 10,000 feet. THe hatches drop themselves down, and reveal .... The landscape below...

As the hatch opens Marcus does the prudent thing, and with a ruffling of paper forms the dragon, its form just the right size to take advantage of the huge hatch. If anyone falls, there's something that can try to catch them, now.

Toby emerges from the control room and heads toward the hatch, wheeling Aura along with him. The other woman comes as well. "I'm Shala Tove," she announces, in an accent similar to Toby's. "So pleasure to meet you all, I've heard everything." And smiling, she nods to Aura. "And it is so nice to meet you at last, my dear."

Aura smiles gently and inclines her head. "I thank you for everything you've done for Toby," she says, and Shala smiles in return. The two women seem to have exchanged some ineffable secret between them.

Marcus nods politely to Shala, and does his best to reveal none of his uncertainties at the moment. "Looks like it worked out alright, Toby. We're up a fair ways and sailing smooth."

Floyd nods politely. The similarity between Aura and Shala is striking; it reinforces a thought he had long ago. "We're lucky this happened to Scrapper," he asides to Marcus.

Tove jogs off and returns after a minute, arms loaded with beer. "We're flying, ladies and gentlemen," he announces. "So drink up and enjoy the fruits of your hard labor."

Colin glances at Floyd, "Careful, the fuzz is around. THey might tag you for FWI...."

Colin's ceerful grin across his face betrays that he is, of course, joking.

Jason laughs. "Yeah, I was gonna say," he says, selecting a beer for himself. "Who _is_ the DD here anyway?"

"I don't think I can get drunk," muses Aura. "And Toby has showed me the basics of steering. So please relax, and enjoy yourselves."

Floyd retrieves a thermos with a pervasive aroma of cheap, strong coffee. "I'll stay sober. That makes it legal. I mean, what the hell, it's not like the FAA is watching right now."

Marcus smiles at Toby, "Thank you my friend, but for now I want to keep my wits about me." He looks out the hatch and sets a hand on the dragon at his side, "I don't know why, but I feel strange. Wary."

Floyd says, "Help me, then," Floyd says to Marcus. "Part of the deal is that we make measurements for JPL and NASA. Can your dragon work a camcorder?"

"Man, you guys are such wet blankets," Jason says, smiling. "Bah, you've got a point. I'll just have the one," he says, waving his bottle. "We can have the big booze-up when we land."

Outside the hatch, the group hears a faint, distant buzzing noise.

Colin looks out the hatch.

"An airplane!" calls Tove; he recognizes it about the same time as Floyd does. "That guy's gonna hit us!"

Floyd runs for the radio. "Shit, how can he not see us?"

"Shit!" yells Jason, making a flying leap for the throttle. "Up or down?!" he yells.

Sure enough, there's a slight noise that emanates from the hull.

"Do what you can!" calls Marcus. He leans into the dragon and vanishes inside it. The great form rushes forward, racing out towards the plane.

"He went over us. Scraped the top deck," Tove estimates. "Marcus! Colin! Jason! Get out there! He must be going down."

Jason reverses course in mid-air, less than halfway to the controls. "Right!" he yells, flying back the way he came and down through the hatch, grabbing a handful of paper dragon.

Colin jumps into the dragon, "If you can just get me close...." He looks at Marcus, ready to follow.

Floyd retrieves the grapple beam, and then charges into the expanding mass of paper. "Marcus, don't drop us!"

A wild series of sparks emanates from the work lights and Tove glances up. "Toby, with me - the electrical harness. Let's go!"

As the dragon clears the base of the UFO, and everyone can see the single-engine turboprop spiral toward the ground, Jason picks out the person on a different trajectory. "Marcus, Floyd! You get the plane, I'll get the guy!" Without further ado, Jason jumps loose and rides the air toward the plummeting pilot.

Marcus keeps his eyes on the plane, "I hope the damn thing doesn't break up!" he shouts out. The dragon beats its wings, forcing itself into greater and greater speeds in the pursuit of the fatally wounded aircraft.

Floyd takes aim with the beam. He can't really lift the whole plane; but he can brake the fall and steer it. There's no way to tell the weapon; it just seems to sense his intension as he pulls the trigger.

Floyd blinks. For a moment, it almost looked like the device had plugged something into a metallic port in his arm. He blinks, but it's gone.

Colin climbs to the top of the Dragon and just waits, his Nodachi behind him, watchign the rescue attempt, waiting for the need, watching for people or things.

Marcus focuses intently on his target. He's never flown the dragon this fast, and he urges it one, trying to figure out just what terminal velocity is like. The plane is hardly an easy target. Without a pilot it's flying around like a bird with a broken wing.

Colin glances back at Marcus and Floyd, and curses, "Damn." As he sees that the plane is going to fall apart. He jumps into the air, his steps not hitting anything, but still gaining speed. The Nodachi in his hands now, as the swordsteel, a fiery edge upon it, slices through the frame of the plane. His feet stop against the frame of the plane, and he ducks into tha cabin, checking the occupant in there...

The grapple beam emits a golden tangle of energy which locks onto different parts of the plane. Unfortunately, it's too big; Floyd accidentally tears off parts of the plane without catching the whole thing. "It's gonna break up no matter what we do! Marcus, you gotta catch the whole thing! I can only steer it!"

"Right!" calls back Marcus. The whole thing. The dragon's insides are fairly roomy, but an airline hangar they are not. "I think I have an idea! Stay close to me here.. this is gonna be a hell of a ride."

Jason pulls out of his flat dive. "Hey!" he calls, and, getting no response, reaches out a hand to stop the pilot's tumbling, then grabs him with both hands, wrapping a layer of air around him as well. He decelerates slowly - noting that the pilot appears to be injured - and watches the plane continue to tumble past, the paper dragon matching speeds. "Good luck, guys," he whispers, and heads back for the saucer.

Colin bends into the cockpit, rent open by his sword, and carefully drags the girl out. He looks her up and down, "She's hurt..." As he carefully balances her over his shoulder, he starts to run across the air back to the dragon.

The dragon is finally within range of the plane, and Marcus urges the great beast to engulf the top of the plane, whipping its tail and legs about it to cradle it tight to its chest. With all the volume pressed inside, Marcus and Floyd have very little room to maneuver. Marcus doesn't have to move, though, he can feel the incredible strain of the weight already, and it feels as if he were lifting it himself.

Floyd scans the horizon for a body of water big enough to safely ditch the small plane. There isn't one... but the spaceship must have left an enormous hole in Scrapper's junkyard. "Marcus! Let's just divert the thing! Straight down in the hole we made at launch!" He raises the grappler again and fires, brushing aside a nagging suspicion that the weapon is cursed.

Marcus nods to Floyd and the dragon's wings go to work, fanning out in a vast arc to rush the crumbling plane to a fitting gravesite. "Crumbly as a dry cookie," mutters Marcus. He pauses to reach out and draw upon another helper, and into the cavity of the dragon a paper cat appears, whipping strange tentacles out to take greater hold of the plane below.

The combined efforts of two paper golems takes a lot of the strain off. Marcus looks merely focused now, and not like he's doing himself injury. Assured that Colin and Jason have saved all the passengers, Marcus releases the plane the moment things are clear below. As a final gesture of safety, the dragons talons sweep down, ensuring that there are no incidents involving a spinning prop in one of the most direct of ways.

With the plane incident behind them, Marcus sends the dragon skyward once more, racing towards the flying fortress.

"Is there a doctor in the house?" Jason exclaims as he rises through the UFO's hatch, cradling the pilot in his arms. "This man's hurt!" He lays the man carefully on the deck, looking around frantically for a first aid kit.

Tove's got the ship's first aid kits on deck and has been standing by to assist when the two were brought in.

Colin climbs the stair to the fortress with his own parcel, laying her in the hold.....

Floyd sees to Colin's passenger, the woman who was stuck in the plane.

Colin looks down at the woman's injuries, and tries to patch them up as best he can, but seems to make a worse mess of things than when he started, "I think she's goign to need serious help.." Colin calls out....

The pair are stabilized. And everyone can't help but be aware of the stench of alcohol on the couple. This, at least, explains a few things.

Floyd says, "Toby, any chance you've got stretchers on this thing? We might have to fly them to a hospital, and the Dragon has no seats."

"Shit on a stick," murmurs Tove, having seen what the group just did. He shakes himself free. "Yeah, let me clear off some of our workbenches and wheel them out here." Toby nods, and starts jogging toward the control room. "I'll set course!" he calls. "Jason, Colin, assist me, please?"

"Flying while drunk. Jesus," Floyd groans. "And we were about to do the same. Well. Maybe it was lucky they ran into us after all."

Marcus can only form stretchers of paper. "This reminds me, we'll need a sickbay.. and someone who can make use of it." When Tove returns the paper master will gently ease the injured couple down.

Colin nods, "But of course...." He runs over to Toby, and does whatever is required.

As things calm down, Aura wheels herself over to Floyd. "Let's speak now," she murmurs. "So... you have been touched by a link. Something has insinuated itself into your brain. But it is not a rogue link. The good news is that I can remove it for you. The bad news is.. that there is someone else on this planet that can control links."

Floyd spends several seconds sputtering. "Wait... someone ELSE? Who? How?"

"I don't know." Aura bites her golden lip and looks away. "But remember that I was seemingly sent here to invade this planet... and the only thing that halted that was the compassion of Toby Lazarus. What if another came here, another of my kind who came into a form not so... benevolent?"

Colin looks at Aura, "So, the super villian appears, eh..."

Floyd nods. "Yeah. I get it. Well, that makes this a lot more serious." He finds Tove. "We should land, get these people to a hospital. I think there's a lot more work to do."
