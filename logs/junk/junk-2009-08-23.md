# Junkyard Heroes 2009-08-23

Newton Benford and the smiling youth named Hugh have crossed beyond the Chaos Frontier. Now they stand overlooking a glassy crater where once stood New York City. In the far distance, packs of mutant biker gangs are combing the ruins of this once-great urban center, while a few fearful survivors huddle in their shelter and eat the last scraps of food they can find. In this echo of the true earth, nuclear holocaust has claimed the planet.

"Destruction," says Hugh softly. "It can be an ugly thing, can't it?"

Benford can't help but be disturbed by the scene. Though he knows it is only an echo of the 'true world', there are people suffering here and now. He feels out of place, well fed, and dressed in academic garb. "When I was a kid we were always worried that this was how it would turn out," he says softly. "What did we get right, that these people got wrong?"

Hugh cocks his head. "Get right? Well, Western civilization got lucky. You had food, shelter, medicine, and some sort of notion of law, right?" He laughs quietly. "But you have starving, hungry, desperate people all over the world in your reality too."

Benford nudges a piece of rubble with his toe. "I've come to understand that we're not meant to make everything 'safe' either. If that was all we wanted we could let the Maker win."

Hugh grins. "You got it. Because human beings, as much as you want to sometimes think of yourselves as creative or protective, are really something else." He turns to look the scientist in the eye. "You - and I - are the sleeping god of destruction."

Benford hides his surprised poorly. "Hey, that hardly seems complementary! I though we were - are - the sleeping god of Decision. One way or the other, in the face of the Wyld."

"Destruction is decision," explains Hugh with a soft smile. "Have you considered that?"

Benford can't help but look sullen. "Is that what you brought me here to learn?"

"Yes." Hugh gestures. Far in the distance, a glowing ball of light appears in Benford's vision. "As a scientist, then. There is Truth," he explains. And the intervening space, barriers begin to appear - wooden planks, steel fences, mounds of dirt. Each has a printed label, a sign affixed to it. Benford makes out some of the words on them. Newtonian Gravity. The Ether. Ptolemaic Astronomy. Freudian Psychology.

Benford chuckles. "Ah, yes. Now I see your point, or part of it, anyway. How very Kuhnian."

"Human beings express their true nature through everything they do, not just science. But to bring about a new understanding, the old one must be torn down and relegated to obsolescence. It's just as true in a marriage as in a laboratory, you know."

Hugh paces slowly. The barriers disappear; instead, a table appears before him and he comes to a stop at its edge. On the table is a block of potter's clay. "To make a sculpture, you destroy the medium, do you not?" he asks, gesturing at it.

"Do we?" Benford picks up the lump, then sets it down again; out in the Chaos Frontier, dialoguing with the very Spirit of Man, it seems a poor choice to indulge in arbitrary creative acts. "We destroy the potential that it will be otherwise... the atoms and energy remain. All we consume is... possibility, I suppose. That's still true with Essence, right? That part of thermodynamics we don't escape."

"Yes. But clay isn't just potential. It really is a block of clay. It was something." Hugh smiles. "What I ask is that you embrace your nature as God of Destruction, doctor. And like an artist, that comes with a complication - _that you be deliberate in what you choose to destroy_. Be mindful of what you shape of the world. And of Autochthon."

Benford looks around the blasted crater. That he and Hugh are chatting amiably is strange, considering to the horror that this place represents. "Tell me, then. We make something of Autocthon - and of ourselves, I suppose. How do we get something worthwhile, instead of this?" His arm encompasses the sweep of the glass crater. "The Solar spark guides us to the fantastic and excellent." He kneels in front of the clay table. "Can we get that, for everybody?" He looks back at Hugh. "Did _He_ want that, too?"

Hugh grins. "I can't say right now. No, really, I mean I literally can't tell you. But when the time is right, you will see the great work of the God of Destruction, and I hope you will be proud of it."

Benford stands again. "I've been too timid, I think." He reaches out for the clay. "I am already proud of what man has wrought. So then... no more fear. 'Look on my works, ye humble, and rejoice.'" With preternatural skill, the scientist molds the lump of mere clay into an effigy of the boy before him. "Not what Shelley wrote, but he always was such a poof."
