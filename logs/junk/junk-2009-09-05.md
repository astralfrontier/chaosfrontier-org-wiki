# Junkyard Heroes 2009-09-05

The second alien - Aura's "backup" - was either at the lab, or still is. This much is clear. Amos Finch, the human quisling who traded his planet's safety for a link to carbon, has been put under a battering round of rapid interrogation after his capture.

Whatever gave Finch his link must have been in the debris that was taken back to Brookhaven for analysis. Under the influence of sodium pentathol, the man ocnfesses that he expected to find some sort of other invasion mechanism, but thought that such a discovery could be of use to him. As with Toby and his ideal creation Aura, Finch apparently got just exactly what he expected.

The team heads back to Brookhaven in short order. Only a few hours have passed - but if this alien is as much in touch with its partner as Aura is with Scrapper, it probably already knows that the jig is up.

In the skunk works' offices, Floyd and the others learn an interesting piece of news: 'Amos Finch', at the very moment the real scientist was fighting the group at Subway, was signing transfer papers to have the wreckage moved offsite. Somehow, the second alien either mimicked or duplicated Finch's appearance, along with enough of his memories to make a convincing facsimile.

Tracking shows that it was bound for a military base down south; somewhere far enough away that the alien could presumably make a head start and try to break the chain of paperwork. Two squads of soldiers were sent thanks to the cooperation of the Army. If the alien can't simply kill them all outright, it need only wait for a moment to strike. There may still be time to catch up with the convoy.

There's one obvious way to catch up with the other protoform in a hurry. Marcus and Toby take the paper dragon to the Lazarus junkyard, and return in minutes with the UFO. Nobody waits around to explain the arrival of the machine to the shocked scientists at the Brookhaven lab.

Before the departure, the hopeful heroes request reinforcements. Using Floyd's rank as well as possible, a squad of army troops is added to the mix. "Well, hopefully our powers can be used in a way that will grant us a quick victory," says Marcus. "At this point I think keeping our heads down is an obsolete notion."

"Good," Floyd says. "The people deserve to know. Besides," he motions around the cavernous steel hangar. "We're so bad at subtle anyway."

Colin looks over at Floyd, 'Where do you think they'd have gotten too by now?

Floyd stands next to the rack of expensive navigation gear, and pulls out a $1 road map. "If they really are heading south, like the orders say, it will be on I-95. At this time of day, given light traffic, that will put them in New Jersey... on the Turnpike." He points at the map. "Somewhere along here." He looks where his finger has fallen. "Oh, that's funny." The spot on the map is marked 'Grover's Mill', a few miles west of the Turnpike.

"So how public do we want to go now, Floyd?" asks Marcus. "Should I launch the dragon and rocked along, or are we content to merely show off this UFO of ours?"

"The UFO is faster to start," Floyd replies, "but be ready to launch when we get there. Toby? Please take us up."

"Zatanczymy!" yells Toby, taking hold of the controls of his gigantic steel craft. The others take their stations. "Let's dance." A rocking motion puts everyone momentarily off their balance, and a shuddering squeal edges through the superstructure. But the craft lifts off, its complement of soldiers and civilians aboard.

The black saucer wobbles in air. There's a police siren after a few moments, and the entire disc starts to spin in place. "Stabilizer!" yells Toby, and Captain Tove calls back, "compensating..." The spin subsides. Slowly, ponderously, the disc picks up forward momentum.

"According to the aerometer thingie here," Toby announces, "we shall be breaking the speed of sound in..." His words are cut off by a sudden and deafening whine of tortured metal. "Okay, I think that was it," he finishes lamely. "Tove, what's this called?" "Airspeed indicator." "It is speedometer, like in car. "No, it's an airspeed indicator in an airplane." "This is not airplane, comrade."

Colin looks between the two in disbelief. "So... when do we need to start stopping?"

Colin and Jason busy themselves with their instruments, while Floyd inspects the GPS unit that's been wired to an antenna on the roof. The GPS is no longer giving an indication; most likely this means the antenna's been sheared off. Tove, perhaps anticipating this, comes up the staircase to the control room with a stopwatch in hand. "40 seconds," he announces. "Then you should start decelerating. Floyd, want to head topside so we can get GPS reception? My unit failed too."

"Next time, we put windows in this thing," Floyd quips, and moves off.

Colin reaches over, and turns down the throttle, and even applying a little reverse to keep it from drifting too far, he looks around, "You're surrounded by Iron, probably a lot of it magnetized..."

The UFO churns to a stop. All instruments show zero speed. "Time for dragon to find the truck," Toby grins, turning to his friend. "Can you do it, Mr. Marcus?"

The answer is made with the sudden eruption of the paper dragon from Marcus' briefcase of paper. "Of course," he says calmly. The great beast lunges over him, as if to crush the paper master, and then swoops outside, carrying him down to have a look. Over a radio, Marcus says, "I'll keep you in the loop."

Departing the UFO with a trio of soldiers and a radio, Marcus' paper steed flies groundward. To avoid alerting the truck that's hauling the wreckage - and to avoid alerting 'Finch', who is reportedly still with the crew - nobody can simply ask it for its position. But the group has a good idea. No other Army transport trucks are in the area, and the local police won't tip off the quarry.

In a few minutes, Marcus is able to surveil the vehicle through high-powered binoculars. He swoops down for a closer look, mindful of detection, using white clouds to mask the white paper dragon from visual inspection. Sure enough, the truck has been found.

"I've got them in sight," says Marcus. "What's my next move? Should I try to take the whole truck or do you have a better plan?"

Colin has an idea as Marcus takes his paper dragon out to find their quarry. He finda Aura in one of the control towers. "So, we're going to go up against your backup... What do you suggest? Is there any way to neutralize them?"

In response, Aura hands over a thin envelope with Toby's name on it. "Please give this to Toby if something happens to me," she says. "I need to join you when you confront the other."

Colin looks at Aura, and takes the envelope solemly. He opens his mouth to speak, but decides that silence is the better option, he turns, and departs, off to find the rest of the crew

From the roof, Floyd can see the late afternoon traffic moving smoothly along the highway . Somewhere down there is the convoy... and a few miles south, the toll plaza at Hightstown. "We can't just drop in there, guns blazing..." He grins as an idea comes to him, and pulls out his phone. "I hope the Turnpike Authority is a union shop..."

Floyd comes below a minute later. "Just got off the phone with the state police. Very shortly, there's only going to be one open toll lane south of here. That's going to cause a godawful traffic jam. Our quarry will either stop in their tracks, or be forced onto surface streets. Either way, it slows them down. As soon as that happens, we land and make the bust."

"We've also called the Army," Floyd adds, "to recall the convoy... quietly. So maybe the fake Finch won't get spooked and try to kill them."

With ruthless efficiency, the Turnpike Authority closes down all but one southbound lane, and as predicted, traffic slows to a crawl. The wave of cars builds, visible first to Marcus, then from the ship. "Now," Floyd says, "We drop in on them."

The UFO approaches the convoy at tree-top height, and lands on a golf course next to the highway. Everyone is waiting in one of the hangars; Aura's presence is a surprise to most.

Marcus waits for everyone to get in position, then does his thing. It's excessively dramatic, perhaps, but it works. The enormous paper dragon swoops down before the unmoving transport and gun slits open for the soldiers inside to take aim. Marcus shouts out in a commanding voice, "Step out of the vehicle with your hands on your head and surrender!" Sure, it'll never happen that way, but this is what the good guys are obliged to say.

One of the soldiers with Marcus begins barking orders as several of the grunts in the truck go for their guns. "By order of General Wellington," he shouts, almost chewing each word as he shouts it out, "you are hereby ordered to stand down! Dr. Amos Finch! You will be taken into custody! _Move it!_" This appearance of authority - and from a fellow soldier no less - is taken much better than Marcus' civilian challenge.

"You need to show us your authorization, and we need to call this in," the driver answers back. In response, the man with Marcus snaps out a piece of paper from his uniform pocket and presents it for inspection. "Sir, I need to speak to the convoy driver about this order," he directs to Marcus.

A larger access port is provided for the soldier, while his fellows remain alert, pointing their weapons through the holes Marcus provided. Finch steps out of the cavernous back of the truck, hands on his head, escorted by two soldiers with their weapons out. He has a smile on his face, and watches Marcus with amusement.

The driver begins calling on the radio for confirmation. As he does, a scream goes up from behind him. Those men guarding Finch have met a quick and nameless death in a manner that sears itself into Marcus' memory in a wave of shock. The flesh literally falls from their bones, leaving behind a pair of skeletons that keel over.

Before anyone can react, Finch shouts. "Hold! They all die if you open fire." The soldiers aboard the dragon, almost ready to squeeze the trigger, keep a tight aim but look to Marcus fearfully, silently seeking guidance.

The others arrive in time for the latter part of the standoff. Aura is with them, and she frowns. "He is linked to living things," she whispers.

Floyd steps forward carefully, FBI ID in one hand, grapple beam in the other... but pointing groundward. He's reminded of when he was called to sort out the problem with Toby and Aura, in the junkyard; he knew then, somehow, that there was an easy solution; that everything would be alright. He's not nearly so sure now. He stops a hundred feet from 'Finch.'

The alien's features contort, taking on for a moment the visage of Martinez. "So trusting," he sneers at Floyd.

"We don't want a war," Floyd says simply, "and I'm willing to die to prevent one. Finch is not typical of us."

"It doesn't matter! I'm going to do what I was _meant_ to do," answers the creature. "And not you, and not you, and not..." He points from person to person, stopping when he gets to Aura. "Her. Surrender her to me, and I'll let the soldiers go."

Jason looks at his hand. The ability to manipulate nitrogen seems meaningless now. Whatever this thing is, it probably doesn't need to breathe, and he cannot imagine what he could do to it, even if he could hold on to his Link, before it could slaughter the soldiers, and who knows what else besides. "What can we do?" he murmurs softly."

Marcus narrows his eyes, then retorts, "So you are here to kill us, but if we surrender her, you will give us a few moments? If you are so powerful, you wouldn't be negotiating."

"Conquest doesn't mean killing," the alien retorts. "You could submit peacefully, and survive. You could die of old age. If you cooperate, in fact.. I might even be able to fix that for you."

"But so can Aura, right?" Floyd asks. "Have you asked yourself why she isn't invading us? Have you asked her?"

Colin says, "So... Live free ot never die as your slave? Is sort of basically the choice here?"

The alien laughs unpleasantly. "It's no longer your world. Now send over.. her... or a few more GIs will die. Protecting your freedom, I guess. How fortunate for them."

"It's what soldiers are made to do," replies Marcus flatly. "And if you knew the first thing about humans, you'd know that submission has never been our strong point."

Aura wheels slowly forward. "Let them go," she says calmly. "I'll come."

Colin steps in front of Aura. He looks at her. "It doesn't need to go this way...."

Floyd doesn't take his eyes off the invader; for some reason, he was expecting something like this, when Aura came aboard the dragon. "Now why the hell would she want to do that?" he asks.

The golden woman looks up at Colin. Her smile could be that of an angel as she touches his hand. "I need you now, more than ever. All of you. Don't forget what I gave you." And again she wheels forward.

Jason gently urges Colin out of her way. "Do you have any better idea?" he says. And then raises an eyebrow, nodding toward 'Finch'.

Aura's chair comes close to Finch and she looks up at him, then over at Toby, who is staring the hate of a thousand hells at Finch. A few drops of blood are dripping from his hands; his palms are being cut open by the fists he's made. "They're safe now. But she and I are going to have a chat. And if anything happens to me, it happens to her," the alien promises.

"Toby," Aura says with a smile. "Don't forget me. And.. I'm sorry, but I need to borrow the dark star again. I hope you parked the ship somewhere safe." And with a sudden motion, her hand plunges to the elbow into the flesh of Finch. It isn't a simple penetration of skin; it's more of a melding or a sliding, similar to what the linked fighters have seen before in the bodily transformations of the rogue links they fought. Finch gives vent to a tortured, inhuman scream, and the two bodies begin to physically join.

A black blast wave washes over everyone. Aura and Finch have combined, slowly solidifying into what looks to be a completely reflective sphere of metal. The linked people watching can feel a turbulent struggle going on 'inside'; outwardly, there's no sign at all of a disturbance.

Colin looks at the sphere, as he feels his link 'react' to it. He reaches out his hand, fo rthe now familiar feel of the oxygen swirling around it.

Jason puts a hand to his forehead. "I..." he says. "Colin, Marcus, Toby... I have a feeling this won't end quietly. Be ready..."

Floyd raises the Grappler; or maybe it raises itself. Through the vents on the side of the device, he can see orange and blue light swarming within it. "Get them out of here," he says to the Army lieutenant beside him. "All the men, all the trucks. Clear the area. Clear the fucking state if you can.

Colin looks over at Toby, and pulls the envelope out of his shirt, "Aura wrote this." Colin is very terse, as he forces the envelope into Toby's hands...

Marcus diverts his attention to making a wall, but he has this feeling that if bad things are going down, the wall of paper will hardly have more affect than a casual observer might expect. "Things like this never go the way we expect or want," he growls to himself.

Colin stares at the sphere, and looks a the crew. "She said she needed us. I wonder what that means to her..."

Toby opens the envelope, pushing back tears with the knuckles of his hands. "Aura," he whispers, and begins to read aloud in a husky voice. "To Toby Lazarus and all my friends... If you are reading this, I am confronting the other passenger of my vessel. This will be difficult for me. It may be more powerful than I, but I think that it only linked to one person. And so I will need all of you. You are my family.." He stops, choking up, and passes the letter to Marcus with a trembling hand.

Jason leans over and looks over Marcus' shoulder. "That's it..." he whispers, looking up at the sphere. "Guys... I'm about to do something that might be mind-bogglingly stupid." And with that, he walks toward the sphere, hand outstretched.

Marcus accepts it and gravely continues. ".. You are my family and you must now fight the hardest fight in our time together. I need you all to be human - to support each other, to support those around you, to be what you wish most to be. That strength will bolster me through the link we share. That strength will let me prevail. Above all, when you feel your own links severed, the contest is over..."

Jason's hand rests on the sphere. Within it he can feel a cyclone of emotion and hatred and resistance. It is a primal struggle of mind against mind, will against will, purpose against purpose. It is a single consciousness divided against itself, experiencing a fit of in what human beings would be profound madness.

"I get it," Floyd says. "The difference between Aura and the other alien, is all in who they met first when they came here. Who she imprinted from, who she linked to. We're the difference. We're what she's got over him." He pauses. "But what do we _do_?"

Jason takes his hand away. "He's in there still. They're both in there. It's... like a war of mind against mind." He shakes his head. "But I don't know what we do about it, either."

The letter concludes. ".. It is vital that _nobody observe us in our struggle_ after your links are severed. Whoever comes upon us will shape the final outcome of what happens, if I am victorious. Aura is gone. But you may discover something like me again. Remember that what you expect is what will become truth. I love you all."

Colin looks at the letter, then at the sphere. "So... We need to either move it, or take up residence here... " He looks at Floyd, "How much land can we get?"

As Jason feels the contest going on, he feels something else. Something reaching for him, something delving into his mind and his character. It is a profound _need_ - a wish that he feel something. And he recognizes it. It is Aura's need to be bolstered by him.

"I understand," says Marcus. "We have our links, still, right?" He looks around, and suddenly smiles, "We need to be super heroes, we need to chase our dreams. We need to channel all our energy, all that is good in us, and stoke it until it's a fire that can burn all else away."

Marcus grows more animated and excited, "Don't you see? She has us. She needs us to use these powers to improve our world, to be the best we can be. And more than that, even beyond the links, in all ways... chase our dreams, and let nothing stand in our way."

"For how long?" Floyd asks, shock showing in his voice. "How long does she have to fight this thing? And what are we supposed to do with this thing until then? Hide it in a salt mine?"

"Until our links break," says Marcus. "And I suggest we find a way to not disturb it, and keep people away. We have a lot of work to do."

Colin looks at Floyd, "Well, right now a golf course seems slightly more likely, don't you think?" He looks at the sphere, and then the paper, "I expect this to last... quite a while..."

"It could be years, or months... or hours," says Jason. "I don't know if I fully understand what's going on now. But... what Marcus says makes sense. We hide this away..." he says, brushing the sphere again. "And then... we make the most of what we are. Whatever that may be."

"Really it's what we ought to do anyway," says Marcus. "We live our lives, we do what is right. We make whatever time the world has the best time it's ever seen." He extends a hand, palm-down, waiting for the others to join him, "And we do it together!"

Jason smiles and places his hand atop Marcus's. "Amen to that."

Colin looks at Marcus' hand, and looks back up to Marcus, "That's almost too hokey for me..." He places his hand atop the others, and murmurs, "Almost."

"I've got no link," Floyd says, "but I'm proud to be Uncle Sam's point man here." He adds his hand to the pile. "That's enough for me."

Colin beams at Floyd, "Sometimes I think you manage to do more than us, Floyd."

Floyd says, "Then first things first," Floyd says. "We don't know how long this will go on, but it seems like whatever else happens, we have to keep that out of sight." He points at the sphere. "Let's get it to the UFO, and see if it will still move. And if it does... we find a place to put it."

The sphere is transported carefully over to the golf course and sealed away inside the UFO. Toby erects a lightless and soundless containment closet for it, and the Army has no trouble posting a permanent watch.

The UFO itself is motionless. The 'dark star' is present, but quiescent. Its other systems, like the supplemental generators, work just fine. But for now, it won't be flying anywhere.

During the transport, Floyd is contacted by Maurer, General Wellington, and other brass. "Something's happening. We're taking you out of direct control on this matter," the general explains frankly. "We're receiving reports of machines - weapons of war - coming out of the ground. We trust Aura. You did your job - we trust you to keep doing it. But this new matter is too big for one man, no matter who that man is."

"General, this job may be too large for one man," answers Marcus, "Fortunately Floyd is not alone. Our powers are at his disposal, of course, directed with our best judgement to serve the greater good of all the Earth. Would you say the rest of the world is prepared to do the same?"

"In spite of your admirable bravery, sir, we have something else for you." The general chuckles over the phone. "You're still deputized members of the national law enforcement apparatus. Leave fighting to the Army. But if this turns as ugly as it might - if we really are facing an invasion - there's going to be a lot of people scared or hurt. It's them you should turn your attentions to."

Jason, listening to the conversation, nods to himself. "Protecting the civilians rather than fighting the invasion. I can live with that."

"Sir," Floyd replies, "LI-13 is a civillian organization. It seems like we - and they - are positioned to fill that role. I suggest we proceed as such."

"We're getting reports now ... Dammit, I thought Finch was joking," Wellington says over the phone. "When we told him where you'd gone, he just laughed and said 'perfect'. That damn alien's raising tripods out of the ground."

Floyd has trouble speaking for a while. "If I recall correctly, General," he finally says, "at least that's one we win in the end."
