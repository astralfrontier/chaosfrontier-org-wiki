# Junkyard Heroes 2009-10-03

The minions of Autochthon have spread themselves across the world. Cultists of the Machine God erect hives of transtechnology which vomit forth a thousand new machines of war, while his Alchemical servants bully and persuade and cajole and compel, using the knowledge of humanity they have acquired in their various experiments.

In the poorer, more desperate parts of the world, enclaves have sprung up. Though without a strong technological base, the Machine God promises citizens of a village or town or city the sort of safe haven they have so long been denied. The urban dwellers are knit together into a hive mind, based on neurocytes, and directed as a single unit.

The more well-to-do regions of the planet are colonized in a different fashion: the promise of vices and pleasures and conveniences, the same siren song that has called to man ever since the discovery of fire. New substances burrow their way into the brain, cross-connecting synapses and trading a few hours' pleasure for an eternity of addiction.

In some parts of the world, outright war has broken out - Alchemicals simply replace local warlords or tribal leaders, reprogramming or bullying their new subjects into fighting for their cause.

This effort does not go unhindered.

---

Across the world, the soldiers of the Solar Deliberative go forth. Men and women, clear-eyed and clear of thought, their doubts and fears washed away by the promise of truth and hope, bring a message of martial duty and potential peace to the nations of the world.

There is no more need to fight amongst ourselves, they say. Autochthon brings men together in bondage; the Exalted can unite them in harmonious brotherhood. Three in particular make this known through their words and actions. Jet, the paragon of honesty to oneself, embodies a truth wholly different in substance than her allies, and yet embodies a truth nevertheless. Morgan, the champion of truth to others and to the public, strengthens the foundations of civilized society with every word he speaks. And Benford embodies a final truth: an understanding of the cosmos and the world in which men must live. No longer can eyes turn away from the damage that hands do. No longer may cowards flinch from the responsibility which is theirs. But once, men did - they only lacked the light to show them the way.

Still, this war cannot continue forever. The Exalted know what they must do. Each in his or her own way has a job. For her part, Jet has chosen to seek out the truth of the Wyld - to take a spiritual journey into the dream worlds beyond the Chaos Frontier, and by main force of will to wrest a great secret from the cosmos. She does not even know specifically what she will find - that is the nature of a vision quest. One goes in with questions, and one emerges with knowledge, but knowledge is not answers.

Carbon, experienced dreamer and shifter that he is, has told her much of what she needs to do.

---

The world she finds, as she walks through New York City, is one very ordinary to her. It's 1995, in a place where there have been no Alchemicals, no breakout of war with the Machine God. It seems peaceful. Carbon walks with her, both wearing the flesh of humankind.

Charity looks around slowly, walking with a curious expression and her usual, warm smile. "We hope not to find what we expect, but what we need," she intones.

"Your instincts should serve you in this," answers Carbon, eyeing a woman as he passes. "Predators hunt for food - any food will do."

"I think that kind of hunt is best taken in the Real," says Charity. She pauses to stare up at a towering building, reaching out a hand to touch the stone and steel of it. "A dream walks here, but is it mine?" She turns to her right and walks farther, gliding her fingertips along the building as she goes.

"If I understand aright, what we have here is.. everyone's dreams, mixed together." Carbon takes a deep breath, exhales, takes another, drinking in the air. "It smells right."

"Is it a one way street?" asks Charity. "Or are we modifying the dreams of the many as we move here?"

The Lunar shifter considers this. "The old man, that Sidereal.. he thinks the war for Gaia is being fought here in dreams, if I understand him right. So what happens here has to have some effect. But I don't know how to predict what it might have."

The feel of Charity's fingers on the building changes. She recognizes something else, some _significance_. The stone weighs heavy under its burden, but it calls to her in a faroff voice.

"Everything dreams, doesn't it?" murmurs Charity quietly. "I can hear the stone of this place calling from a great distance." She reaches out suddenly, taking hold of a passing woman by the wrist and pulling her near. "I wonder if all beings work the same way here." She looks at the one she has caught searchingly, hoping to hear that same voice, or perhaps one more clear.

"What do you want?" The woman asks irritably. Charity can smell fear and irritation, and watches curiously as the woman's eyes play out a pageant of emotion so vulgarly plain to a Lunar's senses. But there is nothing like what she just felt.

"Perhaps another time," answers Charity carelessly. She smiles warmly and releases the woman with a caress. She turns her attention back to the building, resting her hands on it and saying, "I wonder what it means."

"What what means?" Carbon asks, raising an eyebrow. He is clearly not as privy to the context as is his partner.

"Can you feel anything by touching this building?" asks Charity. "It was like its spirit was talking to me, weary and distant."

After a moment, Carbon shakes his head. "No. But that probably means that it was talking to _you_. And that means it has some significance to you. Find out what other sorts of things do the same, and we'll be on to something."

Charity nods and walks on, stopping to check when the mood strikes her. The next stop is a street light, which she clasps in her hands. "I will keep searching until I find more of these voices," she whispers softly.

The feeling is present at the ground level of tall buildings, and Charity notices that it becomes stronger further down. A few minutes of covert entry satisfies her that it's not simply the basement or something below the earth - it's the _foundations_.

"It is what all rests upon that is exhausted," says Charity quietly. She strokes the concrete below her like a lover, "Is that what I am to know? Is this the feeling of the Earth itself?"

The burden is heavy, but the bedrock and the stonework seem content. Charity manages to find the cornerstone of the building, receiving its eternal satisfaction with its lot. There is a tremor, just for a moment, and the Lunar experiences a brief and panicky reaction - from her own instincts - at the prospect that the whole structure might somehow collapse here, on top of her.

"This building has a spirit that is almost broken," says Charity. "Like it might collapse any moment." She closes her hands one over the other and lets out a deep sigh. "Do prayers work here, Carbon? Does this Wyld essence heed me?"

"It does. ... I think." Carbon pauses. "You can harm nothing by trying."

Charity smiles at her guide and lets her eyes slip shut. For a moment, she does nothing but stand there, motionless. Soft she begins to sing, letting her words shatter the silence and begin to cut through the noises around her. At first, it is possible for those moving past to ignore her, but more and more the raw attraction she exudes begins to gain attention, attention she directs with gestures to those around her. They are to join her song of thanksgiving.

The song picks up around Charity in a growing chorus. What starts with raw attraction is build up by the more scientific principles of social proof. In short, monkey see, monkey do. With singing now taking hold, Charity begins to dance, and the most gifted among her audience join her, while others of less skill, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, find their place in circles moving slowly about dancers.

The celebration expands like a spreading fire, and as it grows in power the effects can be felt and seen by the Lunars. To them, the dancers voices turn into streams of light, swirling out and around, before they dive towards Charity and find their focus, guiding this radiance at last to the foundation itself. Time here is a difficult thing to manage, and so Charity is not sure how many verses she has sung, or stanzas she has improvised in her prayer, but surely it is no less than a hundred before at last she draws it to a final state of highest energy and then gently weaves the performance back into the normal beat steps of the street and bustle of crowds.

_My child, you have seen my wisdom and begun to learn of it. Go next to the tree in the park, and learn from it._ It is the voice of the building, and it speaks to her and to no other. Around her, the performance begins to wind down, and people appreciatively throw some coins before getting on with their business, seemingly unfazed at what just transpired.

"Thank you wise one," replies Charity. "Should I return to the world of men I will remind them to give thanks to those who hold them so safely. You serve as a reminder of their potential. Their gratitude should be revealed." She bows deeply and turns away with a last embrace of the stone. "We are to go to the park," she explains to Carbon.

---

Central Park is a square mile at the heart of Manhattan. It is green, and beautiful, and natural-looking. Despite that, Charity is saddened by the signs of artificiality that her discerning eyes make out. The rest of the visitors here, perhaps, live happier in their ignorance. In time she finds a large and lively tree, whose branches grow wide and whose roots dig deep, and it whispers faintly to her in a far-off voice.

Here Charity reaches out her hands to the tree and her pity and sadness flow out in a series of airy sighs and murmurs. She senses the wrongness of this place, how men in their arrogance first slaughtered nature and then made a mockery of it, thinking themselves wise. Once more the Lunar's will pours from her, and those passing by are ensnared, for in the wordless sounds they can see what should be and know in their hearts the insult of what is.

The tree's voice grows stronger. Its only response to the secret offering of spirit is this: shelter from the sun. Air with which to breathe. Wood with which to build. It grows, and it grows, and in time it will pass away.

Charity replies to this sad notion with a sudden burst of hope. She shatters the notions of air, shelter, and wood. It is the whole of the tree, the beauty of its form, the grace of its limbs, the strength and resilience of its trunk. They have a value in themselves, not only in the use to which a man might put them.

_My child, you have learned something. Now learn this too: my purpose is only to live. That suffices for me. Seek wisdom now at the cafe._

Charity bows to the tree, "I understand. We must exist to the greatest extent, to pursue our being in whatever ways we might. Yet all this is only to live." She smiles warmly and embraces the tree before she makes her way towards her next stop. There are many cafes, and yet she never hesitates. "I begin to understand what you mean, my friend. It is better than I expected. I am learning answers to questions that I never even realized I had."

---

Sitting at a local coffee house, Carbon turns his drink over and over in his hand. "What does it mean?" he asks.

"I won't know yet," whispers Charity. She rests her hands on the table and draws in a deep breath. The place smells of warmth, of comfort. She can sense the hopes and worries about her. The young college students working on a project, the man in the corner focused almost pitifully on a report that he hopes will lead to a promotion at work, and the people behind the counter, smiling as they work.

The Minion - the chosen name of the Fair Folk who the Deliberative sent to help the Exalted understand this new Wyld phenomenon - takes a seat at the table next to the pair. "Charming. Delightful. Isn't it?" he asks with a smile.

"It is," replies Charity calmly. "I didn't expect to meet you here, but I cannot be entirely surprised. After all, this is your home more than my own. But I wonder, do all things dream? Do all dreams take form here in one way or another?"

"Oh yes," smiles the creature. "Everything is made up of dreams, you know. Everything, everything. That's what Essence is. You radiate Essence, which makes reality, and that reality resonates with its own Essence. New York? Paugh, merely concrete and piss. But the Big Apple?" His voice adopts a conspiratorial tone. "Now _there's_ a dream."

"Just like the house and the fence and the car," says Charity. "So my dreams are as real as anything else. And the dreams of my dreams can walk as well. What made you Minion? If you are a creature of dreams, how is it you can hold a form for a long time? Or is the Wyld not as wild as we are led to believe?"

"We dream shapes for ourselves when we venture into your tawdry frozen realms," the Minion smirks. "We depend on the Wyld to sustain us, of course, but.. here we are!" He takes a forkful of apple pie to his mouth; Charity is pretty sure he hadn't had any before.

"You could at least share," teases Charity. "Now, I must learn something new here, and I have a feeling it wasn't going to be something I conciously ask. If I only learn by the questions I ask I shall never grow wiser, or think in ways beyond my current ability." She looks at The Minion, "Do you know why I am here?"

"You are here on what the Lunars laughably call a vision quest," the Minion answers. Unexpectedly he draws a Beretta from a pocket and rests it lightly on the table as he speaks. "For example, all of these people here? Figments of some imagination. They aren't real." Jet can feel herself freezing, transfixed somehow by some influence or other the Minion has just put into motion. The fae creature casually draws a bead on a few of the coffee shop's denizens, pulls the trigger. Blood sprays and screams ring out through the air. "No more real than me, you see?" He grins, and puts the gun to his own head.

There's a brief bang, and the Minion is gone. The coffee shop is normal. Those killed are alive, unaware of anything that just happened. And another figure, beautiful and elegant and cold, sits down at their table. "I am the Second Minion," he says by way of introduction. "I apologize for that. Now, what can I do for you?"

"I'm not sure yet," says Charity. "Why is the terminology 'vision quest' laughable? Surely the Wyld is a place to have visions and learn. What do you find disagreeable?"

"Oh, that was him," the Second Minion shrugs. He seems bored with the entire matter. "I find them interesting. You see, nobody tells you the truth, ever. If they don't hold something back deliberately, then they still won't tell you everything because you CAN'T tell someone everything in just words." He hands over a Polaroid photograph. Charity recognizes the picture as Morgan. "For example, who is this?"

"This is Morgan, or at least the picture of him," says Charity. "I believe that this picture is actually a spirit itself, if my understanding is correct. But the man in this picture is a good friend of mine."

"Of course. Now.." The Second Minion toys with the photo a bit, flipping it about with graceful fingers. Charity notes the jeans and t-shirt in the photo, but can't recognize them. "If this really _was_ Morgan, you'd be able to tell me what was on the back of his shirt, wouldn't you."

"True," says Charity. "But it's only an image, a capture reflection." She looks around herself. "Is that how this is?"

"It's a perspective. When you receive something like this, you're denied any knowledge but what the perspective contained," the Second Minion explains. "In this case, what the photographer chose to capture. Words are another perspective - the speaker's, and only what he chooses to say. The Wyld is different. There _is no perspective here_. There is no identity. Only undifferentiated nodules of truth. Occasionally we claw our way out to the edges, turn around, look, and see what we can see. But you.. you're dipping in a finger from beyond it, feeling about, hoping to draw back with something helpful."

The coffee cup in Charity's hand vibrates silently. And she can feel it. It's just a cup, nothing more - shaped a certain way, and useful by virtue of its shape. Filled with coffee, it exists only to be drunk. But empty...

Charity realizes what she's here to find.

---

Three-legged war machines have begun erupting from the earth in parts of the eastern seaboard. Guided by the malign intent of the hostile protoform, they march on America's cities and citizens. And if the rogue scientist and his extraterrestrial ally had had time to prepare, they might have succeeded.

The Army mobilizes. The Navy's forces dispose themselves. The American government, conscious of what it's facing thanks to the research being done by the LI-13 team, understands the danger and is reacting appropriately. The President and the Secretary of State are working double shifts to reassure and inform the rest of the world.

This is not to be a desperate defense of all humanity. The magnitude of the affair is small and relatively localized. But how much worse could it have been?

Where the tripods go, death and destruction do indeed follow. But they are only machines, made of Earthly materials, subject to Earthly laws, and vulnerable to America's military might. What that might cannot do, however, is mobilize with the speed and precision which Scrapper and his friends have demonstrated.

With the UFO out of action, the fastest way to get around is the Paper Dragon. Phone lines aren't working, but there's plenty of radios to go around; Floyd filters reports from the Army, and Marcus' dragon is dispatched as a scout. The army has no problem dispatching a helicopter for everyone else, but has to stay low to the ground; true to form, the tripods' weapons are swatting uncautious aircraft out of the sky.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the invasion seems to be centered more or less where the team starts, somewhere off the Turnpike near Grover's Mill. So it takes no time at all to find the first of a seemingly infinite string of crises. On a nearby city street, a three-legged, fifty-foot death machine menacing a school bus that has gotten stuck in a sea of abandoned cars.

Colin looks at his companions. "Well, this is, at least, what I think being a hero should be." He says, more or less as-a-matter-of-factually. He smiles to his companions, and makes a break for the war machines, the tripods of death. He holds up his katana, walking as if on the air, and holding his own against one of the machines, as the children pile out of the school bus below him. He looks down, trying to fend off the attacks from the invader before he lets one slip, the bus smashing behind him as so much metal and glass. Luckinly the teacher is holding the last school child, and running off into the distance. Colin takes a little breather.

But there is a lot of ground to cover, Marcus has come to adjust one of his golems to serve as a fast strike craft, further aided by the masters of air. While the military mobilizes swiftly to address threats, it is those with links that work to minimize the pain and suffering and buy the armed forces time to respond. It is a very short time indeed before the work of the heroes is splashed across news, their exploits doing more than saving lives: they give hope to those who face danger every day.

Jason has always been less confrontational than Colin, less inclined to fight. Fortunately, while Colin engages the tripods directly, there is more than enough for himself and Marcus to do. Much of modern human technology, particularly automotive technology, is full of flammable liquids; left to themselves, they would have left nowhere for the schoolchildren to run. This is where Jason comes in; the skills which he used to fight fire in caves beneath West Virginia work just as well in an urban environment, and wherever Jason casts his gaze, fires subside and fade. This, too, gives Marcus more room to work - fire is anathema to the paper golems, after all.

With the bystanders out of the way, there's no need to hold back on throwing force around. There's plenty of gasoline, and nitrogen volatiles, synthesized from the air by Jason. But when it comes to a straight brawl, Scrapper lives up to his handle. He jumps down from the helicopter wearing jeans and a sweatshirt and runs towards the tripod. Iron and steel fragments leap from nearby cars, buildings, and even dumpsters, until Toby Lazarus is surrounded by a swirling, man-shaped cloud of metal. The tripod tries to kick him aside, but Scrapper catches its footpad and twists. The machine falls backwards like a surprised drunk, and the humanoid iron figure batters it with fists like wrecking balls.

With tripods raining pure hell down throughout the east coast, the group starts to put on many miles. Rest is hard to come by, and in short order everyone is getting very used to getting their sleep in brief naps inside a swiftly-moving paper dragon. Still, some attacks stand out, and when assaults spring up up in Boston and New York at almost the same time, the group is put to an even greater test.

Tripods rise out of Boston Harbor, shedding dark water and detritus from the seabed. The immediately march on Logan Airport. Military and local authorities are using it as a marshalling point for evacuation and a staging point for the response to the attack. With the operation in jeaporady, the team knows where to go.

Colin looks out. "Boston, eh?" He looks around himself, the waling death dealers bring terror and destruction, that only the linkers can mitigate. He glowers at one of the machines, his sword singing as he attempts to battle off the foe. His glance is at his companions. He was always the front line, making it safe for them to evacuate or otherwise mitigate the populace as he fends off the seemingly impenetrable death dealer.

While the evacuation is the focus of Marcus' paper dragon, helping Colin distract the enemy and hopefully gain him an opening to destroy the foe falls to the strange cat that the paper master brings along. It's claws allow it to easily race over the surface of the enemy, and though it cannot break through the defenses, it can distract and confuse.

Floyd trundles forward to engage another of the machines. His trenchcoat flaps behind him as he steadies the ultra-tech Grappler against his hip, the very picture of the Man in Black. When one of the tripods fires, he quickly picks up a discarded luggage trolley and interposes it between himself and the deadly blast. The flash fades, and he flips a different trigger; the now-molten cart flies away from him as if shot by a cannon, striking the attacking machine squarely on the nose. He raises his radio as the thing topples. "One more down."

Flares go off around yet another tripod, the light as well as the pressure waves confusing the device's sensors enough to allow Jason to weave through the air around it. They don't leave Jason enough resources to build up a death blow... but he is able to steer it toward a nearby retention pond. As it draws near to the water, Jason swoops beneath it, grabbing one of the legs - and with all his might, aided by the grip of nitrogen, he hauls it off solid ground and into the water. Suddenly caught off balance, the thing struggles to right itself - but this time, the distraction is enough for Jason to take those crucial extra seconds. A titanic bang goes off near its head - and hardened nitrogen turns it into a directed blast that knocks it off its feet.

Every kind of transport, from Greyhound buses to water taxis to tugboats, flees from Logan Airport as fast as their engines will run. The invaders were stalled by the arrival of LI-13; as if to take out their frustration, they turn from engaging the military to taking potshots at departing civillians. Some of the last to leave where from a field hospital, set up here to take pressure off the overwhelmed hospitals; two of the tripods now turn on their convoy as it rolls ponderously towards the freeway.

Off its duty as evacuation point, the titanic paper dragon throws itself at the enemy. It strikes the foremost tripod from the sky, ignoring its blows and slamming into it at full speed. The dragon heaves the first enemy above its head and throws it at the second. The impact is not enough to stop the foe, but it surely diverts attention. Standing near Floyd, Marcus stumbles from the strain of it, the older man leaning on the other for a moment. "I don't think I can do that again," Marcus admits.

"It's OK," Floyd replies. "You already gave it one hell of a papercut." He hoists the grappler and fires at the wounded tripod's legs. The machine isn't powerful enough to lift the attacker wholesale, but Floyd has gotten skilled at tripping them up. The machine slows, trips, loses its balance, and topples. The convoy is a mile away before it regains its footing. Marcus and Floyd have departed in the paper dragon, and the machine stomps around clumsily and impotently.

As the two tripods struggle to right themselves, Jason spirals between them. A peculiar atmospheric distortion follows around him as he flies, and his body seems to ripple, as if caught in a heat haze. Energy blasts stitch the air behind him, but this time he does not generate flak to confuse their tracking. He finally comes to a stop between them, and raises both hands in a rude gesture. One of the tripod's guns finally gets its bearing and fires - right _through_ Jason's image and striking the tripod behind Jason. The atmospheric distortion fades, and Jason can be clearly seen a few feet away. Grinning, he darts off before the tripod can gain another lock.

The cities of the northeast are never completely evacuated; among other things, where would everone evacuate to? But somehow, they manage. Away from the urban sprawl, refugees find islands of peace in gymnasiums, stadiums, even aircraft hangars. By the third day, nobody is running in terror from the machines. Word gets around - the war can be won. Then there's the rumors about paper dragons, men of iron, magic samurai, and super-soldiers... inevitably, people start making comparisons to comic book heroes. And that only makes it better...

On the morning of the third day, LI-13 is leading a search for survivors in a formerly sleepy district of Staten Island where a tripod appeared without warning. What earth-movers might do in hours, the team can do in a few minutes. In many cases, Scrapper can almost wave tangled metal out of his way, and it's handy to be able to re-oxygenate a trauma victim with a thought. Somehow, a news crew manages to sneak by friend and foe alike, and catch one dramatic rescue on camera...

---

Charity and Carbon watch the news. An unusual amount of activity has just broken out, and both Lunars know that something here is of interest to them. When they watch the superhuman heroics being broadcast live on the news, they know they've found what they were looking for. And they set out.
