# Junkyard Heroes 2009-10-31

The battle against the emergent alien tripods didn't last long, as such matters could have. In fact, Scrapper and his little band of vigilantes really dealt the decisive blow in the war, and did so before it ever began - they stopped the hostile protoform's full invasion plans, forced him to act more quickly than expected. And so in the end, the alien invasion wasn't one of overwhelming dominance. It was a defiant, spiteful gesture from a pre-empted conqueror. It was a very human invasion.

Vital repairs on a few buildings in downtown Trenton have been wrapped up. The group has come together to work on some of the urban devastation wrought by the tripods. The event comes without warning.

Marcus' dragon collapses abruptly - fortunately it was carrying nothing at the time. A shower of paper drifts on the wind where once stood a powerful creature. Similarly, the group themselves feel abruptly bereft of their new senses. Their awareness of the elements of the world is gone, severed at the source. This can mean only one thing: the battle has been decided, one way or another.

Colin looks over at Marcus as the feeling of control slips away. It is much like losing a good friend, or even a limb. He smiles, and cocks an eyebrow, "So. Who's it going to be?"

Marcus squeezes a hand shut and watches the paper fly away uselessly in the wind. With a sigh-perhaps of relief, perhaps of regreat-he turns to Colin and grins. "That's a fine question. I'm rather terrified to even think of it, but in a way, it seems that is perhaps the most important thing we were chosen for, isn't it?"

Jason scratches his head. "Tough question. Who among us is pure of heart, that they may draw the sword from the stone?"

Floyd taps the control panel on the Grappler. Not even a beep. He sighs and drops the inert device. "Might be better if it's nobody. I'm inclined to bury the thing on the dark side of the Moon and leave it there until better beings than us dig it up."

"Buried things are found," says Marcus gently. "Dare we take that chance? Every choice has great risks."

Colin blinks, "Stay Puft Marshmellow man. Isn't any choice we make going to turn out wrong?"

Jason laughs at the incongruity. "Not really, Colin. We already know what _can_ happen. Toby looked... and we got us. Finch looked, and we got an alien invasion. It _does_ make a difference."

"The only wrong choice is to do nothing," Floyd quips. "So let's get over to the grounded UFO and make sure the cordon is intact. I know some places we can hide it, if we have to. And if Mother Theresa shows up in the meantime, we'll consider letting her through."

Colin ponders for a second, "I wonder if Toby would get Aura again.... " He lets this thought hang out there, it does present many many questions.

"I think he would get something a little different," says Marcus. "He's changed. I think knowing what happens even changes it. But it's all a guess."

Colin says, "Perhaps. I almost feel like we owe it to Toby to let him take Aura home... " He looks around the ship that Toby has created. "We do owe him a lot."

---

The UFO is intact. Its duty as a temporary shelter has been discharged; the police have been on hand to keep people from poking into the innards. Now it's hollow, and empty, and dark. The secured area where the protoform has been stored still has its police tape over it.

Toby has been tinkering uselessly with the systems. He's been mopey and quiet, and most of his energy has gone into repairs or modifications to the UFO's secondary systems. He waves listlessly as the group approaches. "I felt it too," he says.

"You didn't look at it," Floyd says softly. It's a statement; there's no signs the crypt has been disturbed. More importantly, he knows Toby. "We're trying to decide... if anyone should. Or if we try to hide it."

Colin looks down at his feet,a nd at his companions. He doesn't want to be the first to say anything.

"Why do you get to decide?" Toby asks. "Mr. Floyd, who gets to decide that? Ah? Who?"

"If we can hide it," says Marcus. "Without our gifts moving this thing may prove a lot harder than it used to be. Now that most of us are just civilians again."

Colin looks back at Toby, "Who does get to decide, then?" He shrugs, the poitn coming out a bit more fiercely than he really meant it.

"Who _does_ get to decide, indeed?" says Jason. "We're the men on the spot. We have no _right_ to be the ones to decide... but we _have_ to be, even if only by inaction. If we don't decide ourselves, we've decided to leave it to the vagaries of fate."

"And the will of the state," says Marcus.

"Fine." Toby shrugs. "So then. What is your decision?"

Floyd finds somewhere to sit - a bucket seat out of some huge old Chrysler. "That I can answer. It has to be us. One thing that worries me... if this is the end of the crisis, then it will be back to 'business as usual' in Washington." He hooks a thumb over his shoulder. "I'm a good soldier, but I don't want the Pentagon to get ... it." He almost said 'her'.

The UFO is mostly cleared out. A couple of police officers are drinking coffee outside. It's just the group - and a pair of loitering alley cats, who presumably have also had the good sense not to peek behind the screen.

"We have a little time," says Marcus. "We're the only ones who know what is happening, right? I think it is meant to be our decision. This is likely to be our last great act as heroes, you might say."

Colin looks over at Marcus, "Yes. It might be. And a lot of me thinks that it shouldn't...."

"OK," Floyd says. "Then let's move quickly. First question: does anyone here want it? I will say right now that I don't."

Colin shakes his head...

Marcus stares down at the floor, "I think we're all a little scared of it, honestly. Who wouldn't be?"

"Looking at it while scared or sad? This does not seem wise, comrades," observes Toby.

Jason, for his part, is looking contemplatively at the back of the room. "I wonder..." He taps his chin. "Toby, you wanted to take her home. Maybe that's the best thing. If whoever looks at it does so with the intent of returning it to its homeworld..."

Colin arches an eyebrow at Toby, "You haven't said anything, boss..."

"... I'd need some time, comrades," the junk man says after a long moment. "Let me cheer up, okay?"

Marcus smiles at Toby, "My friend, I think you have it right. We can't use this thing if we aren't positive."

Jason leans on Floyd's chair. "There's just one problem," he says. "We know we aren't alone in the universe anymore. What if there are other invaders? We were helpless against Finch's protoform without Aura. We'd be just as helpless against anyone else wielding Links. And we may not be lucky enough to have the next one crash-land to be imprinted by humans."

"We've gone thousands of years without contact," Floyd says slowly. "Someone at LI-13 was talking about, what did he call it, Drake's Equation. We could probably go several thousand more..." He shakes his head. "Whoever 'imprints' next is going to be humanity's ambassador out there. I'm willing to leave it in their hands. And if anything does land closer to home..." Floyd grins for the first time since the 'war' began. "Well. That's a job for us, right?"

Colin looks over at Floyd, "So, I was never clear on Aura's 'mission' while she was here anyway. I know other people had an easier time, but I found talkign to her like unraveling the gordian knot. I got the impression that whatever she is wasn't intended to be friendly."

"She read us a prepared statement from the aliens that came with her," Floyd mentions. "It was pretty grim. But that was them, not her."

"Aura was a good woman," says Marcus. "The rest are details. Important, but not as important as who she was to us."

---

Toby has gone out for awhile. He returns in good cheer with a woman dressed in a nurse's uniform. "Comrades, I have elected to take the Pepsi challenge facing us," he explains. "And I ask that you all respect the manner in which I have done so."

He turns, gesturing at the woman. "This is Nurse Edith McKinstry, she is one of the rescue workers who have been saving lives here." Nurse McKinstry bobs her head briefly. "Hi, it's nice to meet you all."

Marcus is somehow surprised, and not. "Well, as long as have a nurse to help us along the way we should be just fine, right?" He stands up and offers a hand, "Nice to meet you Nurse McKinstry." He handles all the introductions and asks, "So, what happens now?"

Toby himself resumes. "Yes, the brief battles here have still left a few loosened ends. And I have decided that what is most important is that for nobody to be selfish in their wishes. And I have thought about what Aura meant to us. I have asked around and found the unfortunate test pilot for this program." The nurse steps outside the UFO a moment. She returns pushing a baby carriage. "This is Lisa. A newborn. Now an orphan," Toby explains.

"Do you understand my intending, comrades?"

Colin nods at Toby.

Floyd frowns. "Call me a dumb flatfoot, but... no."

"I have a guess, but I'm not sure what the outcome would be," says Marcus. "Are you suggesting we have a baby do this?"

Toby nods. "A baby will not wish the death of the world. A baby wishes for only this: the perfect mother."

Jason nods. "As long as she doesn't wish us into the cornfield..."

Colin nods at Marcus, "I suppose we can put the world's poets to the test on the innocence of a child, in any case."

"Rather too aware of original sin for that one, Colin," admits Marcus. "It's certainly an interesting idea. I've just always heard that it takes a while for a child to even realize that other people have thoughts and feelings. Still, there's something to be said for this angle."

The nurse is instructed in what to do: the cart will be pushed into the enclosure and withdrawn, perhaps 20 minutes later if nothing happens. Toby assures the nurse that nothing will happen to the child - which is true enough as far as he understands the issue. In fact, nobody is really certain what will happen.

In due course, Nurse McKinstry follows her instructions. She carefully pushes the cart to the opening, then gently eases it in the rest of the way without looking inside. Baby Lisa is cooing and inspecting her own chubby thumbs all the way in.

In a few moments the cooing stops. There's a gurgling noise, and then after a few moments, a squeal of delight and baby laughter.

A minute passes. The carriage gently rolls out, minus the baby.

Floyd murmurs, "OK, that could go either way. In any case, your country thanks you for your service. Especially you, Toby."

Soft footsteps follow it. There is a woman, made entirely out of a material with a metallic gleam and a pinkish hue to it. She is beautiful enough; similar in some ways to Aura, but also different. She could be Schala's older sister, and she's walking. In her arms, Lisa is snuggled up.

Colin looks up at the proto-mommy, and then at Lisa, then back at proto-mommy. "Er...."

Jason smiles and waves. "Hello, ma'am. Who are you?"

"I am Eve," the woman answers, smiling down at her child. "I remember all of you. And I love you all." She looks up, and her eyes meet those of her audience.

"It's a pleasure to meet you again, Eve," says Marcus. He looks around at his friends, "So what now?"

Jason smiles. "So... we won, then? Or rather... all of humanity won." He breathes a sigh of relief, as if only just now realizing he'd been holding his breath.

"I remember why I am here," Eve says, looking now especially at Toby. "I know whose child I am." She raises a hand, careful not to dislodge Lisa, and gestures. A flickering light comes into existence there, an array of crystal and shine that spins slowly in place. "Here. The coordinates to my homeworld, the place of my birth." She squeezes slowly; the crystal disintegrates into powder, drifting to the ground.

"Our kind are sent into the universe as children. We're meant to find other lifeforms, to become new things. Our parents wish us to experience everything there is in the cosmos. I was kidnapped. I was sent here by creatures who wished to use me in their plans for your planet. I became.. separated."

Eve smiles. "And so I've become what my parents wished for me. There's no need to take me home. My friends, I am home."

"Do we have to worry about these creatures?" Jason asks.

"They expected a signal back from any planets that the ship had found," Eve explains. "No signal means that they think I'm still in flight - or lost. No, they won't come here."

Floyd says, "Then... the crisis is passed."

"So our job is done, then?" asks Marcus. Inside, he can't help but a feel a little bit of a let-down. It's hard for a day job to compete with being a super hero.

"There is still more to do," Eve explains. "Now that we're together, I can link to flesh, the way the invader did. And to begin with, some unfinished business..."

She stretches out her free hand, gesturing at the air, and makes a tugging sensation. Two humanoid figures are literally pulled into reality, similar to the gold bug and other things the group has seen. As their features become clearer, they become recognizable: the two soldiers who were slain by the invader protoform.

"What was done can be undone. And what has already been taken can be used," proclaims Eve. The pattern of her body begins to shift and waver. Where there was once metal, there is now living flesh. A living woman stands nude before you, cradling a child - now her child - warmly against her.

"Toby Lazarus, you really are an idiot," says Eve in a chiding voice. "You spent all this time in my mind, and I in yours, and you thought you could hide feelings from me." Toby's blush springs immediately to his cheeks, though he need not face away - he already is.

Colin stands just about speechless. He looks around,a nd collapses into a nearby chair.

Jason stares just a little too long, before blushing and looking away himself. "Uh, does anyone have a blanket? Or a, a, a towel or something?" he stutters. Though he does try to keep his voice down. This is Toby's moment, after all.

Marcus' eyes are about as wide as they can go. He whispers, "Truly the cosmos is more vast than we might ever come to comprehend.. and I am grateful to only be a very small part of it, so that I can experience wonder at the turn of every leaf."

"Love is everywhere in the universe," says Eve with a smile. "Love is the most important thing. The only real thing." And as the UFO's systems begin to come alive around them, she looks at Toby. "Shall we go for a flight?"

"Ave mater sancti," Floyd intones, by way of reply. He motions to the others. "Let's give them some time to work it out. You guys can help me make some phone calls... starting with the White House."

---

Eve's words have a profound effect on one of her listeners. Not any of the mortals gathered here, but on Charity - currently lurking about in a strange iron craft along with Carbon, disguised as an inoffensive and unremarkable alley cat.

The vision quest has concluded. She _knows_ the message is the truth she sought. And here in the Wyld, a realization dawns. She knows one of the Fetiches of Autochthon, and she knows the inexorable trap that lays around it.

Charity remembers her visit to Old Autochthonia, before the transformation. She remembers the message she received: that Autochthon loved his guests and wanted the best for them.

She remembers the new Autochthon, so curiously devoid of empathy that humans are a mystery to his own creations. She remembers the Alchemical Exalted - the catalysts for change - who were sent out into the world to study and learn. And she remembers one who was sent to learn about love.

But how would that lesson be conveyed? She remembers Engel, so intent on resurrecting the Ivanova sisters. And why? Because upon his death, his inspiration and memories - everything that made him Engel - would return to Autochthon. Would be reincorporated into the Song. Would become part of a new generation of Alchemicals.

How is it that Autochthon can be defeated? No, not defeated - turned away from his dominant nature, turned toward a being that will let humanity alone. How? Love. And how will love become a part of him again?

The trap is simple. How do you kill someone you love, even if their death is necessary?

And if you don't love him, killing him achieves nothing.

Where there was a cat, now stands a woman with a distressed expression. "The path that lays ahead is clear," she says gently. "I must give him back to the one who gave him to me. There seems to be no choice, is there my friend?"

Carbon regains his accustomed form as well and shrugs. "What will you do?" he asks.

"I have to kill someone I love," says Charity. "Or the world is probably going to pay a horrible price." She smiles suddely, "On the other hand, this proves a point. We don't have to defeat Autochthon, we have to win him over. Shame on me for not realizing that something like this could be possible."

Charity reaches out to put a hand on Carbon's shoulder, "You have made it clear to me that being what we are brings with it a burden of responsibility. Being what Cam is does the same. I will tell him what I have learned, and we will see what we will see." She leads her friend away from this place, "I think it is time to go. This world shall continue in what way it might." She sneaks a look at the departing heroes, "They did well. They did very well."

---

Cam listens carefully as Charity explains her story. The inexorable logic of his death doesn't seem to faze him very much. In fact, as her unhappy reasoning draws to a close, he's actually humming and smiling.

Charity isn't so great by the end. Though she bears the mantle of responsibility, she doesn't do so without tears and sadness. "So.. what now?" she asks gently. She sees a tear land on the back of her hand lifts her head to meet Cam's eyes. "I'm sorry, Cam."

"It means we've both arrived at our destiny," says Cam with a big smile. "It means something else. You know... not just that my purpose is at an end, that I've achieved what I was built to do, but that achieving it is still acting out of love. It's beautiful. It's.. it's really sort of magical."

"For God so loved the world," says Charity quietly. "If he will surrender his own son, it seems I must also surrender my brother." She reaches out to take his hands in her own. "I hated you at first. Do you remember?" She laughs through her tears. "I hope you can forgive me that."

"Already did," smiles Cam. "Oh, I have two messages for you."

"The first is a prerecorded message from Autochthon, embedded in me when I was rebuilt. It says simply 'thank you'."

Cam leans close, and begins humming in Charity's ear. It's the same thing he was humming before. It's a simple song, familiar-sounding, and the Lunar recalls it clearly enough that she could continue it. "That's the other."

"Thank you Cam," replies the Lunar. "I have a message for Autochthon, as well. Tell him to please remember love." She forces herself to smile, "I wish you could stay, Cam. I understand that it's not the way of things. True love is not jealous." She doesn't want to talk about how this is going to be done. She can't even think of it.

Cam rises purposefully, still smiling. He leads Charity by the hand away from the family, walking some distance. He settles at last on a quiet place and turns to his sister. His humming comes gently, and in it the Lunar finds solace.

The last words ever spoken between the two cut through Charity like a knife. "I love you. Truly you were a brother to me. You taught me more than I taught you." He smiles and waves, "Farewell, sister."

Cam's passing is swift. There are worse pains than death, and Charity knows how to kill. When she sees that he is indeed gone, she stands there weeping for some time, until finally she whispers, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." She looks to the horizon, where the moon has just risen. After she has buried her brother she sets a stone to mark the spot. On it she etches his name and a message, "In learning to love, he has taught us all. Thank you, Cam. We love you."
