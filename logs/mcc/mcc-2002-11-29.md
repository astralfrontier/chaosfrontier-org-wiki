# Millennium City Chronicles 2002-11-29

"... And the test is Friday. Study hard." Professor Carver announces, before waving a single hand. "Have a good day." The air erupts in the rustling of bags, the squeak of seats rising as students flee from the theatre-style classroom. This test in Chemistry should be cake. No calculators allowed, but what of a rather sharp, math-intensive mind? But, the day's classes are nearly over. In two hours, a lab on Metallurgy. But for now, a paticular meeting is nagging one student. A date for lunch in a quaint little Chinese resturant; Chris just loves Sesami chicken.

Tom shoulders his coat, waves to friends and classmates on their way by, and spends a moment mentally reviewing his schedule. _Two hours - lunch, one hour - transit time - budget. All on the green._ A cheerful smile decorates his features and he strolls confidently out of the classroom, and threads his way through the building. Time to get into town.

Millenium City U is in the south-eastern side of the city, not far from the South Gate, and a lane leads from the campus right into The Loop. In fact, a Monerail station isn't but a brief jog off campus. Thomas slips his token into the slot, before waking through the turnstile, which catches somewhat. Amazing how some of the most sophisticated technology is inherit in the city, but they can't fix the turnstiles. Tom settles into a window seat, the train looking about to go. The doors are about to close, before a young gentleman with long bangs steps in, the doors halting. "What's the hold up?" He announces to no one in paticular. "The train is being held by someone in the doorway," A computerized voice announces. The man steps out of the doors. "Well start up." The doors close. "The train is now safe to go." This is generally a standard prosedure to almost embarress whoever's holding the doors open, but a few passangers snicker in amusement at the gentleman's apparent game with the system.

Youthful emotion gets the better of him for a moment and Tom lets out an exasperated sigh. _This is what's so nice about science and electronics.. a circuit board might malfunction, but it never just decides to screw your schedule up.._ He spends a moment appraising the rider, then settles back in his seat and lets his eyes wander over the cityscape beyond the window.

The gentleman walks into the back, singing "These boots were made for walking" under his breath. The rail comes to life, and heads down the track. The sprawl of Southern Detroit, a collaborations of small businesses, tight packed lower middle class neighborhoods, a few parks, and such sweep by in the window. The rail heads around, before going towards the Downtown MC station. Outside the station, walkways spiderweb to nearby buildings. A glance over the edge of the high-rise station, one would spot down on the street, it would seem some street performer is putting on a show.

Thomas goes down a level, before heading through a walkway. The wind breezes past one of the cut-out sides of the walkway. Painting one of the walls to the half-inclosed platform is a bulletin board for Ishel Cologne, the slogan "Even if you don't control magnitism, you'll be sure to attract, with Ishel". The walkway attaches to a building with a small playground on its top. From there a walkway leads to an office building. Down on street level, Thomas isn't far; just one block and to the right. Passing the kiosk, a conflaguration snacks and information. The screen to the News blares on about some security system business, before flicking to the weather. Some people are crowded around what looks like a car wreck on one side of the intersection, but thankfully, due to the chips, no cars are in sight, avoiding the potential jam.

Blinking at the wreckage, Tom circles 'round the crowd - he seeks a quiet place, an angle where his sense of perception can roam into the vehicle's interior without being blocked by the presence of so many people. Perhaps a few interruptions in a schedule are worthwhile after all..

"You cut me off!" "I had the right of way; you barrelled right into me!" The initial search of the vehicles proves nothing outstanding, except for the damage to the cars. A truck rammed itself into the right side behind the passenger's window. The older gentleman in the passanger's seat, looks tired and shaken, but otherwise he seems fine. The owner of the car, a well-to-do looking fellow isn't as arguementative as the truck driver, but an MCPD police officer arrives shortly on the scene. A second starts clearing everyone out. "Nothing to see, after their pissing contest is over."

Tom spends a few moments scanning and recollecting the faces of those at the accident - a habit, born of curiosity and a recognition of the usefulness of any information in the right circumstances. With that he smiles in relief, continuing on to his appointed lunch-date.

And down the street he goes. The Crescent Star, a decent resturant as they come, is the meeting. The waiter inside asks for how many, before Tom informs him that a table is waiting. And then he spots Chris. A nice, comfortable booth, as always. She's rifling through a few notes on the table, pushing a dark bang behind an ear.

The student walks forward, waving jauntily and - as is his recent custom - reviewing quickly the last few conversations he's had with Chris. Always good to spot the danger signs early, and be prepared. "Hihi," he calls out casually. "What's new in news?"

She looks up, and smiles warmly. "Tom!" She sets the papers aside, before reaching forward to playfully poke the man in the stomach lightly. "Oh, you know, being Arlene's retriever." She lifts up some photographs, "Kivetik had a run in with some gang members roughing up some poor guy near a park. Apparently, someone had a camera... Arlene tracked him down, and sent me after some photos." She rolls her eyes. "How's classes, honey?"

Tom smiles, settling back into the booth. "Classes are good. I could tell you all about self-organizing systems and Prigogine's Nobel prize for discovering them, but that hasn't been news for twenty years.." He regards Chris across the table curiously. "I've got about an hour, if we eat fast.. mind if I tag along?"

A waitress arrives, and questions for drinks. At this time of day, The Crescent Star has a buffet, and well stocked, too. Plates gotten, Chris talking between bites, "Mm, sure, why not? I could give you a better tour of my cramped little closet they call a cubical." That beaming smile... which is marred a touch with some soy sauce.

"I think there's a stain on your journalistic integrity," remarks Tom with a smile, reaching out to snag a napkin with which to clean. "See, you have GOT to get a better job there. Gotta be something a woman of your talents can do besides run errands.."

She giggles goodnaturedly, and finishes the wiping off of her mouth. The waitress arrives to refill drinks. "Well, Arlene seems relatively pleased with my work so far. She hinted that the next thing that gets shuffled onto her plate, she'll let me tackle." In other words, the next assignment that Arlene doesn't feel like doing, she can write off as 'educational experience', and stuff it into her assistant's workload.

Tom raises his eyebrows curiously. "Hey, if your name is on the byline, it's all good." He wolfs down a few more bites of rice and washes it down with water, smiling. "Speaking of education, tonight's good if you need study-buddy help, tomorrow night got reshuffled." Ah, the joys and perils of an unpredictable graveyard shift.

Chris nods her head. "Good. I'm going to have to start working on a resource project for my tuesday night class, anyways." She takes a bite of some steamed potatos. "Oh! Tom, could you please please please pick up a cake for me tomorrow? Jenna's birthday is tomorrow afternoon, and we're going to throw her a little office party around three. So if you could get it around noon? It's at that little bakery off Renaissance Plaza."

He nods once; "Sure thing. I'll be sure to swing by and drop it off after I get it." He files it away - _TODO, tomorrow._ Cake, bakery, something appropriate. More flashing thoughts, and a smile. "You know, that's just typical. The journalism major wants to present something fancy to everyone, but it's the criminal justice major who's dig up something appropriate." And he laughs, lightly and sociably. A cake is the least favor she could ask, a simple matter.

Chris once more offers that warm smile. She would be more appropriate in television news, but she is taking what she can get currently. The waitress refills the glasses, before returning for used plates. "I think we compliment one another very well, Tommy," She teases. "Do you want to do anything this weekend?"

Tom plants an elbow on the table and supports his chin on one curled fist, doing a passable imitation of 'The Thinker'. "Good question. It would be fun to get out - buuuut.." More consideration. "Sure. Walkways from noon to sunset. I'll bring my books, we can get some studying done, and get to do it in some nice scenery."

Chris nods her head, seeming elated. She goes up to retrieve her favorite dessert. The Crescent Star makes some delicious little cheesecakes, wrapped in doilies, like cupcakes. Chris, despite her work at home with all the jazzersizing, still splurges. A serious sweet-tooth is her vice. She returns, "That sounds great. I'm just about ready to go."

Tom rises from the booth and fishes through his pockets for appropriate remuneration. "You watch those things," he warns with a goofy grin, "or I'll have to chase you all over town to keep you fit!"

She laughs in return, and swats playfully at his side. "Like you could catch me! Hmph." The waitress arrives, with a full pitcher. "More drink?" She looks at Tom's standing form. "Or ticket?"

The youth nods curtly. "Ticket's fine, thanks." He deposits a brief bit of green appreciation for service, then moves to cover the check. Even in this day and age, chivalry isn't dead yet.

Even if Chris likes to pull her own weight, or go Dutch with some situations. The fortune cookies fortell Chris to have her achievement's pathway but a stone's throw away. Yet Tom's informs that Family is the root of all. The trip to the paper is brief; one reason why Chris likes the resturant so is for it's close proximity to the Paper, the Millenium City Chronicle. She leads Tom up to the third floor. "Chris!" "Jenna!" Chris hugs a late twenties woman. "Oh, and who is this darling?" "That's my man." "Oh, Chrissy, look at him. He's just dashing."

Tom waves and smiles politely, cautious of his distance in the face of flattery. He's learned about Chris's own photographic memory, the one that records his reactions to other women, and conducts himself accordingly. "Pleased to meet you." The usual air of apprehension about handshakes abounds in his perception, and he's careful to keep himself at least somewhat behind Chris.

Jenna grins, "Well, Chrissy, I've got to jet. Ol' Mr. Kent is berzerking if he doesn't get his headline. The putz. I'm off!" She hurries past towards the elevator, tweaking someone's ear as she passes. Chris just shakes her head, before marching off to her cubicle. "Well... this is it!" A computer, a desk, a clip board on one 'wall', a picture of her sister, or of the chihauha 'Baxter' - who is all bouncy when Tom is around - and so on.

Tom chuckles softly. "'From such small roots does greatness spring'," he quotes helpfully, then casts his eyes around. "And you've got the essentials - brains, brass, and the reliable support of your coworkers and boss." His eyes drift to the clipboard, studying it for a brief but sufficient instant, and continue their casual sweep of the meager environment.

"Oh! I need to drop these pictures off with Arlene." She digs in her bag, finding the folder, and walks off. Slow, of course, as if expecting Tom to sidle by.

She adds over her shoulder, "And you forgot the collective resources of my boyfriend."

Tom catches up obediently enough. "Well, true, you're smart, ambitious, and I can't fault your taste in men," he teases.

She just snickers. Arlene's office is organized clutter, verging on the colloge of an obssesser. The walls of her office seem to be half scoop-decorated, half covered in leads. Pictures, articles, letters, all assorted with the theme of Supers, or by rough association; various business accidents, high profile thefts or destructions. Everything seems to be a place to set something, even if it all comes off as organized, and not messy haphazardness. Seated at an 'L' shaped desk, is Arlene Raymond. Blonde hair is pulled back into a braided ponytail, the bangs tied back, though likely would have been kept at bay by her glasses. She looks up from reading something. "Chris, hey. Did you get my pictures?" "Right here," She says, at first holding them to her stomach, before handing them over. "Oh, hello. You're... Tom right?" Arlene asks, peering over at Thomas.

Hanging, all collected together, are several very good - and bad - pictures of the Ghost Knight, with a few stray articles hanging like a beard beneath them.

Tom nods, affably enough. "Good afternoon," he greets, politely, and leaves it at that. What little he's heard suggests someone who doesn't like to waste time, and with that in mind he leaves any further pleasantries in the journalist's hands. His eyes drift through the piles and clippings, in mute admiration of tenacity.

Arlene shifts through the pictures, looking at each one like a shark eyeing some wounded seal. "Even for someone who wears a mask, he really can't pick the good ones, either." A shake of her head. "All right. I've allready spoken to two other eye-witnesses, and also got some commentary from one of the thugs he threw though a fence. Even if it was an old, decrepit fence, the mugger isn't very happy. Nermal said he had some letter from someone snipping at me. Could you run down and snatch it? I want to be prepared to water that arguement down in the next column." "You want me to bring the others that he's likely collected since last you talked?" A firm smirk. "As always."

The younger Temple listens to the exchange, admiring its well-oiled precision. Understanding between employer and intern seems complete; only his own alter-ego's face, plastered on the wall, reminds Tom of the role this woman servces in the city.

Chris offers a smile to Tom, before easing out of the room. Tom would likely follow, but something catches his eye. A picture. It looks rather recent, in fact. The old gentlemen in the car wreck, his features painted into the picture, seeming to be speaking to someone Tom recognizes, but only by name. Enaro Sannis. A member of the New Purple Gang. The two seem to be having lunch at an out-door cafe. Of course, this is in the back ground of something; a picture of some hero he isn't exactly familiar with, speaking to some boy scouts at a street corner.

Tom excuses himself to the restroom, once outside the woman's office, and sneaks away. Once safely emplaced in a stall, his eyes close and the lessons of meditative focus make themselves useful. His mind now clear, that peculiar and nameless sense which fate has entrusted in him roams free of physical confines. It searches, out and up and about, seeking the office he so recently left, and its contents..

Tom steps out of the bathroom, briefly checks himself over, and threads his way back to Chris's cubicle. He's humming merrily.

Chris arrives shortly, looking sheepish. "Work work work! It's all I do." She leans forward to squeeze Tom around the chest. "What are you so merry about, hm?"

Tom chuckles softly and returns the quick hug. "Just an observation of the workings of fate. Hey, you want me to meet you here when you get done today? We can hit the books a little early?" Early enough to give him some free time to follow up, naturally.

She grins a little. "You just want to finish early so we can find some free time afterwards. Predictable." She taps your nose. "Sure. You have a class coming up soon, and I know you like to be all prepared and punctual."

"Say rather that every moment without you is a heartbreak," he replies, trying hard to balance jest and sap - the right combination of "just kidding" and white knight is hard to find, but sometimes he manages it.

She wrinkles her nose cutely, likely tasting the sourness that is the sap, before rewarding the attempt with a kiss on the nose. "Get, you."

Saluting smartly, the young knight dashes off and sends up a last jaunty wave before he exits the office level. Once outside, his face is composed into a more somber mask, though he remains smiling. "Tonight, car insurance. Tomorrow night can wait," he muses half-aloud before making his way back into the teeming heart of the city.
