# Millennium City Chronicles 2002-12-20

DarkGlow laughs shortly, belatedly attempting to inject a bit of mirth into the sound. "I assure you, this day has earned me no profit. You might even say that winning this battle and protecting the inno-- victims of this metal beast was that to which I have dedicated my life today." _Looks like the Skull doesn't know me. Wonder why he showed up...? Do my bosses know about him? Or the girl, for that matter?_

Sirens are now blazing, and now the media looks to be getting closer. One camera man runs across a walkway off to the side, while two reporters and their equipment men run onto the scene from the far left. Two men from the FoxMecha buliding walk briskly out toward 'CAT'.

The dead-headed vigilante nods curtly, already walking with deliberate strides towards the downed aerial hero Tengu - or perhaps his last resting place. Gloved fingers flick out; in response, chunks of the broken kiosk dislodge themselves and fall to the sides.

DarkGlow addresses the female fighter. "This may seem an awkward question, but I don't suppose you know what happened the man speaking at the podium? I'm afraid I... misplaced him in that gas attack."

A fist encased in black metal emerges from the kiosk debris, then the figure of Tengu sits up slowly, and begins getting to its feet, chunks of wood and paper falling away from him like water as he stands.

At first, the reporters and their crew begin to circle the dead 'CAT' like a pack of vultures, much to the annoyance of the scientists playing in the wreckage.

"Umm.. no?" Vanessa replies with a sheepish grin. "I sort of.. wasn't paying attention to him. Had other.. fish to fry as it were."

The vigilante appraises Tengu coolly; finally he speaks in that dry, dead voice again. **The machine was stopped. Those two--** the skull jerks back, indicating Darkglow and Vanessa **\-- are mostly responsible.**

Looking at the robotic corpse, DarkGlow nods. "Yeah. It _was_ a bit distracting, now that you mention it." He blinks at the woman's blurred figure. "Either I caught a blow to the head that I don't remember or I'm needing new glasses. I can't seem to properly focus on you--which is a shame, I'm sure."

Tengu speaks with an emotionless electronic voice to the skull headed vigilante, "I see. I owe them, as well as you, thanks, on behalf of my employer."

The figure turns on one booted heel and walks towards his fellow-fighters, shaking its head. **Police soon,** it announces. **Those of you who wish to avoid questioning are advised to leave.**

Tengu strides up behind the skull headed being, "Before you do, I have been authorized to give you all something."

_Here it comes..._ DarkGlow thinks, perhaps a touch eagerly. _Is this what they sent me for?_

Vanessa turns to leave but stops up short when she hears the electronic voice. She turns, smiling brightly. It sounded like a present. She liked presents.

The Ghost, too, turns. Blank eyesockets narrow curiously. _A trap, a bugging device..._ Though cautious, it waits.

A small port opens in the chest of the Tengu armor, the size of an ATM reader, and three cards eject from from it, "Take these. They are from Mister Yamaguchi." The cards are plucked from the port and proffered to each of the would-be heroes here. They look like ordinary business cards.

As if on que, the reporters and their equipment start to hurry toward the four along the side of the street. "Hey! Would you give us an interview?" It seems they had warning of the police too, because MCPD police begin to flood into the scene.

A simple phone-number covers the card. "Please make the phone call tomorrow, at three o'clock." Then the bird-like Tengu turns, and takes wing into the air.

Vanessa glances down at the card in her hand and sighs. And here she was hoping for something shiny. A bit of paper with writing on it wasn't very exciting. But.. still, it's intriguing.

The Ghost Knight peers at the card again, curiously, then stores it in a most discomforting way - by pushing it sideways against his chest, into which it disappears without sound, incident or disruption. **Be discreet,** it cautions, then sinks into the ground.

Just as the police begin to charge toward the group, some shouting at Tengu to halt his flight, the reporters make it first, wielding microphones. They gape a moment as the grim hero melts into the earth, before turning their attention on Vanessa and Darkglow. "Could you tell us what happened here? In your own words?"

Shadows race to obscure DarkGlow's face as he glances at reporter. His voice is cold as he gestures to the FoxMedia men near the CAT. "It was their beast which ran amock. Speak to them about the lives they endangered." Supressing a snicker, he turns and strides away quickly, towards the back stage area. His black cloak merges with the shadows and then he is gone.

Vanessa doesn't reply to the reporters as she watches the skull-headed man disappear. That was just.. creepy. Shuddering, she backs away from the crowd and begins to walk away.

The camera pans out after Darkglow, the journalist looking aggravated that his potential scoops are melting into the very environment around him. The camera and mike turn to Vanessa. "Hey, Wait!"

"You can get your statement later," A gruff cop barks, before following after Vanessa. "Hey, you, stop!"

A second wave of reporters arrive, even if the police are trying to hedge them out. Some are swarming over the remains of CAT, speaking to the three men by the remains of the robot.

Several paramedics run onto the scene, and immediately hurry over to the downed crowd from the robot's assault.

Vanessa is briefly questioned by the police, but she makes a quick exit when the cop started barking at a reporter trying to eavesdrop on their exchange. Soon, the Plaza is a churning place of chaos in the curious onlookers and those looking to restore order to the once peaceful square. Vanessa, finding a good place to dispel her blurring effect, hurries back to her car in the garage not far down the block. The road before it is a little trafficed, but it shouldn't take more then ten minutes to get on the way home. She finds her car, and Becka, waiting anxiously. "Vana!" She cries.

"Sorry it too me so long, kiddo," Vanessa apologies with a rueful grin. "It's crazy out there.. all the people running around in a panic. But.. I think we can make it. You ready to go?"

She nods, and sighs exasperatedly, before opening the car door. "Well, don't do that. I was worried." She crawls into the front seat. "Okay, so, next time we stay home and eat."

Chuckling softly, Vanessa gets into the car as well and slams the door shut. "I hate to tell you I told you so but.. I told you so," she winks. "Dinner at home is always better than dinner out."

Meanwhile, Thomas finds his cake by the store, the edge of it stomped, but the cake undamaged. Thanking those lucky stars, he starts the trek toward the Millenium City Chronicle.

Thomas makes every effort to hurry it up, mindful that scant minutes of his "flex time" are left, and with due diligence arrives with time to spare for Jenna's office party.

Up to the third floor, where Chris's office is. "Tom!" The girl belts out as she spots the cake-baring youth. She rushes over, to squeeze his waist. "I'm so glad you're okay! I heard on the news about the attack there, and I was worried you might've gotten hurt. Details are all sketchy..."

"Hurt? Nah," Tom replies with bravado, carefully hoisting his prize to avoid harm from incoming affection. "I walked out of the store, saw a rumble going on, and hightailed it. How could I let myself get hurt and be late for this, hmm?"

She laughs happily, and leans back to poke him in the stomach. "Well, you were late, but circumstances got in your way." A warm smile, before she claims the cake. "You got it safely! I'll be right back, I'm going to the breakroom."

Thomas loiters around, smiling and considering. While waiting, he reviews for himself the people involved in the situation he so recently escaped from, playing the events back in his mind and considering carefully.

It would seem this floor is all a-buzz. Chris comes back, just as Arlene comes through the door. "Chris," She calls, "I need you to get on the wire ASAP. I just got confirmation on my cellphone that the Ghost Knight was identified at the scene, as well as some incognito Supers. I'm heading down there now; can't even take a lunchbreak around here." Chris nods, but looks a little dissapointed. "Are you not going to make it for Jenna's party?" Arlene winces, and looks at her watch, before staring off to space. "I'll see if I can make it back in time. If not, send her my happy birthday wishes." WIth that, Arlene dives towards her office.

Thomas tries very hard to resist smiling, laughing or even grinning at the thought of a top-drawer newshawk rushing past her very quarry. Instead, he stays well away from the door, and waits patiently to be useful to the party guests.

Chris just shrugs, and walks back over to Thomas, smiling a little. "Would you like to come by for the party? It's going to be at three, but I don't remember if you have a class at that time or not..."

Thomas shakes his head. "There's nothing else I need to be around for," he remarks obliquely. "I'd be happy to attend the party.."

She nods her head. "Right, thanks honey! Now, gotta go, on the clock." She kisses him on the nose, before hurring toward her little cell of a cubical.

"...Criminal Apprehension Tank, eh?" Someone comments on a phone near Thomas.

Thomas perks up, his ears already sharpening attentively to the sound. This must be what they fought.

"Mmhm. Donno what happened. Complete accident. Right, right. So the guy working on the thing is Trent Prescot, then? Okay, got it. Uh uh. Yeah. John Bronski. Gotcha."

Thomas listens, engraving what he can into the vaults of his recollection. _Always good to know what sort of heavy armor people are working on.. someday it may get used against me._

The phone is hung up, and the balding man behind the desk starts writing a note.

Thomas idly moves closer, curious now.

Arlene then comes peeling out of her office, a much more servicable coat, a packed briefcase, and everything needed for the job. She looks as determined as a shark, and atleast one intern pauses in approaching for a question, as she passes.

Thomas gets out of the way too, cautious of his demeanor near this woman.

"Eddy," The balding man - Thomas thinks he recalls Chris calling him Butters as some office nickname - calls towards the intern. "Run this down to Beverly." Eddy nods, and claims the written paper. "Okay." He sets his stuff on some desk, before heading to the stairwell.

Thomas saunters towards the cubicle, leaning up against one wall lightly. "Hey.. I couldn't help but hearing. The Tank thing.. I actually saw a bit of it. Can you tell me anything about it?"

Butters looks up. "Huh? Oh, yeah. Apparently, it's some new thing FoxMecha has been working on to aid SWAT teams and large problems like that; busts in, offers cover and disabling power, for SWAT and police to move in. They were going to have a live test of it today, at two. It apparently got up and walked off."

Following this is a snort. "You'd think they'd keep a leash on their toys, huh?"

Thomas chuckles softly. "I saw it hit somebody in the air.. I'd say the live test was successful."

Butters chuckles. "Yep. Though, I hear some costumed police-wannabes jumped in and blew it up, so it ain't so perfect."

Thomas blinks in apparent surprise. "Huh, imagine that," he remarks casually, smiling. _Nevermind that I could probably hand him a rough draft of the blueprints.._

Nodding the shiny head, "Okay, so, what else'd you see?" After a second, "Say, you're Chris's beau, aren't you?"

Thomas nods quickly. "Yeah, that's right. Uh.. didn't see too much, except some guy flying around with wings, who got hammered.. Looked pretty scary, though."

Butters hms. "Ah well. Arlene will probably rip into the witnesses, so we can pick her findings out. No doubt her commentary is going to be slanted." A rueful chuckle.

"Well there were plenty of witnesses," remarks the young man with a grin. "That crazy tank was shooting at them. Wonder what'll happen to FoxMecha's prestige now? They'll have to do SOMETHING to avoid going into the PR toilet."

"Yeah. They're probably going to need to packpeddle harshly. I bet they'll likely donate some of their technology to Cumberland Hospital again, or maybe the other one." A dismissive gesture. "Time they go back to the drawing board, too."

"And time I got to the party," Tom grins. "Hey, good luck on your story."

And somewhere in an apartment bathed in darkness, a pale, thin figure alternatively lifts weights and snaps kicks and punches at emtpy air in the ritualistic manner of his martial art, until finally he sags to the ground exhausted. His skin rapidly chills from the sheen of sweat covering him. _A robot,_ he thinks, meditatively. _From FoxMecha Tech. And Mr. Lydon. From FoxMecha Tech. I haven't a clue what's going on, and that's dangerous. I may not be setting up anyone for an early grave this time, but I still need to put in my research time..._ Standing, he quickly showers.

Cleaned and refreshed, he powers up his computer terminal. Its soft glow shines over the room, complemented by a quartet of widely-spaced candles, the room's only other illumination. Swiftly, he begins typing.

"XXX- Naked pictures of Brittany Spears, Jennifer Lopez, the Scarlet Samuri! Just click here." Darkglow and everyone else wants to kill the inventor of pop-ups. A google search of Lydon earns a little biography, an article within the last year or so describing the death of his father, head of the Yamaguchi corporation in a plane crash. Lydon then became the head of the corporation. Lydon, himself worked in gravitic propulsion and contra-gravity technology, making several breakthroughs after heading the Nuclear research in the corp's R&D office, before his father's death.

_And gave the tech to the guy in the flying suit. 'My employer', indeed. Yamaguchi--right, I remember him going on about that. Guess if Lydon isn't FoxMecha, neither is flying suit._ DarkGlow concludes.

FoxMecha is the next search. DarkGlow is greeted with the logo of a silver fox's tail underlining the FMT, and a robotic-looking canine skull perched above them. FoxMecha Tech is obviously, and after reading confirmed, a robotics, bionics, and cybernetics corporation. Their enterprise goes from cybernetic reconstruction for handicapped individuals to sophisticated tools for law enforcement. The most recent news regards FoxMecha Tech having deals with the Greymalkin Corporation regarding certain joint-projects.

_Cybernetic reconstruction, huh? Gee... I wonder if that's anything like the new hardware so generously donated to me... Some military stuff, but not much. Damn private companies always keep their lips shut tight--no mention of that 'CAT' thing on any of the public boards. I'll look at this Greymalkin Corp. later--that's enough for now I think. I'll hit the sack and get up bright and early. Think 2AM should do nicely for a bit of prowling practice._ DarkGlow grins at the thought.
