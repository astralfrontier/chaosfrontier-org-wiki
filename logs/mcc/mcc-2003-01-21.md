# Millennium City Chronicles 2003-01-21

The next day comes. It comes like any other day, but for three individuals, ticks to the telling hour of 3 o'clock. The day had been full of news on the CAT attack on the plaza, and briefly the super-individuals were mentioned, of course. Clocks strike 2:59. Decision time comes.

On a randomly-chosen street corner, at a randomly-chosen payphone, a college student with a backpack is dialing a number etched into a card held up with two fingers for inspection.

In her kitchen, sitting at the kitchen table, a young woman with a kid sister glances at the card, glances at the clock, then looks down at the phone in her hand.

A seemingly older fellow with white hair tied neatly back into a ponytail stands staring oddly at an abused-looking payphone. Dark sunglasses and a black raincoat like old-time detectives once (supposedly) wore make him seem a bit out of place, but standing just inside an shadowed alley as he is, rarely anyone pays him more than a glance. Muttering, "Let's get this farce over with," he steps out onto the sidewalk and reaches into a pocket for change.

Three calls go into place. Two rings later, a pick-up. There is a brief pause, before a voice greets over those three phones. "Hello. I assume you all are the ones who delt with the robot, yesterday?"

"Yes." The voice isn't the dead echo the Ghost has used before, but it's deliberately sanitized of inflection. He waits, then, to see how this plays out - surely this Tengu must want something..

DarkGlow scowls at the unoffensive numberpad. "I assisted, but I can only speak for myself. "

"Yes," the woman's voice was soft and rather hesitant as if she wasn't sure she should be calling.

"Good. If you all came to the fore yesterday, you no doubt have allready decided that Millenium City is a dangerous place, and you've taken the call to some duty. Despite several others like yourselves in the city... more help is always better. I have an offer for you."

"I wouldn't call it duty," Tom's pseudo-voice responds. "I, at least, am listening."

_'Call to duty'?_ DarkGlow has to resist an impulse to stare incredulously at the receiver. _I'm falling in with 'good guys'. God help me._ He makes his voice as flat as he can. "As am I."

There's silence on the end of the third line, but not a dial tone. So someone else was still listening as well.

The words sound just a little rehearsed, like they had perhaps been practiced in a mirror just before. "Right. You met Tengu yesterday, and during the fight, he got himself hurt. It's obvious that he isn't going to be able to deal with the things in this city, atleast alone. He works for me; I'm Lydon Yamaguchi. What I am proposing is to sponser you three. I can offer you some training, resources, and some equipment along the way. Obviously, Tengu is a little limited, but I'm guessing that the three of you are pretty diverse in your talents, so it would better the cause to get you all working together."

Thomas perks up at this. He doubts training or equipment will come in that handy, but an industrialist of Yamaguchi's caliber might just be the thing.. "Keep talking," his synthetic voice responds.

"And which cause would that be, exactly?" DarkGlow asks, sharply.

"...sponsor?" the woman asks quietly? "What sort of sponsorship are you talking about? Or are you just talkinga bout the training and equipment and such.."

Lydon seems to ingnore the tone. "This city has a few heros. The Champions, for instance. But they're... pretty much a city-wide defense. Someone planning on destroying the city? They're on it. But people like them miss the little things. That's what I'm trying to stop; the little things. This isn't a perfect city, and you have the capability to fix it." After a pause for the woman's voice, "That depends. I don't think you want to work on your PR, but I can certainly help in other areas. What happens if one of you goes to jail? You're going to need a lawyer."

He adds, "And no doubt someones' going to get hurt. I'll cover the medical bills."

Thomas checks his watch idly, thoughts of telephone taps and their limits occupying the periphery of his mind. "I suggest we meet to discuss this," he offers.

"... All right. I want to avoid sending those 'black cars' to pick you up, so why don't we meet somewhere else? There is a playground on the top of the Toys-R-Us building, a few blocks southwest of the Reneissance Plaza. How about we meet there in two hours?"

He says, "Two hours? That sounds..." _Let's see... Stupid? Boring? Pointless?_ He suppresses a sigh. "Good," he finishes.

5pm. Dinner time. Traffic jams. Lots of people. "5pm would be fine," the woman replies.

"Well," Lydon offers, "We could wait until dark, but if we do that, I would prefer we not be suspicious? As in not coming in gleaming skull mask and blurry vision."

"It's only suspicious if we're seen," DarkGlow points out. He smirks at that.

"What's underneath the skull is considerably less pretty," the voice responds shortly, and Tom hangs up. Talk of black cars has got his nerves twitchy, and he sets off at his best 'casual tourist' pace away from the phone.

"Ah... well, I guess that's that. See you then. Thank you both for calling."

"Yes, thank you," comes the woman's courteous and distracted response and then she, too, hangs up.

DarkGlow replies, "I'll be there." _Even if it's the middle of the day in a damned playground. This'll be a first..._ He replaces the receiver.

The anointed time comes. The sun is just starting to ease its' way down the horizon, setting the sky a nice peachy orange. The streets aren't as clotted, but they still are busy. The playground is pretty empty, except for a man of oriental heritage, sitting on a bench, a simple cane leans against the bench's side.

Out of the ground at one corner of the playground's boundary a black shape rises, surmounted by a white skull. Without preamble it begins striding towards the gentleman at ease, stopping several feet away and waiting expectantly.

Lydon cocks a brow at the Reaper. "You know, I was hoping for low key. But, what'm I going to do?" Tapping his fingers. "Now, where's the others..."

The woman arrives next, dressed in a long jacket and oversized hat. She had tried to look rather inconspicuous but, when standing next to someone with a gleaming skull.. a person would stand out regardless. "Well there goes -my- attempt at blending in," she mutters, making her way over towards the bench.

Lydon offers Vanessa a little grin of appreciation, even if it does have a rueful aspect of it. "That's two..."

One instant the space beside a plastic tube-slide is empty, the next a black robed-and-hooded figure strides out of the tube's shadow.

The woman sighs in exasperation. "I shouldn't have even bothered.."

A hint of unpleasant odor can be sensed as the Ghost Knight cracks open some seals at the back of the skull - or helmet, rather. It comes free, exposing what can only be described as the head of a corpse. Thinning grey hair, blue skin with black spots in places, hanging down here and there, and scaled, sightless eyes can be seen for a moment. Then the skull is replaced just as quickly and sealed shut. **Ths is low-key for me,** explains the vigilante. **Talk.**

A pale face with colourless eyes smile out from under the hood at the 'apparition'. "Impressive," DarkGlow comments. "Maybe I should try something like that."

"I guess we should make this brief," Lydon says. "While I understand your attempt at secrecy, I also don't want to get any pictures of me talking to you openly. The tabloids are like hyenas." Then Lydon trails off, just... gaping at the appearance of the Ghost Knight's appearance. "Ah... Right. Listen. I realize that you are using your abilities to deal with the problems in the city; else why would have you delt with the robot yesterday? But doing it alone isn't easy. Working together will help your goals. And I'll help you keep on track. Like I said; someone gets hurt, gets arrested, needs to take a trip out of town, if you need repairs, training, backup, I can get it. Maybe pull strings to get information, or pull weight to get things taken out of the papers."

"Umm.. no offense?" the woman says as she wrinkles up her nose. "But.. eww. I think we all appreciate the skull mask thing. A lot." She pauses, glancing at Lydon. "Training, medical bills, and backup are all well and good. But can you help with little sister's who are going to be wondering just where their big sister is spending all of her time? And why she's in the hospital.."

"What is your sister going to say if she ends up in a building hit by an explosive projectile from some suped up nut job in a hyperactive suit?" He levels eyes on the woman.

DarkGlow says, "I think a health package is a bit late for our skeletal friend here. But teamwork, as we've seen, can be very effective. There's a lot less of a chance of getting killed -- or even _needing_ a full fledged hospital -- with others to watch our asses."

"She'll probably scream a lot in agony and possibly die," the woman sighs loudly. "My point is the benefits that you mentioned are all well and good, and appreciated I assure you, but... oh nevermind."

"Exactly." Lydon levels his gaze on the Ghost Knight. "I did a little checking on you. You apparently have no qualms with going after corruption, where-ever you see it. Be it low, or high. Now, what would you say if I could help you get ahold of some of those individuals?" Glancing back to Vanessa, "I know. It's hard to explain. But unless you plan on sitting on your abilities and doing nothing with them..."

**The point is this - people like us can stop the \`nut jobs' before such incidents occur,** remarks the Ghost. **You must choose whether to sacrifice a little of your own family security for the security of many, many other families.**

++Note to self: Reverse those.

DarkGlow eyes the others. _Perhaps this could be amusing after all. For a while, until I figure out what the hell is really going on._ "Tell her the truth," he tells the woman. "Or tell her you're taking a karate class. Or tell her nothing and just sit on your hands and your pretty powers."

Lydon looks back and forth. "I figure I might as well come clean, myself. My father was a good philanthrapist, and he instilled a lot of that into me, to make me work for what I have, and do good with what I recieve. After he died, there was a stipulation that I used a good portion of the inheritance to better the city." A slight crooked smile. "I'm hoping that what I'm doing right now will do more then a rec center for troubled teens."

DarkGlow looks at Lydon with a coldness that rapidly vanishes. "It'd almost have to," he states.

After a few moments, the Ghost nods. **I'll join your effort.**

DarkGlow's response earns a confused expression from Lydon. Of course, he turns back to Vanessa questioningly. "Where do you stand?"

"Between a rock and a hard place, really," Vanessa sighs. "On one hand, I have to live with my sister and it's lies and lack of attention that -make- troubled teens, and she's troubled enough already, for said rec center. On the other hand, if I don't help try and make this town a better place, she won't live long enough to become untroubled either. But.. it would probably be best if I do help out. In the long run.. at least.."

Lydon smiles a little. "Thanks. I understand... Tengu's pilot faces a little of the same trouble, and its' his Job." He looks between the three. "So, is that it, then?"

**Reaching us if needed. And us reaching you,** the Ghost half-asks.

Lydon nods. "Well, I was seeing if everyone was on board, first." He reaches into his pocket, and draws out three cards. "This is my cell phone number, and my home number. I'll keep the cell on at all times. Being able to reach you three would equally be good. Second would be atleast making sure you all have what you need. Namely, at the least, a costume." He smirks. "Some things are traditional, and seeing how much you all wish for secrecy..."

DarkGlow rubs his eyes, vainly trying to massage away the deep, dull ache buried in them. He is suddenly tired, but when he lowers his arms and looks at Lydon, only shadowy blackness peers from under the hood. "I've got the costume covered, thank you, but I guess I should pick up a cell as well."

**I've kept up on the times since the Crusades,** comments the Ghost, then withdraws Tengu's original card from out of his very costume. He waves a gloved hand over it for a few moments, then presents it. **Broadcast on this radio frequency. If I'm .. animate.. I'll hear you.**

Lydon claims the card, and regards it curiously. "A corpse that recieves radio transmission... All right. Does this mean I need to pick up a walkie talkie?"

The Crusades? Well, the guy was a corpse. Or sure smelled like it. "A cell phone? Yeah.. I have one. It's supposedly for emergencies and.. well.. I guess this sort of counts. In a roundabout way." She searches through her pockets and finds a scrap of paper. "Anyone got a pen?"

**I'm sure it won't set you back that much,** comments the Ghost Knight drily. **Sprint turned me down for bad credit.**

DarkGlow glances at him. "I can see it. After all, what kind of job is a dead guy gonna get?"

Lydon just stares at the Ghost Knight, before chuckling. "This is going to be... an interesting experience." He hands Vanessa a pen. "What about you, do you need a costume?" He questions her.

Vanessa takes the pen and jots down her number on the scrap of paper before handing both back to Lydon. "Yeah, probably. And a nifty name as well. Though having a costume that's not spandex would be a good thing.. it rides up."

"Right. If you'd like, I can get ahold of a tailor and send them by your place. On short notice, I can only get ahold of a bullet proof vest, which I can get implimented into the costume, if you want? Later, we can work on body armor and the like, but this opportunity just jumped out, so I wasn't exactly prepared..."

DarkGlow opens his robe briefly to show her a black leather tunic and matching pants. "I'd recommed leather for decent and durable clothing. I hear it's also fashionable," he adds, but his voice is dubious. "Um, did you say 'bulletproof'?"

**Leave crafting armor to me,** offers the Ghost Knight. **Secure your kevlar or whatever you wish to use, Mr. Yamaguchi, and I will fashion a suit to specifications.**

"I'm a big fan of bullet proof vests," she quips. "Well, it sounds good anyway. I'm all for not being shot at all but, you know.."

Lydon simply nods to the corpse, before gesturing to Vanessa. "There you go. Though, I don't know how fashion-savvy he is, so you may need to inform him what you want."

The trench-coated, black-clad figure with a dead skull for a face only peers critically at the industrialist.

DarkGlow looks thoughtful. "Does kevlar come in matte black? And how well can you move in it?"

The corporate man tries to look innocent to the empty sockets. "Right. Well, then the first order of business for you three is to dig around and see what you can see about that little attack yesterday."

**I've already spoken to Lane Ortabon,** replies the Ghost. **He'll cooperate. A malfunction seems indicated.**

Lydon simply raises an eyebrow, but doesn't comment. He looks to DarkGlow. "Give me a call tomorrow, and I'll tell you where I'll have a cell phone dropped off."

DarkGlow smiles humourlessly. "I think I can afford one of my own -- those pay-as-you-go ones are quite cheap." _And safely anonymous..._ "Thanks, though. I'll let you know the number."

The tycoon nods his head. "Right. Okay. You have your homework. I think that's all we need, then?"

**Since we are now expected to cooperate, I suppose we should determine how best to investigate the attack?** inquires the Ghost, sounding a little less .. distant, more accessible.

Taking up his cane, and wincing as he stands up, the tycoon makes it onto his feet. "I'll leave you three to your work. If you need anything, give me a ring." He then starts to move towards the walkway.

"So.. about costuming, are we going to go with some sort of theme here.. or just whatever strikes our fancy?" Vanessa asks and then sighs. Sure, they would wanna talk business first. "Well, not to sound hopelessly naive, but did the newspapers have anything remotely worthwhile to say? At least to give ideas for places to start."

DarkGlow glances at Lydon as he walks away then turns to Ghost Night and shrugs. "Either it was a malfunction or it was sabotage. If it was a malf, no harm no foul. Sabotage, on the other hand, requires access."

**Sabotage is probably the easiest angle to investigate, and the only one that merits any investigation on our part, so.. I suggest we do that. I will have no difficulty inspecting the remains of the machine, and I suspect you won't either,** he comments to DarkGlow, then turns to Vanessa. **Your powers are unclear; however you want to proceed, I will support you. We'll work on a costume when Mr. Yamaguchi is ready.**

DarkGlow says, "I'll tag along on the inspection tour, but while I may know something about electronics, I never got around to building super-robots when I was a kid."

"Well, I could either go with you guys and get in the way or.. try to do some snooping around on my own," Vanessa shrugs. "I might be helpful if I go with you. At least as a sentry, maybe, if you guys are.. doing the breaking and entering thing. But somehow I think I'd just be in the way."

**If you wish to pursue another avenue, please do. If you wish to come along you can be useful in several ways,** replies the vigilante.

'As cannon fodder' she thought. "I'll go with you, then," Vanessa decides. "It might give me more information in which to snoop. Or ideas on where to start."

The Ghost Knight continues. **Trent Prescot and John Bronski were closely involved in the project. So was a third man, Lane Ortabon, who I've already... spoken with. Investigating Prescot and Bronski, and FoxMecha in particular for any corporate or personal rivalries, would be useful.**

DarkGlow says, "I read they're working with Greymalkin Corporation, but I haven't looked up Greymalkin, yet. Since you seem to be the best informed on FoxMecha, where exactly should we be heading?"

The three wait a good while, not exactly planning on storming the FoxMecha building. However, before an hour's up, Vanessa recieves a ring on her cellphone. Lydon works fast, apparently. Some decent materials, and a kevlar vest have been left in a locker in one of the Monnerail stations. The key is taped under a sink in the womens' bathroom.

Vanessa glances at the phone in her hand at the end of her phone call with something akin to shock. "Well that was quick."

The vest and other things are acquired, and Vanessa (at least) spends the better part of an hour watching idea become reality as the black-clad stalker's obscure power over the physical world crafts the vest to her every specification, no matter how exacting. Color, or lack of it, is added where desired; coverage is assured by the vigilante's own expertise, as it becomes clear he wears a variant of this type of armor himself.

The final result is donned and Vanessa models it for them, pleased with the results. "See? And they said superheroes had to wear spandex. They.. were wrong."

As nine o'clock rolls around, the three move into Renesiannce plaza. It would seem that they have begun working on the gaping hole in the buildings' front; construction material has allready been set out, ladders, even a canvas covering the hole.

"I'll go have a look around the entrance, if you want," DarkGlow offers.

**Check the front, then,** replies GK, I'll get Van in through a back door. There's an elevator system, and some stairs - I suggest the stairs, if you intend to continue entering the building.

"The stairs..." DarkGlow says, as if unfamilar with the word. "Right... Where are we meeting?"

"Fair enough, I'll go up the stairs.. where am I going to meet you?" Van asks.

**We'll meet on the second floor in about five minutes, then?** suggests the Ghost. **I'll take Van - we'll see you there, and proceed to the laboratory.**

DarkGlow nods. "All right."

Vanessa waits patiently behind GK since he evidentally knew the layout of the building.

The Ghost Knight leads off, walking quietly through the evening air toward an emergency side-door. He pauses periodically, as though waiting for something, then moves ahead again. Coming to the door at last, he simply steps through it and vanishes without a trace. A few moments later, the door is quietly and slowly pushed open for Vanessa to follow.

The isolated lights of nighttime cast many shadows. DarkGlow walks into one and doesn't appear to walk out again. Cloaked, he cautiously approaches the front of the building, alert for any cameras or other electronic sentries. _They armed their pet with IR sight -- just hope they didn't gift all their electric eyes as well._ Nearer the front door, he concentrates, seeking interior shadows suitable to teleport into.

Likewise bedecked in her new costume, Vanessa follows closely behind Ghost Knight, her gaze also picking up on the cameras and other surveillance equipment positioned .

Darkglow finds a shadow inside, and slips into the front room. He steps from a shadow, unseen. The shadow is thrown by a desk light from the apparent 'secretary's desk, which now has a security guard. Upon stepping from the blackness, his shoe catches on a bit of glass from the door. It breaks. The guard sits up.

DarkGlow steels himself. He flicks a bit of shadow against the guard's face, the side away from himself, lightly, like a child's breath or a spider's delicate stepping.

Vanessa and the Ghost Knight, meanwhile, move in through the emergency door easily. The alarm system which would have went off is silent, the cameras almost seeming to avoid the approach of the undead hero and his follower. They find the stairs, soon enough.

Without waiting for the guard's reaction, DarkGlow begins locking onto another other shadow somewhere above him, on the floor he actually wants to be on.

Shadows are sensed upwards. They are less strong - lights not being in bloom upstairs - but they are presently still there. While he's searching, the guard stands up, looking worried as he sees something move across his field of vision. His hand drops to his belt.

DarkGlow wishes him well on his fruitless search. He vanishes into shadow once more.

Darkglow forms out of the gloom filtering in from a window upstairs, light splashing in from the street lamps outside. The hall is empty.

The door to the stairwell stirs soundlessly, emerging forth is the Ghost Knight and his accomplis. DarkGlow spots them, but they don't see the shadow-drenched individual.

The Ghost Knight stands motionless, pausing and waiting again..

Vanessa manages to barely keep herself from running into his back.

**We're safe, you can show yourself,** the dead voice comments.

DarkGlow smiles to himself. "As you wish." He steps forward, visible to his compatriots.

Having silently watched one of the technicians return to his office, the phantom vigilante leads the crew up the stairwell three more flights. He pauses a moment, sensing the presence of two people, but they are seperated by a few offices. He does know Ortabon is in his own office area.

Thomas silently gestures at DarkGlow, indicating as best he can the location of Lane's office and the area around it. A gloved finger is put to fleshless teeth, a request for discretion.

DarkGlow shrugs, and sends his senses in that direction.

Cloaking himself in shadows again, DarkGlow steps into blackness and appears elsewhere.

Meanwhile, the vigilante meditates patiently, extending his own senses through the building to locate the CAT itself.

Darkglow slips into the shadows, and devulges outward. He's standing in a thirty by twenty foot room filled with six computers and other machinery. One has many wires running into a motherboard set on a table. A youngish looking man wearing a button down half untucked into some slacks is quickly punching away on a keyboard.

DarkGlow raises a hand wrapped in a razor-thin sheathing of shadow, but just gazes at it curiously for a moment. _Perhaps not tonight..._ The blackness unwraps itself and flies towards the unsuspecting man, entangling his limbs so he can neither move nor speak.

The amorphous blob of shadow envelopes the technician, who struggles in his chair, writhing around. He's certainly trying to make some noise.

DarkGlow quickly looks around for any visible cameras.

There doesn't seem to be any cameras in the room. Lane continues to struggle, trying to stand up out of the chair.

Meanwhile, after some serious work, the Ghost Knight makes note of where the CAT is. Two floors down, in a large area, the machine rests in two pieces. He notes there's atleast three gaps in his senses; people.

DarkGlow steps from the shadows, visible but face obscured. He turns the stuggling tech towards himself, and wags a finger gently. Whispering just loudly engouh to be heard, he comments off-handedly, "I don't have to let oxygen through your bonds, you know. I'd suggest you keep quiet and very still."

The technician regards him with both a baleful glare and a moderately nervous look. But he doesn't do anything else, doing as told.

It feels odd to be curteous to a man in the technician's position, but DarkGlow whispers, "Thank you." anyway. He moves to the darkened spot where he emerged into the room and vanishes again.

**Congratulations, there is now a witness,** observes the Ghost drily as the shadows resolve themselves into a man again. **The machine is downstairs. This time, let me.. I believe I can glean some information without revealing myself.**

Beckoning with a gloved hand, the Ghost Knight moves ahead towards Lane's office, now realizing what is needed - and what might be a convenient approach.

DarkGlow supresses a sigh and follows Skull face.

Vanessa tugs on GK's sleeve and then points to the outside part of the door. She'd wait outside.

**Lane Ortabon,** the dead voice sounds again. Then more quietly, aside to his companion, **That restraint isn't necessary.** He notes Van's brief gesture, nods in agreement, then returns his attention to Lane. **We're here to check your tank for sabotage. If you want our help, call those three men in the bay away on something so we can examine it.**

DarkGlow extends an arm and the shadows wrapping Lane return to him.

Ortabon looks more relieved as he sees the Ghost Knight, but doesn't do anything until he's unbound. He points at Darkglow. "Is he with you?" He asks with as much venom as a cobra.

**He's more aggressive than I,** is all the deadhead offers in reply. **You won't be inconvenienced further. Do you agree to help?**

"Fine." He says while grabbing a stapler. "I'll do what you ask, and while I am," Lane pops it open and tosses it to DarkGlow, who catches it reflexively. "Shove that up your ass and clench a few times." He then turns towards the phone.

DarkGlow emits a low growling noise as he drops the stapler. "And I was being _nice_..." he spits. The area between DarkGlow and the tech darkens dangerously as shadows rapidly gather.

Turning to the phone, he types in the code down to the lab. After a ring, "Hey-"

Ortabon lurches a little, backing up reflexively as the shadows converge, and slams his knee into the desk. He lets loose a swear. "Ow, fuck. Fuck. I think I did something to my leg. Macheski's a medic, right? Bring him along. Ow, motherfucker, ow." He hangs up the phone, and jerks his head over. "Please, fuck up the equipment with information I have for you on it. Just go ahead and bust it, too, why don't you?"

DarkGlow's face twitches invisibly behind a layer of shadow. "If you push, I push _back_."

**Some discretion, please,** the Ghost's cold voice cautions DarkGlow, before he turns back to Lane. **If you have information, please share.** To make his point, he deliberately steps into the space between the technician and DarkGlow.

"Yeah, I toss you a stapler, you shove me through the desk. Way to show your maturity from the playground." Lane's attention shifts to Ghost Knight. "He needs to work on his people skills. I'll give it to you later; they're coming up here. You better get moving."
