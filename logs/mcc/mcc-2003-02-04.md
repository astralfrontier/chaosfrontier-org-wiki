# Millennium City Chronicles 2003-02-04

Making quickness their jobs, the three move out and to the stairs, moving quickly, while the Ghost Knight parlays that the three are heading into the elevators. After some moving, they arrive in the lab area. Large, with lots of termenals and equipment. In the center, on two different tables, are the remnants of the CAT, it's waterlogged guts torn out.

The Ghost lets out an unearthly chuckle at the remains of the robot. **This won't be easy. Do you know anything about software?**

DarkGlow eyes him. "That's a nice voice modulator you got there. But, no, I've never had much interest in the software side of things."

Vanessa looks behind her, back the way they'd came. "I don't know it at all, but maybe that guy you pushed around did?"

Walking up and tweaking the saw-blades, DarkGlow continues, "Hardware, on the other hand... 'Course I've never much been into robots." He looks over at Ghost Knight. "That's not to say I can't learn." He grins.

**A shame.** The voice sounds from one corner of the room, well away from the vigilante. **I can see every deformity of the machine, and I am familiar with its blueprints. Investigate what you can and will.** The Ghost moves closer to the CAT, turning at Van's statement. **We'll ask once his visitors leave.**

The woman nods, and moves over to the machines. "Well, then, we should hurry, if they may come back." She starts inspecting the terminals, looking through files briefly. After a moment, "What exactly are we looking for?"

**Signs of deliberate sabotage,** replies the Ghost. **Obscured defects, unusual parts, last-minute changes...** The figure stands still before the CAT, rapt in contemplation of something.

The Ghost Knight observes the machine, its' insides and outs. It would seem they disected the interior wiring, and new, firmer rivots have been replaced, and it even seems they've been testing the armor, a few areas look like they've been more fortified. The Knight's unfurling of the armor obviously insulted the creaters.

DarkGlow purses his lips as he examines the robot. _Feel like I'm in the middle of an exam I forgot to study for. Pity time's already ticking out..._ He bends closer to the exposed guts and tries to make his accumulated knowledge of security systems and electronics fit the tangle before him. _Chips and wires and circuit boards, oh my!_ he thinks sourly. _This is useless. But maybe..._ He looks around the shop. _The techs will know what's going on. Doubt I could bug the robot itself, but why not the room...?_

Shaking her head, Vanessa rifles through the computer's files. After a few moments, "Huh. Everything seems normal... Or maybe I'm just not looking right."

"Well, here's a log just before the attack," Vanessa calls over, after having read a file. "They came in that morning, made sure the machine was working, then hooked it up to the computer mainframe that kept it charged. Put live ammo in, and left it there to be tested."

**It's possible there was something sent via the mainframe?** the Ghost inquires curiously, sounding distracted.

The Ghost Knight keeps looking. He spots something... No, wait, that looks susp- oh. No, that's just an interior part fused to the interior after the sparks show.

_So many electronic gadgets around here, who'll notice one more, hmm?_ DarkGlow tucks a miniature transmitter out of sight. _Transmitter... Hmm..._ He stares at the robot. _How much you want to bet they tried to shut it down remotely during the attack? Maybe someone's got a 'super' remote control._ He wanders back to the robot and attempts to locate the thing's transmitter.

Seemingly finished with his own probe, GK wanders over towards Van. Eyesockets narrowed, he inquires, **What else have you been able to find?**

Vanessa ums, "Well... there's data here on what the mechanisms do. Lots of schematics, weapons systems... uh, possible improvements..." She scrolls down the list. "Here's the file on its' programming."

GK offers to take over the computer for a moment, and begins to rapidly scan the material available. Though he's not a CS student, he's aware of the time constraints the group is under. **DarkGlow, any update?**

The Knight gets through the programming file, and is moving through the theories on adaption, before Vanessa asks, "How are we doing on time?"

Shrugging a bit, GK stops for a moment and 'defocuses' again, seeking out the presence of bodies upstairs in Lane's office.

DarkGlow shrugs. "Not really. But I was thinking that maybe someone just got a hold of an override code and took it over remotely, rather than from the inside. Just gonna take a look at the transmitter, see if it's listening on more than one frequency or something."

**A good idea..** the Ghost comments, distractedly.

The programming file regards some information on the Mainframe. The mainframe is a large machine built into the wall in one corner. It's multi-functional, allowing for the recharging of the tank's batteries, as well as feeding information straight to Hub where systems operations are inserted. Essentially, the brain. That Brain is accessable through the terminals in the Lab, as well as Ortabon's computer.

As GK searches for the technicians, it seems that they are in the elevators now.

**We haven't much time,** GK announces, then quickly resumes his scanning. **I advise we meet with Ortabon in a few minutes and discuss this.**

DarkGlow looks up from tracing the trasmitter's leads. "Lovely." He looks back into the robot. _Is that a fail safe? Has it been bypassed or something?_

Ghost Knight atleast gets through the hopeful fixes. Vanessa pauses, biting her lip. "I'll be right back!" Before running out into the hall. Darkglow's investigations earns that yes, it is a fail safe.

DarkGlow scowls. _Well if that's not a fail safe I don't know what one is. So why in Hell didn't it work?_

Darkglow leans in, and inspects the failsafe for a few moments. And, after poking at it, even prying it open carefully with a lockpick, he finds that some of the wires inside are fried. Vanessa comes peeling back in. "Okay, I think we're safe, but let's move; the elevator doors will open any minute."

GK nods, moving quickly. **Let's go,** he announces to the other man. **Bring that with you if you need.**

DarkGlow straightens, hauls out his dagger and does a quick excision on the fried component. He joins GhostKnight when complete.

The three move back descreetly to the fifth floor, while Ghost Knight's observations find that the scientists seem to still be in the elevator for atleast two minutes, until the doors finally open. They arrive safely, undiscovered, arriving just outside of Ortabon's office.
