# Millennium City Chronicles 2003-03-02

Six O'clock. Work is over, really. Been over for a while; no calls today. Nothing significant, atleast. A mother who wants to know where her son is going after school. Great, grand schemes that require every inch of the private eye skill. That infomercial on modivation didn't help at all, it seems. The sun is sinking, a dark blue hanging outside the window.

Guy leans back in his chair with his feet up on his desk. something he'd found a while ago just waiting to be tossed out. It hadn't taken much to get it up to a state of good repair. Just a little elbow grease. And wood. And love. It was the kind of desk that held a million stories if you knew how to listen. He sighs. A long exasperated sigh, and goes back to staring at the phone, as though willing it to ring. Yeah, that kind of stare.

There's a whisper across the wooden floor. A scratchy, whispy swish coming from the door. Then the sound of footsteps moving rather rapidly down the stairs of the bar, just down the hall.

Guy sits up. Well sort of. He shifts his view from where it had been on the phone to the door now. He mouths softly "Well who could that be? On a day like today." He sits up, feet still on the desk, and waits to see who it is. Probably just the bartender. Or a drunk looking for the bathroom.

And as Guy leans up to look at the door, something catches his attention. A manilla envelope, a big one, sticks out from beneath the door.

Guy perks an eyebrow. "Manilla envelopes eh?" He sighs, and reclines back a little so as to remove his feet from the desktop with ease. He stands up, stretches his legs, and heads for the door. He stoops down to pick up said envelope and peer inside. "Maybe I'm finally gettin' paid."

Before anything paticular comes to his eyes, the phone rings.

Guy blinks. With surprise. "Well I'll be darned. It worked." He heads back to the desk, and slips the envelope open while answering the phone. "Hello, if you need a private eye, than I'm your Guy..."

"Guy Neville, havn't changed your typical answering methods, eh?" The voice is familiar. Too familiar. The fact that debts are owed immediately click into Guy's mind as soon as the voice carries over. "Got the envelope, right?"

Guy leans back in the chair. The same familiar 'creeeeak' is heard as his feet return to their spot on the desk. "Nah. It's for the customers, mostly. But then you already know I've got the envelope. So tell me what's on your mind? Aside from hair and bones."

A chuckle. "Well, the Professor has another request. This should work towards that little tab you have with us. Put your hand into the envelope and take out the biggest sheets inside."

Guy's voice is a tenor voice. It's not the smoothest of voices, but then he's not the smoothest of Guys. He nods, "Ah. A little favor eh? C'mon I must've paid your boss back by now." He reaches into the Envelope and removes the biggest sheets, scanning them. "Well?"

Pictures. The topmost is of a man like individual, wearing all black, his head is simply a leering skull. "That is the Ghost Knight. He's... supposedly a superhero protecting the streets from everyone. From drug dealers to crooked corporate executives." The next picture is him, an albino man, a woman in a trench coat, scarf, hat and glasses standing in front of a man with slight asian characteristics on a bench. "He and two others stopped that rampage in Rennaissance Square yesterday. The man of asian decent is Lydon Yamaguchi."

Guy peers at the pictures. "Yeah? What about'em?" He studies the faces. He remembers reading about the rampage in Rennaissance Square. And about the Ghost Knight. Vigilantes. "Vigilantes, I s'pose."

"Right. Well, I want you to get close to the Ghost Knight. I want you to watch him. The Professor wants as much information on him as possible. He and those two other vigilantes have banded together, under Lydon. You're going to get buddy buddy with them, and find out everything you can about the Knight, Lydon's relationship, their practices, and what they do. 'Recruit' yourself to their cause."

Guy chuckles. "So you're telling me that the big boss is so desperate to know about two little vigilantes that he resorts to asking you to ask me? He must be slipping. So what do I do after I've joined the cause?"

"Not so fast. Who says he doesn't allready know? The Professor simply wants you to keep your eyes on the Ghost Knight. There's more to him, and he wants to know, wants it watched. The one on the right, the albino? He's a loose cannon. Used to be a contract killer. He needs to be watched, to make sure no one working for the Professor 'accidently' gets snipped when contact comes between this group and his."

Guy explains. "You just said he doesn't know. And I quote, 'The Professor wants as much information on him as possible.' So..." He rocks back and forth in his chair. "While the big bossman goes about doing what he does, I get to play babysitter to some two-bit thug who hangs around with some others?"

"Oooh, touchie! What better do you have to do? Babysit some supposed cheating husband and make sure he doesn't diddle his secretary, else you tell his wife? They'll be at the FoxMecha Tech building tonight. Just watch them, from there. And, think of it like this, my friend. If you had your thumb on certain illegal activities, wouldn't you like to have a thumb on the people who are trying to stop it?"

Guy nods. "Yeah. But when I babysit the cheatin' husband... rampage stopping isn't generally on the list of suspected activities. This sorta thing's dangerous. Then again. FoxMecha Tech building? Yeah. I'll be there. Thumbs and all."

"Be there around eight, or so. Keep your eyes open. They're a slippery bunch. Be careful; the Ghost Knight has some sixth sense about seeing people through walls, or something like that. Who knows, you might find work out of this; it could pay off. Not every normal Guy can do it, right, my friend?"

Guy chuckles. Darkly. "Yeah but then you and I both know that normal's just a setting on my washing machine. Well. If I had a washing machine. I'll do it I suppose. Tell your boss I said hi. And that he ought to read more." He slips the photos back in the envelope, and opens a desk drawer. A veritable library is inside. Most of them books on random things. "Mostly Harmless is a good one. Is there anything else, buddy?"

"Don't piss off the albino. You're no good as a stuck pig. Oh, and if you do a good job, we'll look into seeing your debt payed off eventually. Keep those eyes private and open, Guy."

Guy nods. "Eventually. Always the catch isn't it?" He checks to see what else is in the envelope. "Is there anything else you need from me, or should I hang up now and find my way to FoxMecha Tech?"

There's a badge for clearange into the FoxMecha building, with Guy's picture on it. Blueprints of the building. "Nothing immediate. And hey, who knows. The Professor may send you some cash. How about that. Have fun, my friend." Click. Dial tone.

Guy says, "Click. Dial toooooooooooone." He then hangs up the phone, and looks a good deal more frustrated than he had been. "Guy... what in the world have you gotten into this time... don't answer."

Guy heads over to his files, and tries to see what he can find out about FoxMecha...
