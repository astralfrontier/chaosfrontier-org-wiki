# Millennium City Chronicles 2003-05-06

Darkglow is left on the playground. The alleyway, with it's room overlooking, looms above. Simply by the feeling inside the assassin, he can Tell there are shadows in there.

DarkGlow steps into the darkened alleyway, and then steps out inside the overlooing room. Invisible in the shadows, he scans the room for other occupants.

None. Infact, the room looks... pretty barren. Well, except for some litter, and a chair situated in front of the window.

DarkGlow cocks his head at the chair. _Interesting..._

Being one in the dark, eyes seeming always adjusted for this kind of work, the thief spies something that's barely visible in the gloom streaming into the window. Something's scrawled on the wall, below the window.

DarkGlow goes down to one knee by the writing, looking closely.

Apparently, those sensitive eyes are better then he thought. The writing isn't obvious, but there. 'MavrickX was here'. On closer inspection, a few other things written beside. 'The buffalo can't crack worth shit.' 'Ha. End game; I win.'

DarkGlow rolls his eyes and turns his attention to the chair. _Seems I'm not the only one with this idea..._ A gloved finger runs over the chair's seat, in apparent imitation of a butler, or perhaps a drill sergeant. _Clean. Hmm..._ Ignoring the chair for a moment, he looks out through the window, gauging exactly what he can see of the exterior.

A grand view of the playground. And not just the playground, but around it, too.

With another glance at the chair, DarkGlow moves to inspect the door, to see if it is intact, and perhaps even boltable.

The door is still managible. While the building is not in the best of shape, either empty or yet to be sold, it has yet to fall apart. A lock is in the door, but nothing that a swift kick or three woudln't fix. Darkglow notices something, almost by accident, spotted out of the corner of his eye. A phone jack. Looking in good condition, from what he can tell.

Offhandedly locking the door--you can never tell when a delay of a kick or three could be useful--DarkGlow moves to the phone while feeling for a screwdriver from one of his belt pouches. From another a simple gadget is drawn. Once the jack's over is off, its leads are touched to the phone line's exposed wiring and DarkGlow waits to see if the activity indicator lights up. _Doubt the line's active, but you can never tell..._

Either the gadget is lying, or the phone line is actually working.

DarkGlow blinks in surprise, and looks at the vacant chair. _So who are you then, my myterious spy..?_ Connecting a tiny version of a linesman's terminal to the phone, DarkGlow dials an ANI, an automatic number identification system, and waits for the computer on the other end to read off the telephone number he's calling from.

The computer reads back 847-3308.

DarkGlow makes note of the number, and quickly reassembles the phone jack into its previous condition. _Now why would an abandoned building have an active phone line...? That sort of thing costs money. But if our intrepid spy is using the line, why doesn't he just use a wireless connection? Curious. The number's a start anyway._ He purses his lips as he stares at the chair, then with a shrug makes certain that the chair is out of the way of the light cast by the window and seats himself in it. A shadow in the corner but a step away will be his emergency exit, should one be required. DarkGlow settles down and prepares for a longish wait.

Nearly nodding off, the vigilant watcher is there until sunup. The sky draws a little light, then begins the morning, half past six.

With a sigh, DarkGlow draws his cell phone from within his cloak. _Think this is a good time to check in..._ He taps in GhostKnight's contact number.

The phone rings thrice. **Speak,** says the unnatural voice on the other end, after a few moments.

DarkGlow says, "And be heard. Yeah, yeah. Nothing's happened here. How goes it with you?"

Thomas rolls over on the ground, half-covered in blankets. Not much except force of habit is permitting him to craft his artificial voice, but he blinks away exhaustion enough to reply. **Well enough. Any results?**

"Um. Tired are we?" DarkGlow asks, amused. "Still in bed--excuse me, in your crypt--then? I just said nothing's happening. Then again, perhaps you meant have I discovered anything about the active phone line in this little room? In which case, yes, I know it's number and will be seeing where the bills go. Or perhaps you meant have I learned anything about this room's other watcher? That, I'm afraid, I've not much to report on."

**Excellent. I'll be in touch soon.** The phone clicks as Tom hangs up, and slumps back down, reaching up and feeling blindly over the surface of his bed for a pillow. He tugs it down and collapses again. "college is hell.."

DarkGlow smirks down at the cell, resisting the temptation to call the number back a time or three. _Mister Skull seems to be used to a schedule other than us nightowls'._ Thinking about breakfast--or dinner, rather--DarkGlow kicks at one of the wrappers on the floor. _Hmm... Snack foods have expiration dates..._ He stoops to grab a couple.

The dates suggest someone has been here several times. These chips should have expired three weeks ago. Those nuts? Last month. The cookies, this week or so.

DarkGlow drops the wrappers back to the floor. _And now a trip to the local convenience store can tell me how long the junk food is good for, and so around when our other visitor bought and ate them. Time to go I think, but first..._ Carefully, a grain or two of dust is almost invisibly deposited on the edge of the chair, which he moves back to where he found it. Anyone sitting in it would be certain to dislodge the dust. With a final glance out the window at the playground, DarkGlow steps into the corner's shadow and vanishes, on his way back home.

---

Ring. Ring. Or rather, the sound of the muffled vibration enters Tom's ear as he walks into his bedroom later that day. Chris came with him, having nothing better to do for the evening. Fortunately, she's in the kitchen grabbing something to chew on.

Thomas sighs, hitting the button viciously to answer. He waits for a moment, listening for the voice on the other end of the line.

"Ghost Knight?" Vanessa's voice calls through the other end. "I've been trying to get ahold of you. So's Lydon. Dead in waiting?"

**I am busy,** replies Tom curtly, directing his influence over sound into the phone, and nowhere else. **What is it?**

Vanessa huffs. "I did some digging, and got some information for you. Not a lot of corporate stuff... but there has definetly been some computer flubs in the New Purple Gang's favor."

Thomas sighs to himself. **Please compile a report. I will join you presently,** he directs to the phone, glancing at the kitchen. Time for some heavy duty caffeine, it is.

"Right," Vanessa answers. "So, um... Where should we meet? I can get ahold of the others easily enough."

Thomas clutches his head, and hangs onto the phone as though groping for reasons not to crush it. **Three blocks south of the North Detroit playground,** he suggests. **DarkGlow mentioned something which I wish to investigate.**

Thomas sighs to himself, reviewing his schedule. A busy day, a busy night, a busy tomorrow.. There should at least be a paycheck in all this. Then again, he considers soberly the value of all that he's been doing. Lives saved, a chance at a halfway-functional shield from enemies criminal and otherwise.. "Hey Chris, I gotta go for awhile... will you be okay?" he calls.

"Aw," She pouts, and pokes her head into the doorway. "Where you going?"

Thomas holds up the phone. "I got a call," he says carefully. "I'm supposed to go pick someone up in North Detroit. Family business," he adds, his private code-word for anything relating to his powers or alter-ego. "I promise I'll be back soon."

Chris sighs a little, and shrugs her shoulders. Walking over to her purse, "Well, I have some things I need to work on for Arlene I can do... Mind if I use your computer, Tom?" She does look a little dissapointed, but Tom can trust she won't hold it against him. She hasn't told him too many things about his family, but she does know that usually when Family calls, there's a lot of bowing to it.

"Yeah, no problem," replies the college boy lightly. "Anyway, see you!" And off he goes, shaking his head and sighing again...

Some phone relaying, teleportation, and public transport later, the group has migrated to the aloited spot chosen by the dead knight. The only one who's even slightly visible is the gum-shoe, but the Knight detects all of them within the spot. Hiding via their means.

**Come out, already,** announces the dead detective, sighing a little to himself.

Vanessa melts out of the wall, walking towards Ghost Knight with a folder under her arm.

"What makes you think we're in the closet?" DarkGlow asks curiously, as he drops his cloak and steps forward.

Guy isn't exactly hiding just yet. He does step out a bit more though, trenchcoat fluttering behind him as he walks. "Yeah? Whatcha got then?"

**Vanessa, report please,** says GK. **DarkGlow, after that, I'd like to look at the phone line you reported..**

DarkGlow shrugs. "It's got a plastic covbering and live electrical wires inside. Pretty standard stuff, I should think. I thought you'd be more curious about the number. "

Van grins behind her mask, and opens up the folder. "Well, I did some checking last night, and pulled some strings, and found out a few things. The New Purple Gang is the most likely suspect, because there's been some weird things for them. An armored car was going to make a delivery, but the shipment address was changed; it was an ambush by the Gang. The computerized alarm system of a jewelry store? Not a peep. A witness in a shooting by the thugs? He was sniped arriving to his place of hiding. Criminal records, lost from databases..."

DarkGlow asks, "New Purple Gang? What did I miss?"

**Thus, the New Purple Gang is our strongest current tie-in with this posited hacker,** remarks the Ghost, neutrally. **Convenient, since I am investigating them myself. DarkGlow, if Vanessa hasn't been told about the phone line and number, please inform her. Vanessa, please ask Lydon to pull what strings he can to get a list of calls to and from that number. In the meantime, we three should return to the room that DarkGlow found.**

"The New Purple Gang?" Echoes Guy, "Huh. I wonder if they've ever had a contact named Shawntae. That fellow I'd met up with didn't seem quite right you know. Thought I was hunting something... mentioned some kid named Shay who ended up not walking after the shooting. Did that name turn up in any of your investigations?"

**It did,** says GK. **I have a... related appointment, actually. Please, both of you accompany me after we examine the phone line.**

Through their various means - obviously no parade of costumed freaks - the four make it to the building which Darkglow investigated. He of course enters and lets them in discreetly. The others are filled in for the phone number on the way up to the room.

**Ownership records for this building would be useful,** says GK quietly. Then he begins to concentrate, standing patiently still.

"...and that's how I figured out the line was live," DarkGlow finishes, suppressing annoyance at GhostKnight's casual interruption. "Not exactly rocket science. Getting info on the number out of Bell, however, isn't my thing."

"Indeed. I could see if I could find out the info on the number, as well as the ownership records on the building. Yeah, not a problem."

With a curious glance at GK's still figure, DarkGlow moves to inspect the chair. Not a lot of time has passed, so he expects his tiny telltales to be intact.

"So do we have any idea when this was last accessed? Maybe there's a pattern. Uh... maybe someone should keep watch to make sure no one sneaks up on us...?"

It is, infact, intact. While Darkglow checks, the Ghost Knight's own investigation proves to be fruitful; the juncture appears to have been set up legally.

Vanessa peers down at the phone jack a second, then the writing on the wall. "Um, guys?" She points to the jack. "Does the writing look like online stuff?"

**The jack installation appears legitimate,** remarks GK after a few moments. He peers down at the writing Vanessa indicates, curiously.

The gum shoe kneels down beside, peering at the writing on the wall. He scans it a moment, "End game; I win? It might. I mean, to me anyway. I can't remember the last time I've seen graffiti use a semi-colon though. Hmmm. I wonder if this has any connection with that DSL jack in the kid's apartment..."

Vanessa nods. "I mean, MavrickX? Sounds like a screen name or something to me. So if this is online stuff, then maybe the jack was used for a dialup modem?"

DarkGlow straightens from his inspection. "What kid?" he asks Guy.

Guy explains, "Shawntae. Tall gangly kid. I went and talked to him while you guys were off investigating? I thought I'd told you about him. After all we'd reported in, still..." Guy proceeds to tell them about his interview with Shawntae.

Thomas listens quietly, patiently. Finally, he nods. **It is of utmost importance that we obtain records for this phone line's use, and correlate to the incidents Vanessa reported. This 'DSL' business also merits immediate investigation. Shall we?**

Vanessa peers out the window for a second, before glancing over. "Right. Back to the computer, I guess."

"Alright. I'll see what I can get ahold of for y'guys. It'll be fun. Unless y'know, we get shot at or somethin' but..." Guy pauses a moment, before adding, "How can I get ahold of you guys, should I find something out and need to tell you immediately?"

**Call DarkGlow,** suggests GK. **Your priority is the phone records.**

DarkGlow smirks. "I think our valiant skeleton thinks too many people call him at odd hours as it is..."

**I have more investigations than just this,** answers GK calmly. **For instance, a ranking member of the New Purple Gang, who may prove a useful informant if this line of inquiry bears no fruit.**

DarkGlow nods agreeably. "Yeah. Y'hear how weak his characteristic rumble is? But a... excuse me, shadow of what it was. But I must admit, this hero stuff can be a bit tiring. But be that as it may... Shall we depart this not-so fair abode?"

The four part. Guy and Vanessa go off for digging into the law works, while DG and GK slip off to address the gangbanger meeting. It is well dark by the time they arrive at the lot across from a few nondescript buildings. Three african youths are there, sitting on the hood or leaning on the door of the demolished car that rammed into the light post. Dray is there, as is Jersey, and an intimidating looking man, leaning against the ruined front of the car.

DarkGlow wonders if the skull will be killing these thugs quickly, or skinning them slow. Tilting his head curiously, he waits for the hero to open the 'dialogue'.

**These men are informants,** GK remarks quietly to his partner. **If you kill them, I will personally send you after them to take their reports.** With that said he strides forward, making himself visible in the lot, stopping only when he's perhaps ten yards distant.

_Skin them slow, but leave them alive. Gotcha._ With a shrug, DarkGlow follows.

Jersey and Dray come to attention as the Ghost Knight makes his presence known. The built individual straightens up slowly, eyeing the dead vigilante and his glowingly white companion. "Who's he?" Dray asks with enough false bravado to fill a bully, pointing at the albino.

**He is working with me. If you have questions about him, you can ask him. For now, I want to know everything you can tell me.** He waits, confident enough in his tactics from earlier that these boys will remember and comply.

DarkGlow looks between GhostKnight and the gang members. He realizes his foot is tapping impatiently and quells it.

"Yeah, yeah. Um, Tyear? Yeah, he was apparently pissin' around the Black Aces' territory. He was making threats, and everybody, day knew he'd shot a brotha named Diron, right? Well, he and his boy, Jerome, they were lookin' for a fight, right? Made a comment about Diron. We opened up."

Thomas nods slowly, listening.

DarkGlow blinks in surprise. _Damn, I think I left my pocket translator in my other pants..._

Dray goes on. "So, um... yeah. Y'see, Tyear was from outta town. But he was lookin' to start some dealin', and the Black Aces don't like that on they turf, yeah? Atleast, you gotta ask nice, give them a cut. Or they give you a cut." He grins nervously.

DarkGlow rolls his eyes. _My God, it puns._

**Black Aces. Where can they be found?** ask GK, almost casually.

"Uh..." Dray glances to the bigger man, who straightens up again. "Pool hall, named 'Spades'. You find all you want there."

The Ghost nods once, then turns to leave. **You have been very helpful. Thank you,** he remarks coldly, moving back towards the shadows and away from the lot.

"Hey, uh... wait!" Dray calls. "So... I can go, right? You need anything else? What you doin' with all this?"

The Ghost turns, empty eyesockets narrowing. **If I need you... I'll find you,** he says coldly. **My reasons are my own. If you need me I suggest you take out an ad in the newspaper or something.**

"Yeah... um, a'ight." He glances off towards the buildings a second, before turning toward the other two, who start to walk away.

With a silent sigh, DarkGlow turns and trudges after GhostKnight. _No skinning, I guess. Why do I get the feeling there won't be any next time, either?_

While DarkGlow is off working, the Ghost Knight is busy with his own task. Through the sewers and underground he travels, to a small shop for photographers he's used before. No security system dependent on sensing vibrations as window-glass breaks will deter someone coming through the floor. Some of Tom's own cash is deposited in the till, and a micro-camera, used for home surveillance, is plucked in one gloved hand from its resting place, passing harmlessly through the molecules of the display case that would otherwise be triggering an alarm now. The vigilante returns to the room overlooking the playground, taking his time installing the thing. A bit of the wall is shaped out of the way for the camera; in the gap, he places the thing, carefully covering over as much of the hole as he can and trusting the natural shadows of the room to do the rest...

Meanwhile, back with Guy. After doing some computer digging, Guy finds that the building is owned by the City. The previous owner having went bankrupt, and thus the property going to the bank. A ring on Guy's cell phone - the phone that Lydon had sent to him.

Answering the phone, Guys will say, "Hello?" He continues reviewing the data being pulled up on the screen, before turning away to pay more attention to the phone. _I hope this isn't bad news..._ "Guy speaking..."

Elsewhere, a short time later, DarkGlow is in an apartment he had never set eyes upon previously. He mutters to himself in a black basement as he fiddles with finicky wiring in the building master phone junction but the damn LEDs on the high-freq DSL bug won't light. With a curse, he yanks one of the wires back out, straightens the exposed lead with his teeth, then reinserts it. The LEDs blink cheerily before going dark again. _Bloody finally... Doubt this is gonna do much good--bet the kid mostly surfs porn, like every other teenager._ With a last glance as his handiwork, he closes the box's cover, puts away his tools, steps into the closest shadow and emerges behind the building.

"Hey Guy," Van chirps into the phone. "I found that the bank owns the place. What'd you get?" She asks, the sound of typing heard. "You want to look up who owns the phone cord then, or looking up this Mavrick guy?"

"I've found out that the building is owned by the City as well. Property went to the bank. I've been trying to see who the previous owner was... and who uses it now, but uh..." He types a bit on the keyboard, randomly pressing buttons really, more for show than anything, "I can look up whichever. This Mavrick thing sounds interesting."

"Okay, then I'll take the owner of the phone line," The witch assures. "Anything else?"

"Yeah. Have you been able to find any reference to, uhm, what was it, Shay? Or one of his crew, Tyear? Or references to the New Purple Gang... I've got a hunch about this..." says Guy, hitting more buttons on his keyboard.

"Yeah, have you been able to find anything else about this Shay character? Something doesn't sit with me quite right... that name's popped up twice now. One more time and it's no longer coincidence, they say. And anything about the New Purple Gang in connection with this stuff could be useful..."

"Well, from what I can tell, he was shot, and got out of it all after that. I havn't seen anything else..." She hrms. "I'll keep looking and get back to you?"

"Alright. Hmmm. I don't know if you're any god at finding this sort of thing.. but check to see if you can find any orders that look... 'hacked'? IE untraceable address, or weird signatures... that phone jack has to be kept active somehow, and I doubt we're going to find an easy to follow paper trail. Hmmm. See if you can access records for a DSL line provided by the local telco at this address..." He then recites Shawntae's address and apartment number. "That might be something worth knowing. Then again... it's just a hunch."

Vanessa opens a notepad and jots that down on her end. "Right," She calls, peering back at the screen. "I'll do some snooping." The phone of Guy's office rings.

After hanging up the one phone, he picks up the other, and answers with his professional voice. Well... okay, his normal voice, but trying to make it sound like he's not sitting around typing. "Hello?"

"Hello, Guy," Comes that familiar voice once more. "How's the sloth sleuth today?"

"Lazy, as usual. Nothing much in the way of anything going on. Which reminds me, my socks are wet. But what can I do for you chum? You obviously aren't calling just to find out how I'm spending my time." Informs Guy, while reclining in his chair with his feet on his desk. Nasty cliched habit though it may be.

A chuckle on the other end. "Well, gum shoe, you didn't answer in your professional little greeting, so I have a hunch you're busy. Say. You seem to be hunting a hacker, eh?"

"Hunting a hacker? Well then, you know more than I do. I'm hunting someone... however, as usual, you seem to have done my job for me. So what else am I doing?"

"Keeping tabs," Comments the voice in that 'not so serious but we both know better' way. "Y'see, the Professor wants you to keep a close eye on what you're doing, give a report, all that good stuff. Just keep an eye on what you find, when it all is said and done. He's interested in the results."

"Natch. So I'm hunting a hacker? What else do you know." Guy taps on his computer then, this time closing his datafiles. Never can be too careful. "And don't worry, The Professor's going to get his report. All that good stuff. Something about stuff going on in North Detroit. A shooting a few years back. I'm still not sure of the connection though."

"Right, right. I'll get ahold of you later, when you know more. That way, he can know more. You know these educated types; they want to be on top of all the knowledge they can get, and all that. Anyways, you get back to work, and back to dicking. Be seeing you." Click.

Click. _I'm gonna be sooooo dead one of these days,_ Guy muses to himself. _Ah well, makes life interesting. We've got the New Purple Gang going on here, and a hacker of some kind. My guess is it's more than one. This MavrickX fellow... hmmm. Buffalo can't crack? Cracking. End Game. Hmmm. A hacker duel... but over what?_ After that private eye-style narration, he sits up, and begins going over his data once more, searching this time for records of activity around the North Detroit area. More specifically, he's looking for anything, or nothing at all, near that building.
