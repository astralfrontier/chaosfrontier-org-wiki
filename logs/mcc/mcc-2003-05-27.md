# Millennium City Chronicles 2003-05-27

Darkglow nods to Guy's report on the dead guy. He looks up to the apartment with a smirk. _So he's handling this, huh?_ Fingers flex, feeling the yearn for that Shade's Blade to come forth, to wet for the moment. _But I'm stuck here being the watchman. Great._ He looks to Guy and Van, not exactly sure what to tell them to do.

The Ghost occupies himself for a few minutes - a brief phone call from a concealed point in the shadows of the apartment complex is followed by a brief but comprehensive survey with his uncanny sense of awareness. He knows what he searches for; and the Yamaguchi corporate vans should be arriving soon. That should be enough to muster the proper chemical.

Carefully, Tom appropriates the chemicals he needs - from storage cubicles, from the laundry room, sometimes by darting through one of the unoccupied apartments. Once ready, his senses ever alert to the motions of the people in the apartment where his quarry lurks, GK moves through walls and floors, dispersing the gas carefully as he goes, always cautious to keep a solid zone of pure air around himself.

Shawntae's computer continues to flick back and forth. "Okay, just about time..." He stiffens up, though. Something smells really nasty. He stands up, alarmed. The light-headedness is really getting to him. Shit! The kids! He takes a few running steps to the hall... and just drops the coke in his hand. Following suit by the rest of him. GK can sense that the girls are dropping slowly aswell.

The vigilante pauses for a few moments, then reaches down to take a brief pulse, and otherwise examine his quarry. Satisfied that the unconsciousness is not feigned, he flicks a finger; the window latch opens of its own accord, and the dangerous vapors are pushed outward, escaping tracelessly into the atmosphere. With that settled, he begins the task of bringing each unconscious body into the living room, centering the family together. The vans should arrive soon; until then, the Ghost's attention is driven primarily to the computer.

The display before him is meaningless. Tom shrugs a little, sparing a glance at the unconscious family before snapping open the phone again and dialing Guy.

After searching for his cellphone within the pockets of his coat, while simultaneously opening a candy bar, speaks. Even if his mouth sounds filled with chocolatey goodness. "Guy here. What's up?"

**I have Shawntae and family. Three Yamaguchi corporate vans are expected shortly. In the meantime, please come to the apartment.** Tom snaps the phone shut, moving to release the inevitable locks on the front door.

Guy then hangs up the phone. A few button presses later, Vanessa is dialed up, "Heya. I'm told that it's going on now. I'm en route. Best head over? Or do whatever it is you're supposed to do." A quick call to DarkGlow will inform him of the same thing. He heads for a nice quiet, unobtrusive place. A place where he can teleport to wherever it is he needs to go.

Darkglow smirks. _Not worried about uninvited guests still?_ He shakes his head, and simply searches out the shadows in the hacker's apartment. Then leans back into the depths of the umbra embrace in his little hiding place, only to melt out of them in the apartment with Ghost Knight. Vanessa dresses down, changing her appearance before heading on foot.

Darkglow looks around for a few minutes, notes the lack of wounds on the outstretched trio, then props himself up against a wall. He doesn't really need to say anything.

After glancing at the code, Guy looks puzzled. "Huh. Looks like he's got a buncha Zombies being created around here. They're bound to mess with whatever security systems they encounter... specially ones that can work over your router... hmmm. Huh... hey... this one's got something to do with... controlling chips?"

**Find out what you can,** directs GK, glancing sidelong in DarkGlow's direction. **We haven't much time.**

After looking over the code a second time, Guy recognizes something. Vehicle Control Chip. A VCC. The chips which happen to be implanted in all cars in Millenium City.

"Hmmm. Vehicle Control Chip. Yeah... sounds like our boy. After all, these chips are implanted in all cars in Millenium City. Among other vehicles. Nasty business... supposedly helps the police recover stolen cars." Guy rattles off for a moment, then wonders. "So what do we do now?"

**Now we take the computer with us when we go,** muses GK calmly. **They'll be here shortly.**

A knock comes to the door.

Thomas also tunes in his helmet radio to police frequencies, heard only by his ears. He stirs, shooting his sense of perception immediately at the sound of the knock, surveying what can be \`seen' outside.

A lone individual is standing outside the door. A van is running outside, with one person in it.

**DarkGlow, please investigate,** directs GK in a low voice. **I am expecting three vans; I see only one.**

_Figures._ Darkglow vanishes from sight, before stepping out of the room. A few moments later, he visibly slips out of the shadows. "It's a Yamaguchi van."

Another knock.

Ghost Knight's cell phone rings.

**Guy, answer the door and get the family into the van please. DG, come with me,** directs the Ghost quickly, departing for another room. He answers once clear, keeping his 'voice' as low as possible.

"Ghost Knight?" Vanessa asks into the phone. "I havn't gotten any answer at the door."

Guy answers the door, flashing a rather winning smile. "Hello there off... ah it's you Vanessa. A sight for sore, officer expecting eyes... what's up?"

Thomas returns to the living room, shrugging a little. Some people.... **We get the family first. After that, the computer. After that, we move whatever must be moved from here.**

Vanessa doesn't exactly look like herself. She smiles, none the less, stepping inside while keeping the phone to her ear. She glances to the unconcious three. "There was a Yamaguchi van making a delivery in the area, and the dispatcher sent it first, ahead of the other two. How're we going to move them without anyone being suspicious?"

The Ghost Knight stretches out a hand, kneeling deliberately on the floor. Carefully he touches the surface, which begins peeling back, exposing a hole. Wiring, conduits, and other things begin to move themselves out of the way at his unnatural \`touch'. **Van, get the driver to back up next to the wall over there,** he says, pointing in one direction - the direction he least expects trouble to come from. **We'll go through the unoccupied apartment below.**

Vanessa watches with a touch of amazement, before nodding. She opens the door, and heads downstairs. Darkglow just takes the cue, and without much complaint, moves the shadows over to wrap around Shawntae. This he uses to pull him towards the hole, before the tendrils of darkness lower him to the floor of the apartment below.

Guy blinks when the hole in the wall begins to get created. "Whoa..." he says, while clearly having a Keanu moment. Guy snaps out of it. _Chill Guy. It's not like it's something you haven't seen before. Still, that is frickin' cool._ He then looks around. "Well... alright. That works. Where do we go from here? What do we do about these programs?"

A check of GK's perceptions notes that the van has moved into place. DG is all ready moving the teenager, settling her down. Then, with a simple shrug, he picks up the girl, and walks over the hole. Blackness wraps around him like a glove, easing him down to the floor on a shrinking pillar of black.

**We disconnect the computer and take it. We'll study it when we aren't at risk of discovery,** replies the Ghost, satisfied, as he examines the hole. Hopping downward, he begins applying his power again as the van pulls back, piercing the outside wall, the gap concealed by the body of the van.

With the hole openned, Vanessa and Darkglow work to move the three into the van. The magician pokes her head in curiously. "Hey, Ghost Knight? Why'd we need Three vans?"

**If they are friendly, I want to provide them the comforts of home. If not, I want to leave no trace of them,** explains the Ghost grimly.

Taking hold of the computer, Guy gives a nod. "Alright. I'll take care of the computer." He works swiftly to make sure nothing's terribly wrong back there, before disappearing back to a rather familiar location. His office. The door's been locked, of course. He then will phone the others.

In time, the two other vehicles arrive. Tom, with as much discretion as he can muster, repeats the procedure. Common furniture is left behind; but anything that could merit personal interest - heirlooms, photos, anything of personal value - that will fit in the vans is taken, and packed with as much care as Tom's precision powers allow. And with that done, the vans are directed to get on their way, and Tom seals shut his \`holes' with care. Then he's gone, like a departing spirit.

---

Tap. Tap tap tap tap tap. Guy has already hooked the computer up, and is snooping through it, checking the system records for access times, as well as activities carried out and programs operated. He's also checking out just where this computer was supposed to be connecting too.

"This... can't be good." Guy does a double checking of his thought process, before picking up the phone and dialing GK's number. He taps his fingers nervously on the desk. _Pick up pick up pick up pick up pick up pick up pick up pick up!_

---

The vehicles are headed for a place in Rivertown. A warehouse of the Yamaguchi Corp is in the area. The warehouse has some breakrooms and such. A few calls down the tree has said breakrooms left alone; not many are working there at the time, and a manager giving them some extra work for the moment doesn't surprise anyone. Thus the way is pretty vacant.

With directions given to him by cell phone, Tom makes his discreet way through the underworld of Millennium City, sometimes passing through solid matter, other times taking tunnels of a dozen possible descriptions. He makes a stop, out of costume, at a local Radio Shack, smiling and paying cash for a bag full of components. Then he's off again, and by the time the vans are unloaded, he's arrived and has started construction on something

Vanessa calls GK, after a second. "Um, we have a problem," She calls. "One of them's awake."

Thomas comes over to inspect the situation, frowning.

"I opened the back, and the older girl was trying to shake Shawntae up. I had to slam it." Vanessa points to the truck, before cracking her knuckles. "Okay, I think I can deal with this. But I'm going to need you to run a little distraction, or atleast keep them from getting out of the truck, while I get it open to put them to sleep."

Wasting no time, Tom does the most expedient thing - sealing the metal of the doors shut, one by one, swiftly and certainly. Then a gloved hand is laid against the bare metal of the side door, the one thing he hasn't sealed. **Any time you're ready,** he says to Van quietly.

Vanessa nods her head, and looks over to Ghost Knight. After a second, she offers, "Thank you... for not trying to hurt any of them." She then nods her head, after beginning. Ghost Knight peels the doors back, as Vanessa finishes what she has to. Latrice looks up, only to simply fall back onto Shawntae.

**Get the others into another room, give them whatever they need,** directs GK crisply. **I'll take care of him...** With that, he begins lugging the hacker, searching for an unoccupied room that can be sealed shut, and setting up his \`experiment' thereafter.

Then the three of them, DarkGlow having kept his suggestions of handling the awakened girl silent, move the three of them to their appropriate places. As Shawntae is placed in his own little room, GK's phone rings.

**Speak,** says GK, privately still sweating from the uncertainty and strain of moving quickly on an improvised schedule.

"Yeah... this is Guy. I did some checking on the computer... seems like the only way some of these programs can be implemented is from on site. IE, the VCC Main Frame. And, well, that just won't happen. Ever. Not with their sec-measures."

**Your first priority is to see if this thing has been sent to anyone else, if you can,** replies Tom, gritting his teeth. **If so, we must act soon. If not, someone will be seeking out that computer.**

"These weren't meant to be sent to anyone. At least not over the internet. They're designed to be directly downloaded into whatever system their target is." Explains Guy, while looking about nervously. "Where are you guys?"

Guy, getting the idea, instead checks the email account. An email from 'Violet' from some free email account seems to have been sent an hour ago. The subject: MavrickX, a reminder. The body simply reads, "We'll be seeing you in the morning. Tell those who you care about not to drive tomorrow."

The plan is simplicity itself. Tom provides a phone-line, along with a telephone to Shawntae's \`holding room'. He himself monitors what goes through it, and he's prepared to cut the line in case anything like the characteristic squeal of modulated data can be heard. He waits for the man to wake up, expecting that the second thing he does (after trying to get out) will be to make a phone call. Who Shawntae calls is as of this moment vitally important to Tom.

Fifteen minutes after the setup, Shawntae stirs. As predicted, he's not happy. He does try to get out. After that, Tom doesn't hear the phone's activity for atleast five minutes. Thomas gets alerted. 911.

The line goes dead. After a few moments, it's permitted to reset itself.

Shawntae tries it again, with the same results. He growls. This time, he tries the operator. 0.

Thomas breaks in, using his powers to simulate a voice response. "Operator?" says a bored female voice, into the line.

After several moments of collection. "Yes, Miss? Could you tell me what phone number I'm calling you from?"

Thomas thinks for a moment, then rattles off the phone number of a payphone - the one he remembers calling Lydon from, the first time, still in the assumed operator's voice.

Shawntae hrms. "Thanks." He hangs up the phone, then tries the police station's phone number.

Thomas thinks for a moment. He can't keep up this job of acting for long, so he tries a new angle. "Shawntae, don't push. Your usefulness to us is limited." he says, in a gruff voice, one that he hopes mixes sophistication with a threat - the voice of a Mafia don, perhaps.

There's silence on the other end for a few moments. "You got some balls to be trying that shit tomorrow, without me."

"There's been a high level decision. Your handling of the CAT incident left.. a trail. It was reported, even as far as the papers," Tom says evenly, carrying on the charade. "You're alive only until we decide what to do about your family. Any suggestions?" The last question is offered with a hint of mocking derision - a move designed to provoke an emotional reaction.

"Shoot them." There's a lot of emotions in that tone, but its' the venom that shines through it the most. "Then wrap your lips around the pistol, because after tomorrow, your ass will be hunted. You better just shoot yourself now. Because they're not going to hear from me. Not from my family, you dirty fuck. But they'll nail you." The phone quietly hangs up.

Smiling to himself, Tom hangs up his 'tap' and steps bodily through the door of the holding room, longcoat billowing slightly as its mass is tugged free of the door's solid matter. The skull stays still. **Your family is safe, Shawntae,** he says. **They're less than one hundred feet away.. but we need to talk.**

Shawntae stands up from the chair he's in, and grips it firmly. "Stop playing with me. Whatever you're going to do, Do it. Just shut the fuck up, and Do it."

**Alright then, I'll do it,** says the Ghost solemnly. **I offer you a job. Safety, security, steady income, housing for you and yours. We will not ask you to break the law. We will not threaten your loved ones to guarantee compliance. You are free to accept or decline.**

He doesn't respond. He's merely glaring. GK doesn't need any paticular powers of deduction to concieve that the man doesn't really trust him, or believe him.

Thomas hunches down, deciding for once to take a real chance. He reaches up, clasping the face of his mask, and pulls. Part of the material comes away - enough to reveal his eyes, eyebrows, and the bridge of his nose, all mortal. "Accept or decline," he says again, in his normal voice.

Shawntae doesn't exactly do a lot. He doesn't glare as much, but there isn't a lot of shifting expressions. "Okay, who are you?"

Thomas smiles behind the mask; a mostly unseen gesture, but the skin around his eyes must necessarily change, giving it away. "I'm the guy who wants to give you a job," he says again. "I want the New Purple Gang, or whoever has been running you. I want to put them away, along with anyone like them."

Shawntae sits down, and seems to relax just a little bit more. "Okay," He says, and puts his hands on his knees. "Okay then. Then talk."

Thomas squats on the floor, folding his legs into the Lotus form, a meditative and relaxed pose. "We tracked you down after the CAT went berzerk," he explains. "We went to the playground, the \`footprint' your hacking left behind in the FoxMecha computers. From there we asked some questions, and we found you." He smiles again. Shawntae can't compose enough facial detail to identify Tom, but he can see the eyes - the windows of the soul - clearly enough. Tom hopes it will suffice. "As to why, well.. I want to make the world better. That's all."

Shawntae's face crinkles up. He waits until you're finished. "How'd I leave a footprint? I was in and out of there in five minutes. I made sure I didn't leave any IP traces. Exactly what was my footprint?"

Thomas reaches out with a hand, his fingers splayed. The floor of the room changes, depressions in the material revealing the raw data Lane got his hands on. "This..." he says, even as the figures shift, forming themselves into a digital image of the playground, ".. were brainwave data that revealed this."

Shawntae stares at it. "Well... damn." He frowns and looks at it. "But I guess I was thinking about that at the time, yeah. Well damn." He sits back. "So what's this about security and a new place and money and all that?"

Thomas erases the embossed data in the floor, restoring it to its original form. "My patron will supply you a good salary. Your skills are obviously useful, for solely legitimate purposes." He reaches for his cell phone, popping it open and dialing Lydon's number.

"Yes?" Lydon answers the phone after two rings.

**I am facing the hacker who was responsible for the CAT,** says the Ghost's voice into the phone. **He is trustworthy. He needs a job. We need a man of his skills. I leave it to you two to discuss the particulars.** And with that, he extends the phone to Shawntae.

Shawntae takes the phone. "Hello? Yeah. Yeah, sorry about that, man. I don't know, all I know is, that was just what the guy looming over me told me to do next. Nothing personal man. Yeah, okay, good to see you're cool about it. So, let's talk business?"

Shawntae walks around the room a couple of times, continuing to talk to Lydon for around ten minutes, before he hangs up the phone. "A'ight. I think we got this taken care of then, ... Ghost Knight," He gropes for the proper term, which Lydon had said a time or two. "So... what now?"

Returning his mask's missing piece to its proper place, Tom stands. The voice is back. **Now.. tell me everything you know about the New Purple Gang, and the raid tomorrow.**

Shawntae sits down, and begins to explain the proceedings. Apparently, tomorrow is going to be a very big day. Tomorrow was a multi-scale assault to deal with some definite distractions. The first order of business was to use the zombies' scripts to deal with several high security facilities, and have their defenses pretty much take hostage anyone inside. This was going to offer a definite distraction for, at the very least, the Champions. However, the main distraction would be an assault on the building that houses the VCC's mainframe. He was to drop their security measures, and open the Heavily Armored doors that protect the system - the security system itself isn't as impressive as the mainframe's anti-hacking system. With some heavily armed guys at his side, Shawntae was to upload the zombie into the system, and take everyone on the Loop hostage. If so much money wasn't deposited into an account, by a certain time, there was going to be a Very Big pile-up on the Loop.

Shawntae sits back. "But without me, it's a no go."

Thomas stays quiet for moments, digesting this information. Then the helmet comes off - fully, this time. Underneath is a replica of Shawntae's face - imperfect in some minor details, but uncannily close in almost all respects. "This is not a problem," says Tom, in a voice that's still under alteration, as it seeks to approach the other man's.

"Now... I need you to teach me how to be like you," says Tom/Shawntae, testing out the new voice. Privately he feels strange, and not a little apprehensive about this move. But it may be the best way to deal with the New Purple Gang.

Shawntae sits back. "Woah." He looks his supposed double over, considering this for a second. "That's... impressive." He frowns. "I can do that, but exactly what do you plan on doing? How far you taking this? I mean, the people in the buildings, and on the Loop are going to be freaking out."

Thomas nods. "But only if your program actually gets inside, right? If nobody else has a copy of it, we're set - everything will be okay. But if not, then I'll need to manage things somehow, when we get there."

"No body was going to do it but me, because I have to get past the security codes, I bet, before I uploaded the script." He shakes his head. "But the thing is, I was going to fire off the zombies into the security systems **tonight**, so that they go off tomorrow, about the time that we're due to go after the Loop's mainframe."

Thomas nods slowly. "We can't allow this to actually happen. But I see this as my best opportunity to nab somebody important in the gang - I can predict where at least some of them will be, you know? So..."

"Right, right. But that means that I need to atleast do some of it, so that nothing will be suspected. Because I can probably bet you that if they don't start going off, whoever's over this is going to give a call, and they're going to look at You. Who's me."

Thomas chuckles softly. "We'll do one of two things. First, I can go in your place. We'll arrive at solutions for the other matters if you wish to do this. Second, you can go, and I will replace you inside, before it becomes obvious that there's been a problem. Since this could be dangerous, I leave it to you to decide."

Shawntae considers this for a few moments. "I want to be dead. Atleast, I want them to think I'm dead. I figure if you and me make the switch inside, you can do that eventually, right? I just gotta find a way to get the hell outta there when the bullets start going. I think I can do a better job if we switch, y'know?" He looks at the cellphone. "But you might want to tip off your man about the buildings with security systems about to get jacked up. Not tip off everyone, but maybe Something gets done. Because, if it were Me, and **I** was behind this, I'd be listening to the police radio. When those alarms go off, or **don't**, something wrong, y'know?"

Shawntae considers. "On second thought... Get me my computer. I can change those zombies. After about twenty minutes of haywire shit, they shut down. We get our desired effect, but as soon as they turn off, we got the real target alerted, right?"

"We'll work it out. If necessary I can produce a chemically and anatomically accurate corpse," says Tom grimly. He puts on the helmet again, resuming his original shape thereafter, and goes for the door. "We'll do that. For now, I want you to see your family, and wait with them while I handle getting the computer..." He heads out, pointing the young man in the right direction, and cracks out his phone as the reunion takes place...

"Guy here." Answers Guy, while the sound of the tap tap tapping of keyboard keys can be heard. "What's up?"

Thomas fills Guy in as succintly as he knows how. **... We need the computer now,** he finishes. **How soon can you make it over to the warehouse?**

Guy says, "So you know, I've got an email from some 'Violet' a user account from a free email setup that was sent... maybe an hour or two ago. The subject is MavrickX, a reminder. They say they'll be seeing him in the morning, tell those he cares about not to drive tomorrow. Tell me where the warehouse is and I'll be there..."

Thomas gives Guy the best directions he's able. **I'll fill you in on that matter when you arrive,** he says.

With the snap of the phone being shut, Guy will arrive, computer and all. At least he'll arrive rather near the warehouse. He still will have to get in the old fashioned way. Walking.

Thomas spends the time explaining the situation to the rest of the team in detail, quoting verbatim from some portions of the conversation, giving a bald summary of others.

DarkGlow grins a little bit at this. "Okay. Looks like we're going to be busy tomorrow." _Now here's where this job gets interesting._

Guy nods then. "Gotcha. Wow. Complicated plan. So... in essence, we're going to go get ourselves shot to pieces tomorrow?" He grins. "Sounds like a plan."

Vanessa frowns at that. "... Well, then I guess we need to figure out how we're going to take them out. Counterplan, all that."

Guy says, "Why don't we just uh, let the mainframe guards know ahead of time, so that they can be on the alert, and have MARS there?"

**The trick is not to give an alert too early - and scare away the Gang before we get a lead - nor too late - and cause trouble for the city,** says the Ghost thoughtfully. **We have until tomorrow morning to think of something.**

It doesn't enter Tom's mind once to just say \`sit on Shawntae and leave the problem to the city'. This is the continuation of his mission, perhaps more dangerous than his prior efforts, but also more rewarding. Those around him haven't yet fallen into the risky place of \`dependable ally'; should they walk away, he'd go in alone.

The group has several hours. Within that time, a plan needs to happen. By this time tomorrow, there will probably be a few dead, somehow, somewhere. All the group can try to do is forge a plan that takes this burden from themselves, and their new ally.
