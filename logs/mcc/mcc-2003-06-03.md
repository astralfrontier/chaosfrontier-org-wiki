The City Center has adequate defenses against the material; against someone who can mold the very earth and stone, to create a refuge leading down into the underground tunnels, very little can be done. The Ghost has spent much time ensuring that Shawntae has a way to get out of the Center and maneuver toward the carefully-emplaced signal-tracking systems; now that this is done, he waits patiently in the refuge, monitoring his own radio for word from his teammates.

Guy has taken up a position atop the rooftops some distance from The Center. He's mapped a route out that any police response units will be likely to take and has set himself up above one of those routes. He's currently observing The Center through a pair of binoculars, while carefully monitoring the police frequencies.

Tengu is on a nearby rooftop, waiting for the signal from the group, prepared for his section of the phase. Vanessa is across the street from Shawntae's apartment, waiting anxiously.

DarkGlow is casualy leaning against the Center's morning-enshadowed west wall. As nonchalant as the stance would appear, to anyone capable of piercing his invisibility, anyway, inside his skull is actually a mind tightly focused on the task ahead. He doesn't nervously pat the belt pouches hanging at his side, the tracking systems were placed securely inside them long ago, and his eyes quite unhurriedly scan the area out front of the Center. _Action time. Just stay calm, damn it. A bloodbath would be **very** counter-productive..._ Even as he cautions himself, though, he is perfectly aware of his shallow breathing, rapid heart rate and, above all, an intense desire for things to _just happen_...

Darkglow is the first one to see it. 7:20, a young man in an oxford, tie and slacks gets out of his car, briefcase in hand. He casually walks into the city centur. 7:30, Guy spots two get out of a truck, highschoolers it would seem, with backpacks. They stroll into another door. 7:39, three more have walked through seperate doors, each carrying dufflebags. One is dressed like a jogger, the other what blatantly could be called 'Tourist', accompanied by a woman with a large toatbag. The Ghost Knight's senses precieve new arrivals, along with everyone else in the building.

Thomas waits patiently, calmly confident. The Gang's plan must be allowed to execute without a hitch - right up to the end. Then, and only then, once the vault is again inaccessible to them must things go awry. He smiles to himself, even as his obscure sense continues to observe the developments above.

Guy informs the others of the Gang's arrival. "Two of 'em getting out of a truck, dressed as highschoolers. Truck is down a block or two. Dufflebags, briefcases and backpacks arte the things to lookout for."

7:55, Guy and Darkglow spot them. A low rider car with three inhabitants, one of which Guy can tell is Shawntae. 7:59. They get out of the car. All three are wearing purple leather jackets, even Shawntae, who is looking around extremely nervous and uncomfortable. The one on his left, a big man with what looks like a chrome police baton strapped to his back, the other wearing a stylized helmet. 8 AM. Hell breaks loose.

With a grim nod and a grimmer smile, DarkGlow steps forward and emerges in a convenient corner inside the Center. He glances quickly around for any... targets. He savours the feel of the last word.

Somewhere in the city, a large alarm can be heard. The police bands erupt. "Security measures at FoxMecha Tech." Nearly half a dozen other buildings and companies are mentioned on the police band. The sound of sirens pierce the air. Then an explosion, very small, and minute can be heard by DG, and Tom's senses spy a small explosion in the tunnels beneath the City Center.

"Hey heads up you guys. Lowrider's incoming. Shawntae and the gits in purple have arrived..." He then begins to inform them. "Something's going on with the security measures at FoxMecha Tech. Sirens are going off... wow, half a dozen other buildings and companies are being mentioned... whoa." Guy shakes his head, "Lemme know when you need my help."

Darkglow is just in time for the show. The bathroom closest to him opens, two guys in leather jackets, one toating an automatic rifle, his buddy a very sophisticated looking rifle. A security guard comes around the corner, immediately nailed by the two of them. About this time, Shawntae and his escorts enter the building.

Thomas waits still, thoughts racing. _A diversion - but is this the feint for another operation, or are the explosions a feint for this? We can't break now.._ **We're sticking to the plan,** he relays to Guy quickly and coldly. **Phase 2 may have to wait, but it would take time anyway...**

"Looks like the Zombies are working. At least according to Shawntae. But you've gotta point Ghosty. It could be either way. Let's keep our eyes open, as it were." Guy chuckles wryly, while directing his binoculars towards The Center and then, on a whim, the other buiildings mentioned on the scanner.

People scream. "Okay everybody," Shawntae's escort says, whipping out a nasty looking pistol, while the Baton wielder casually takes it off his back, sparks flying across it as he pulls a sawed off from his coat. "If you all shut the fuck up, and don't make a noise, we can leave here peacefully. The phones are Dead, so do not even attempt it."

The sound of gunshots are heard through various halls in the building. The helmetted pistol-wielder escort turns. "Okay, Shades, Mic, Rones, I want you to stay here. Tag the fuck out of anyone that comes through the doors, or tries to get out. We don't need to kill any more then we have to. Unless they run. Okay. Break."

Trying very carefully not to think how stupid planting a bug on a heavily armed maniac is when it would be much easier to plant a blade into 'em instead, DarkGlow watches closely as the pair he's spotted approach a likely, nicely shaded spot. Blade in his left hand--just in case, of course--and tracker cradled in his right, he blinks there, becoming just another pool of blackness against the wall. A thin tentacle of shadow flicks at his mind's command, tapping the closer one on the shoulder every so lightly as he walks past, oblivous. Tense, the thug starts, and brings his weapon partially around, but sees nothing--least of all the newly-added, tiny patch of black that's practically invisible on the black leather belt holding up his pants. He looks over his other shoulder, suspicious, but DarkGlow is already metres away, smirking at him invisibly. With a shrug, the gunman moves on.

The Ghost Knight can sense what's going on. Even if he can't see the spesifics, he can see various auras moving away from one or two groups moving through the building, two of them sweeping by the elevator that leads to the armor doored Mainframe, obviously dealing with the guards. Then they move to to where the others are. A group of six then begin approaching the Ghost Knight's position.

Thomas passes the tense moments calmly, his subterranean solitude aiding his focus. He knows what he's waiting for - the moment Shawntae enters the mainframe's secure area, above him. Even now, doubt worms its way into his thoughts, questioning the wisdom of the plan, questioning his own abilities. If he takes another man's face, can he have his own back after all? Now that it's really come down to it, he hesitates; but fortunately circumstances don't demand that he act yet. He has time to muster a counter against his own fear.

Darkglow heard the screaming wail of some eruption of sound, in the halls somewhere, before he spies two purple jacketted punks run out to meet the others. Like the rest of them, they're wearing sunglasses and hats, ski-masks or other facial guarding materials. He follows. "Stone, Scorch, I want you two to start busting into offices and combing the halls, rounding up people to stuff them in the main room with the others. Do as little damage as possible; we need cover. If you got any problems, let me know." The big man with the electric baton nods, as does one with the sophisticated rifle. "Check." They break, and head down a hall, leaving three and Shawntae.

Guy awaits news and further instruction quietly. Of course, he does his best to keep the others as informed as he can be. He keeps listening to the scanner as well. _Hopefully it's just Security Measures._

The scanner squacks again. "We have reports of gunfire in Westside, as well as a fire. All nearby units please assist."

They come to an elevator, where three crumpled guards, one with gunshot wounds, lay. There's what looks like a funny grenade sitting by. Ripping the keys off of one of the guards, the smallest of them unlocks the elevator, before the doors open. "Bombshell, go with him." The smallest nods, and gets into the elevator with him. The doors close. GK can sense the elevator lowering, two members on it.

"Just so you guys know, there're reports of gunfire in the Westside. As well as a fire. Seems like police are going to be occupied all over the city. Lemme know if you guys need backup..." Guy waits then, patiently.

The elevator lowers, the doors open, baring a small alcove with thick armored doors. Bombshell walks forward, and turns the key again, openning the doors. "Hey, I need complete concentration when I do this, so... I need quiet and privacy." The thug stares at him a second. "Okay. I'll keep the elevator open." She turns and holds the doors open, as the armored ones shut behind him. Shawntae looks around, while pulling his laptop from a bag at his side. "Ghost Knight?"

Hugging a wall, hand held slightly out, DarkGlow waits for his next target to approach. _Tag..._ he thinks, fingers flashing out and poking the thug's closely held rifle lightly and low. The thug barely notices anything, and DarkGlow watches as another of his trackers is carried away. His smirk becomes a nasty smile. _...you're it._

Thomas rises through the ground, then begins to open the way to the tunnel he excavated below, using his powers. **Tell me when you are ready,** he says. **I will require your clothing; you will find spare clothing below.**

Shawntae nods, and opens his computer, tapping into the mainframe and starting to work on the system. Three tense minutes go by. "Okay. I'll shut it down in ten minutes." He closes his laptop, puts it in his bag, and qiuckly strips. "Thanks, man," He says, and starts to climb down.

Thomas begins divesting himself of his own armor, feeling suddenly naked without it. Slowly but surely his body molds itself into a replica of Shawntae's, with the most detail applied to the face. He dresses, even as he listens to his own voice changing into that of the other man's, and once ready, he makes to leave the sanctum...

Up at the elevator's doors, DG watches as Helmet nods his head. "Okay. We have confirmation: Loop is hijacked. People are not coming off the exits. We're good to go." He touches another part of the helmet. "Shades, we're nearly ready to wrap this up. Send Scorch and Rones to the bathroom."

_The bathroom... what fun!_ DarkGlow thinks.

Beyond the doors, the autorifle wielding woman nods, and walks into the room. She shuts the armored doors, and removes a small blowtorch from under her coat. Shielding her eyes, it's taken to the doors for thirty seconds, then she stops, and walks back to the elevator. It goes up, to the waiting three thugs. "Okay, strap it in," Helmet says. The voice sounds... familiar to the fake Shawntae. Enaro. Two of the other members move into the elevator, and begin to wire what to GK looks like an explosive.

Across the police scanner, "We have an emergency. We're recieving calls that the Loop is not working. Calls are not going through to the City Center. Dispatch emergency units to the -" There's an explosion across the other end of the scanner.

Thomas allows his own fears and tensions to play across the borrowed face he wears, hoping that his own nervousness and tension will adequately substitute for Shawntae's. He says nothing, allowing himself to be directed meekly - an all-too-familiar experience from the long years under his father's strict tutelage and unyielding authority.

Helmet's voice can be heard grinning. "We have confirmation: attack under way. Okay, let's get the fuck out of here." With that, they begin moving. Bombshell pulls out her toatbag, and removes her hat, skimask, the purple jacket and places her rifle into the large bag. Another thug removes his coat, baring the backpack underneath. He begins packing up. "Bombshell, Nails, make a break for one of the cars." They nod, and move out a side door. Guy spots the tourist-looking woman and one of the highschoolers move swiftly to one of the cars, before getting in and reving the engine.

"So," Enaro says to Shawntae as they move through the halls, "You feel pretty good, huh? First job and all?"

Thomas shakes his head a little. "Not the first, exactly... " he mumbles in Shawntae's voice. "But it's easier to work from home."

"Uh guys... I think one of the police stations just exploded..." informs Guy, helpfully.

Guy spots that the highschooler in the car hops out, and runs down the way to jump into the driver's seat of another car, reving the engine. Two others in casual clothing come out, carrying bags, and get into the drivers' seats of the other two cars, turning them on.

"Well, you keep this up, and you just might get promoted, Kid," He says and smacks Shawntae on the back. "So. How's that cute kid of yours?" This said in a rather viciously teasing little tone. "She still breathing?"

"And it looks like the highschooler has just gone into a different car. Hmmm. Engine's revved? Two more coming out. Hey, DG, if you wanna plant the bug, now's your chance to get at the vehicles..." says Guy, from his position above The Center.

DarkGlow arrives back after fruitlessly checking out a couple of bathrooms. His smirk is now a scowl, but then he sees Shawntae and one of the thugs walking ahead of him. Urgency fades away. _One target, one tracker--can't be a coincidence. Someone likes me..._ He smiles briefly at the sheer unlikelihood of his last thought, and blinks into a cross-corridor ahead of them, last bug ready.

"I hope so," mutters Tom, with a hint of bitterness in his voice. In truth, he is somewhat concerned about this whole business, still. This is the first time he's tried something like this, and as the daring of it boils his blood, the risks of it chill his skin.

Darkglow's attempt to tag the thug is successful, tapping the guy's helmet. Shawntae and Enaro come out into the main room, where many people are clustered in in disarray; one or two are sprawled out on the ground, or curled up, nursing the results of punches and kicks. Three thugs are loitering about, weapons ready. "Okay, everybody, here's the thing. You are going to all run out at once, you got me? Everybody is leaving. Go to your cars, go do what the fuck ever, call 911 on your cellphones. Just do not get on the road, do not pull out of your car, do not do Shit. Or we will Shoot at your car. And believe me, we can blow it the fuck up. Is everyone CLEAR on that?"

Almost as one, everyone gives some sign of agreement. "Okay. Stand up." As they do, Enaro tugs on Shawntae. "You're with me." He then fires into the air, the angry pulse of energy nailing the ceiling. "RUN! Go! GO the fuck now!" Everyone scatters. He nods to the others. "Okay, GO!" And with that, the NPG members run to the doors. Guy spies a whole host of people erupt from the inside.

Thomas moves quickly, following along. Privately he regrets not being able to do something about the bomb, but under the circumstances this is the best he can do. At least they seem to be taking pains to help the civilians...

"Annnnnd they're off... it's that guy, followed by the Tourist at half-a-length and..." Guy comments, race-announcer style, while keeping track of who's going where. "DG? Didja get to the vehicles? They're gonna be leaving... soon I'll bet..."

Among the flood of people, the NPG make a break for it. Two get mixed up and go for the same car, before they orient themselves. Shawntae and Enaro come towards one car, before Tengu flies down, and plucks up the decoy Shawntae, as he starts to fly away. "What the fuck!"

The energy pulse slams into Tengu's back as he lifts off Tom. Tom can feel the initial jerk as Lydon, inside, curses. But it doesn't stop him. "Fucking... Fucking FUCKER!" Enaro screams, before rushing toward another one of the cars; atleast two of them are pulling out, now.

Over the sudden rushing wind, Tom shouts at his rescuer. "Bomb in building! Need my armor! Underground!"

DarkGlow glances at the Shade blade still in his left hand and decides that now would not be a good time to dismiss the weapon. Focusing his thoughts, he feels for the area of shadow in the back of one of the gang's vans, cast by one of the side windows behind the last seat. He takes moment to be relieved that the back windows are covered, and then he steps forward to catch his ride.

"So uh... guys? What's up? Anything going on that I should know about? I trust you all to have it handled... but uh, it looks chaotc down there," adds Guy.

Surprisingly, they're not driving vans, so much as cars, or one truck. Inside, the driver is fully in civilian clothes, while the passanger is unloading his things into a trashbag removed from the glove compartment, swapping on clothes. "Okay, we need to get the fuck out of here," Barks the guy in the passanger seat. "Yeah yeah," replies the driver as he pulls out, "You know where your drop point is?" "Yes."

"All right," Tengu replies, and flies the fake Shawntae over a building, before landing. "You take to the tunnel, while I start doing some alerting.'

Thomas drops to the ground, and gets well out of sight before letting his features restore themselves to their normal configuration. He's intimately familiar with his own biology, and to attempt to pass through solids with any shape but the one he's accustomed to is a thought that fuels his fears. Nevertheless he enters the ground, moving as swiftly as he possibly can.

The NPG have made it onto the roadways, and are now moving outwards. Another police band comes onto the radio. "Help- we're under fire here at the Downtown MCPD. The NPG are here laying waste. We need backup. I repeat, we need backup."

"Guys... MCPD is calling for backup. The NPG is laying waste to the police station. Anyone mind terribly if I go to assist them? Because, I think I'm going to." Guy seems to have made up his mind, still... it's best not to put the others in jeopardy...

In Darkglow's car, it goes for about two minutes, before slowing down. "Okay, Go!" Screams the driver, and the passanger leaps out, trashbag in hand. He ducks down between two buildings.

Into the tunnel drops Tom, once he's sure Shawntae himself isn't around. He runs for the bundled package of his armor, then skids to a stop, extending a hand. The kevlar unfolds itself and hovers eerily, wrapping itself around his body. _No time, no time..._ The helmet flows around his head, fitting itself snugly into place, and almost immediately part of the radio chatter can be heard. **Assist who?** he asks, having caught only three words.

"The MCPD. The cops. The Fuzz. The five-oh..." Guy rattles off as many synonyms as he can, before slipping between points in time, appearing one moment on the roof, and the next, near the station requesting backup.

Frowning a bit in curiosity, DarkGlow decides that he's had enough of motorized transport for now. The tracker he'd planted on the driver's belt will let the others know the driver's position--_And besides, alley hopping is really more my style anyway..._ A second later, he's in the alley behind car's former passenger.

The guy who jumped out is moving away from a dumpster in the alley, and keeps on moving, out the other side end of the alley.

Thomas sighs. _Useless.._ He flies upward, through the mass of intervening earth, navigating his way toward Guy's point of lookout. **Phase 1.5,** he announces to Guy, simultaneously copying to Tengu via radio. **We help the police, I suppose..**

The Downtown precient is a warzone. Or atleast, it sounds like it. Automatic fire and blasts of various technical weapons erupt from inside the building, peppering the squadcars and bunkered down officers for the firefight.

Darkglow follows the guy on foot, who once reaches the other side of the alley, takes a much more relaxed pace. He looks around, and then simply steps into a coffee shop.

Guy looks about rather intently. _Okay... a warzone. This is bad. There's the gun fire, there's the high-tech weapon fire... where're the purple gits... and how do I keep the cops from shooting at me?_ Almost instinctively, Guy speeds up, so that he's a blur of motion, while the world around him appears to slow down...

As Guy watches, a blast emits from the inside of the door. It rips through the cop car turned over, and he can see the police officer downed by the shot that pierced **through** his cover.

_Well that takes care of where they are. Okay... time to go kick butt and take names and chew bubble gum. Wait... no, I couldn't afford the gum. Blast._ Guy heads into the precinct.

Looking on from the mouth of the alley, DarkGlow frowns at the closed door of the coffee shop. _Dark alleys, no problem. Secret hideouts, check. But coffee shops...? That's just not playing fair..._ He blinks to a shaded area across form the shop, and tries to spot his quarry inside.

Inside is a disaster site. The desk clerk, Guy remembers seeing not two days ago, is unconcious and bleeding from the forehead, crumpled behind her desk. Immediate gunfire can't be heard anywhere else, except for two purple jacketed punks, one with an uzi, the other with an energy pistol. A third is further back in the room, standing in a doorway with a very nasty looking sniper rifle. "Did you see that? I plugged his ass! Right through the car! I'm keeping this," He intones, ducking further into the building. "Keep the cover coming; we're out," He calls.

The vigilante moves swiftly; unencumbered by fear when surrounded by the comforting immersion of solid matter, he feels most free to exert himself. This paradox sometimes amuses him, but for now it doesn't enter his thoughts. The Ghost practically leaps through the surface of the street, hands trailing out behind him, asphalt and pieces of damaged automobile swirling into them. His improvised weapons lash out as he lands, clipping the gun from the hands of a very surprised gunman.

Prey moves in mysterious ways. DG finds the quarry, who is ordering a cappechino.

_Come out, you bastard. Don't sit down, come out!_ DarkGlow prays.

Apparently, fate is not listening to DG. The guy sits down, glancing at his watch every three seconds, while blowing on his caffinated drink.

Guy steps instantly from the doorway to the hallway, appearing off to the side of the gunman who's just used his wicked-looking sniper rifle. He turns his hips while striking out in a defensive posture...

And the guy doesn't flinch. Well, he does, but Guy's fist thuds into his fortified leather jacket. "Shit." He backs up. "We have _Supers in the building! Move your asses!_" The echoing cry comes from the front room, where both of the gunmen take running leaps to get away from the Ghost Knight, the disarmed one leaving his Uzi behind. The sniper-rifler runs as well, moving towards a nearby window and simply hurling himself through it.

DarkGlow mutters to himself, "Target has entered coffee shop. Repeat, target has entered coffee shop. I'm going in--wish me luck. If I don't make it back, assume the capuccino is lethal... Yeah, real heroic." He leans against the nearest wall, scowling fiercely as he stares at the thug sipping from his cup. "You'll get yours later, buddy. Enjoy the drink, you'll not get many more..."

Thomas is faster. Where the thug has to worry about the window, and what's below it, the Ghost need merely pass through the wall. His improvised maces come with him, of course, and as the sniper attempts his escape, they flash out to knock the weapon from his hands. The skull leers sardonically as Tom regards his quarry. _They run from supers, even with weapons like this? Interesting._

Guy whirls about as he hears the footsteps of two men headed his way. His leg lashes out rapidly, a mere blur, really, as he drops down and knocks the legs out from both of his attackers. "Give up now, and ya won't get hurt... too bad..."

Guy's strike scores a spilling on both of their parts. The disarmed one rolls up to his feet, and keeps on moving, while the armed thug jumps to his feet. "Ow." He lifts his pistol, unleashing the blast.

Guy's quick enough to simply dodge, his speed and motion eat up the brunt of any sting from the weapon, which merely clipped him in the elbow. The guy Ghost Knight disarms panics. "Shit!" His hand ducks into his jacket, and pulls forward what looks like a yellow ball inside of a plexiglass covering. He jerks the pin, tossing it at his feet, and then Bolts. It bounces... and Tom is assaulted by a wave of vicious sound screaming from the little bomb, while a series of flashing snaps of light pop rapidly.

Thomas shuts his eyes, as he's dazzled by the blast; the piercing sounds assail his his senses. All that's left is his sense of perception, but it will be enough.... The Ghost launches himself forward, intending to put paid to the fleeing sniper.

Relying on his other senses, the Ghost Knight leaps after his attacker, and punches him square in the back of the head, sending him to the ground in a stunned stuper. His perceptive arc spies several people fleeing in various directions, from behind the station, so on.

The guy in the coffee shop removes a cellphone, and makes a call briefly. He checks his watch for the fifteenth time.

Guy's foot lashes out once more, this time hooking itself around the still armed thug. He picks his leg up swiftly, throwing the thug to the ground. In a flash his gun is trained on the guy's head. "I don't wanna have to shoot you... so give up... now..."

"Freeze!" A cop screams from the doorway, his gun trained on both Guy and the armed thug.

The punk looks up at Guy, then the officer, and sets his gun down. "Guess we can't call this a draw, huh?"

After a minute, DG's quarry hangs up the phone, and takes his coffee with him, walking outside.

Guy shakes his head. "We could call it a draw... if I hadn't won. How about we call it a sketch instead? Murphy here'll take good care of ya..." He stoops and picks up the gun, before disappearing between moments in time.

Guy has ported outside, and finds the Ghost Knight standing vigilant against a wall, while his offender is getting to his feet. And Guy makes sure he stays put, until an officer comes around the corner.

_Well, hello, there. Walkin' and drinkin' at the same time, huh? Hope you don't spill any of that lovely stuff..._ DarkGlow thinks. A shadow tentacle has already formed before he realizes that the thug is rather out of reach. With an aggrieved sigh, he allows the tentacle to dissipate and follows the man once more.

Guy points both guns at the ex-sniper. "Just stay put there for a minute..." He waits until the police officer comes around the corner, and indicates the thug. That's the one he's got the guns pointed at. He gives a wry grin, "Book'em Dano." _I've always wanted to say that... it's as cool as it sounds..._

Thomas is already gone; he has no intention of waiting around for any police officer. His objective is the discarded sniper rifle, packed with dire power; and taking it into his possession, he fades through the earth and away.

The punk leads DG on a merry stroll, atleast twelve blocks down, to a parked car on the side of the road. He unlocks it, climbs in, and drives. DarkGlow ports into the back seat, which is very spare on shadows but he gets in none the less. He also finds a backpack that looks very similar. The thug drives out to North Detroit, but goes a different way then Shawntae's place, and parks outside of an apartment building. He reaches back, claims the bag, and gets out, before getting out.

The member walks in, up two flights of stairs, then enters a cruddy apartment, dropping the stuff inside. "You here?" "Yeah," Calls a woman's voice from further inside. "Cool."
