DarkGlow, with much disgust on the lack of quality in his chase, slips into the shadows, and little trouble, arrives at Shawntae's apartment building. Though, he could have sworn he saw something move, within the shadows with him. With as much discresion as possible, the other team members filter around the building. Vanessa's waiting in the shadows of an alley one building down, on the opposite side of the street, keeping watch on Shawntae's window.

The team takes positions. With Guy posted a few teleporting jumps away, with full radio contact, the vigilant ghost situated in the building's basement, DarkGlow hunkered in the corner of the hallway leading to Shawntae's apartment, and Tengu is even positioned on a rooftop down the block. They wait.

Ten minutes after Darkglow has situated himself, the door across from Shawntae's apartment opens. The man inside, who looks a little shabby and shakey, takes one look at Shawntae's door, then walks down the hall, and down the stairwell.

DarkGlow cocks his head. _A lookout, maybe? Let's have a look ourselves, shall we?_ Concentrating, he locates a shadow in the newly vacated apartment, and invisibly steps out there.

Poor. That's the one thing that flashes into DarkGlow's mind as he steps into the apartment. It looks like something out of a movie of junkies. A matress on the floor, garbage... doesn't look great. Though DarkGlow finds the phone all right.

_Hmm... well, it's something to do, I suppose._ Glad he's wearing gloves, DarkGlow gingerly picks up the receiver and dials the same number identification service he'd called from the apartment overlooking the playground not so long ago. Replacing the phone in the cradle, he contacts Guy. "If you're bored, you might want to check out any calls made from this number. It's the guy across the way from Shawntae. Figured he might be a lookout or something." He repeats the number the identification service gave him.

"From this number?" He takes down the number. "Uhm... yeah, I suppose I can check out the calls made from this number." Guy sits up then, pondering. "Any date or time in particular you'd like me to see about finding?"

"Today would be good. Over the last few minutes would be better--he just left," DarkGlow replies.

Down the hall, there's a bathroom, and two bedrooms. From the corner of his eye, the shadowed one spots someone walk from the bathroom into a bedroom. It was too quick for him to get the details.

DarkGlow says "Later." curtly and quietly. Eyes narrowed, he seeks a shadow in the bedroom...

"Alright. Get back to the stakeout biz. Keep us informed." Guy then hangs up the phone, before dialing in another number. "Hello...? Yeah, I need to get a list of the last few calls made from this number, if I might..."

Suspecting someone else is in the apartment, DarkGlow spots a shadow inthe next room. Wishing he could shield himself while remaining invisible and teleporting, DarkGlow cautiously 'ports into the other room.Wishing he could shield himself while remaining invisible and teleporting, DarkGlow cautiously 'ports into the other room. Stepping into one, he steps out into the bedroom, and finds... nothing. No one.

"No calls made today. Freakin' waste of... hmmm, maybe if he checked on the last number called." Guy has taken to muttering to himself for the time being. _As long as I don't start arguing with myself, I should be reasonably sane._ He picks up the phone and dials DG again.

<+++Editor: Note, fix line 14; I tried to splice it and screwed up.>

Looking around the room in some consternation, DarkGlow answers the phone. "What?"

"Hey. Guy here. You may wanna check to see the last number that called the phone, 'cause aside from the time you called me, no calls were made."

DarkGlow is briefly amused. "You want me to use something as simple as 'last call return' to find out information? _Anyone_ could do that! What happened to being _superheroes_...?"

"Well... unless you have superpowers that let you... \*69 is probably the way to go." Informs Guy, trying his best not to chuckle into the phone.

DarkGlow gives an exaggerated sigh. "Oh, all right..." Then, more seriously, "Hold on a sec..." He returns to the main room and punches the not-so-magical combination into the phone.

The faint sound of trickling water is caught by DarkGlow's ears as he walks by the bathroom. Star 69 replies, "I'm sorry, but this number is unable to be given."

Frowning again, DarkGlow replaces the phone. To Guy he says, "No dice. It won't give me the number. Then again, why would anyone want to block their number from a lowlife like the guy who lives in this dump. Interesting, no?"

For some reason, the water seems more pronounced in DG's ear.

"Could be... but telemarketers normally don't give out their number. Nor do people with auto caller-id block. Or payphones. Just a thought. Maybe you should see about doing something different?" Asks Guy...

DarkGlow shrugs, though the other can't see it of course. "What can I say? I'm bored... I'm rather wanting the fit to hit the shan, so to speak. See you..." Hanging up, he eyes the bathroom door. _Bored... and getting a bit creeped out. There won't be anything there, naturally. If I was more of a team player, I'd go hang with Vanessa right now, but..._ He ports back to the hallway.

And it goes like that. Nothing happening for several hours. Until Guy's phone rings. "Guy? This is Van. I've been seeing this guy walk in, and out of the building, around the front of the building, then back inside several times. He looks like he's hiding the fact he's watching the place, and doing a bad job."

"Yeah? What's the guy look like?" Guy speaks up, glad for a relief from the terrible boredom of report preparing. "Should I pop over? I'll inform the rest of the crew, right now. Unless you have anything else to add?"

"Black guy, looks kinda thin, dirty clothes. About six feet, I could guess. Wearing a white tanktop." Van clucks her tongue. "Nope, nothing to add. Don't port on over yet. Call Ghost Knight, get his thoughts?"

"Thanks." Guy then hangs up and calls GK. "Hey... Guy here. There's a thin dirty guy, six feet tall, wearing a bad tank top, doing a bad job of watching the place. From what DG's told me, he's not been inside yet. He's seen the door open, seen someone take a look at the door, and head out. This could be our bum from across the hall?"

**Has he seen inside?** is GK's first question. **If so, he may suspect something is amiss. Our retrieval of ... Shawntae ... hinted at a planned operation but not provably so. If the observer goes inside, we will act.**

Sure enough, an hour later - 1 PM - the guy goes inside. With GK's observation, the man is loitering just inside the door, before DarkGlow spies him wandering up the steps.

Thomas rises upward, through layers of earth and stone, carefully maneuvering himself to one of the half-emptied bedrooms of Shawntae's old apartment. He settles in, quiet as he can manage, and waits.

Darkglow spies the guy wander down the hall, take a glance at Shawntae's door, then walk into his place.

_Something or nothing..._ With a shrug, DarkGlow flits through the shadows and appears back inside the man's apartment, to invisibly watch his activites.

He's dialing on his phone. "Hey, man. They ain't showed." A pause. "Yeah, I know, but I's hungry. Sorry, sorry! But this is a long time to wait, man. Yeah. What? You don't think day be coming? Whynot? Day not at school? Oh. You still want me tah watch the place? A'ight. I still gettin' my money? A'ight. When can I stop? A'ight." He hangs up, walks to the bathroom.

_Something, then. Our intrepid leader might find this information useful..._ DarkGlow 'ports back to his corridor hiding spot, and contacts GhostKnight.

Thomas chuckles at the news. **We deck him, take the phone, redial, and I'll report that the family returned in an unmarked vehicle. That should elicit some action... let's go.**

"Well, if you're sure we must press into action..." DarkGlow begins, but has teleported back into the apartment before finishing the statement, rather hoping to beat the other to the semi-metaphorical punch.

The toilet flushes, and the observer walks out of his bathroom, heading to the door. And like a bad dream, the Ghost Knight slides through the wall. With little trouble, the two of them subdue the man.

Figuring killing the man would be a bad idea--in front of skullface, anyway--DarkGlow contents himself with keeping his body wrapped securely, and his mouth pinned shut. Alas, the man can still breathe, if not overly well. DarkGlow then watches GhostKnight's performance with interest.

Once the man is safely secured, thanks to DarkGlow's tireless and not a little sadistic methods of restraint, the Ghost puts his gloved hand on the handset and lifts it to his \`head'. Gloved fingers stab down, pressing the REDIAL button, and ears grow keen as he listens for those all-important tones, the audible evidence that's the next footprint on the trail the vigilante and his friends are tracking. He waits patiently.

After a second, a voice comes on the other line. "Hello?"

The voice sounds familiar; Enaro.

Thomas speaks, his voice as good a match as he can manage for the captive the team now guards. "They pulled up! Black car, dun' look like no cops, but they's here! Whatcha want me to do?"

There's a pause. "I want you to go outside, and wait for us. When we show up, you show us which car."

Thomas twists the voice into as much disbelief as he dares. "What? The Lexus, man! It's the only car nobody around here can afford! What you want me to show you, huh? I... shit, it's leavin!.... no, wait, they's still here. Hey, they left some stuff behind. Think they gonna get a van here or somethin?"

There's a growl into the phone. "Damnit. When'd he get a new car? Just show us what car it is when we get there. Do what you can to slow him down without being stupid. You'll get more money." Click.

Thomas gently places the receiver back on its cradle, and retrieves his own phone. **Guy, I have a phone number I want you to investigate....** He thinks for a moment, then recites the digits that should correspond to the sounds he heard. **Get what you can on it. We are expecting company soon.**

"Okay. I'll see if I can find out the number for ya. Hmmm." Guy chuckles to himself. "Anything else I need to do?"

DarkGlow says, "So they're sending in the calvary, huh? Good. Pity they're gonna get ambushed by outlaws--just to continue the metaphor, of course." He grins briefly.

Thomas nods, then turns his attention to the captive. **You'll talk or die,** he says, the briefest and plainest of threats possible. **Nod to talk. Shake your head to die.**

His eyes are about as wide as half dollars. He nods. As much as DG will let him.

DarkGlow feels his lips stretch in amusement--he's spoken those sames words a time or four. _Maybe he does have in in him, after all._ He considers a moment longer. _Eh, probably not. Who's gonna shake his head to **that** face?_

Thirty minutes later, they arrive. Three of them. DarkGlow and Ghost Knight are warned. At DG's porting, spying, the three of them are loitering inside their car, looking around for the watchout. He pegs two of them who were at the City Center.

Leaving the prisoner bound in the sewers, the Ghost rises upward, doing the only thing he can really do at the moment. He enters the watcher's apartment via his customary ghostlike movement, and a few moments later, helmetless, presents his captive's visage at the window, as though the man were home, but unwilling or unable to leave. Then he disappears from outside view again, re-donning his helmet and feeling himself grow shaky, sweaty, and very cold.

A minute passes. The phone rings in the little apartment.

Thomas answers it. "I think they saw me," he whispers into the receiver in his proxy's voice. "Better move it before they see you guys out there and call the cops! Hurry up!"

"Saw you do what? Hurry your ass down here. We shoot them now, someone hears, and they call the cops."

Thomas speaks into the phone. "I'll try, but I-mmmph!" Quickly he bangs the receiver down on its cradle, grabbing his own cell phone and transmitting in its "party line" mode: "Get them! On the street! Now!" Between the shock of such rapid and unprepared face-morphing and the stressful demands of the current situation, Tom neglects to use his alter-ego's sepulchral voice, but he doesn't think about it at the moment. He's too busy leaping for the wall, and the street beyond.

DarkGlow emerges crouching from behind the car--quite visible to anyone in the street, but not to anyone inside. His blade quickly slashes both rear tires.

There's a flurry of activity inside the car. The engine starts, before the fact of the flattening tires apparently dawns on the participants inside. The passanger side pushes open, the guy jumping forward and turning around, a sawed off in hand, toward the back of the car. The driver and back seater both push out the same time, the backseater turning toward the back of the car, while the front man turns to spot the Ghost Knight. "We need to run. Now."

_Shotguns... nasty things. Never liked them..._ Shadows flow from under the car and solidly entangle the thug. _Unless the gunman can't use one, of course. Then they're kinda picturesque. He'll keep.. who's target two?_

Thomas leaps through the side of the apartment, lunging outward to the street. He lands in a crouch, hands instantaneously opening to receive the flow of concrete into them, and as he takes three remaining steps toward the car a pair of maces made from the very street are in his hands. They offer the driver a punishing blow that leaves him reeling..

The strike earns a crumpling from the guy. He's knocked off his feet, and against the building itself. He's not unconcious, but he's not about to stand up and do anything about it at this moment either. The be-wrapped gunner writhes and shouts, trying to pull out of the shadowy prison.

From across the street, lightning erupts in an angry line of zigzagging sparks. It dances across the top of the car, shattering the window and peeling paint as it passes. Luckily, target ducks, earning him some hair standing on end.

Guy appears between two ticks of the clock. His every movement is speeded up as he looks about, ready to confront... whatever it is he's gone and gotten himself into. _What have I gotten myself into this time..._

The car's interior becomes lighter as the shadows race to cover the other thug heading for the back of the car. He glances at his first target and, satisfied the restraint is holding, deliberatly looks the wreckage lying on the ground next to the building, then at GhostKnight. "Thought you just wanted them captured. I suppose that's one--rather painful--way of doing it," he says, innocently. "Mind disarming them?"

**First their weapons. Then we take them inside the other guy's apartment,** says GK, moving to do just that..

Guy blinks a bit... "So what do we do then... uh... well... looks like we handled that quite amiably. Is there anyone else around? What about the guy who was watchin' the place?"

DarkGlow nods. "For transport, restraints with a little more... substance would be in order."

Thomas frowns. **He's underground, I'll bring him up through the manhole in a few minutes.**

In short order, the three are unconcious, unarmed, and thoroughly bruised and battered. They are then carried up to the watcher's apartment, their guns safely stashed elsewhere.
