# Millennium City Chronicles 2003-06-24

The Wednesday afternoon is rather cheerful. Clear skies, birds chirping. Not the most apt atmosphere, for just inside the home of the CEO and owner to Yamaguchi Corp, rising from the floor, is the Ghost Knight. The house is relatively quiet, though with the Knight's extra senses, can detect the occasional person milling about. Two people are on the second floor, one door from the stairwell not far from his position. And off he goes.

Lydon is in his personal study, looking over papers, while no doubt his butler is idly by, doing... something. Of course, as the Knight steps through the door, it takes both men only moments to react. The butler starts, and reaches for his belt. "Percival!" Lydon calls, standing up from his desk. "This is... the Ghost Knight. He works for me." Percival gives a nod. "You should have knocked, sir."

Thomas tosses a shapeless lump of electronics and plastic onto the desk, then stands back, folding his arms. **These are now useless,** he announces coldly. **Find a more secure solution for communications, if you wish my continued services.**

Lydon stares at the lump, giving it a testing poke, before looking up. "What happened?"

The vigilante actually smiles, fleshless teeth pulling back in that almost-blasphemous leer they sometimes adopt. A moment passes, and the conversation from earlier begins emanating from some unseen source, filling the air of the room, every nuance of two voices reproduced verbatim.

Lydon frowns deeply at that. "All right." He sits back down, and thinks a second. "Okay... The first thing that comes to mind is a high frequency radio, but if someone catches the frequency, then that is useless." He leans back. "There is the potential for satelite transition, but the problem with that is, certain areas may not get the transmission due to distraction."

**Frequency agility is a technique used by your military, and will address the first issue,** suggests the Ghost. **What you really need is a mobile transmitter, reasonably well-defended, that can be moved as circumstances warrant. I know of.. someone... who may be able to help in this regard. Until then, do you require me for anything further?**

This Lydon considers. "A mobile transmitter? Huh." A nod after a moment. "No, I don't thin-" He stirs slightly, and reaches into his pocket, extracting a vibrating cellphone. "Hello?"

Tia's voice kicks in, "Tengu! Is this Tengu? I have information... Help.... "

Lydon simply blinks. "Excuse me? Who is this?"

Tia says, "I.. I.. I just need your help," A low, confused voice speaks in the phone, desperate, "Please.. Tengu."

"Okay, okay. Wait. Where are you? What do I need to look for?"

Tia speaks tersly, "There's a green sign infront of me that says 'Parks Avenue'. I'm near some water. There's a red building across the street. They are serving food below me. I'm a chrome metallic color."

The sound of metal squealing enters the phone, before the line clicks off. "Damnit." Lydon looks up to Ghost Knight, before tossing him the cellphone. "Find DarkGlow, find anyone else. Tengu needs to be on Parks Avenue right now." _This very well may be a trap but... I don't know._ "Look for someone with chrome skin." He's already moving from behind his desk towards the door. "And hurry."

Thomas snags the phone in midair, wasting no time in dialling DarkGlow's own number.

Lydon is speeding down the stairs. It doesn't enter into his mind that Ghost Knight may wonder how he may be alerting Tengu's 'driver'. But no need to ask such questions.

A touch of startlement at the sudden vibration on his hip causes the elderly-seeming man on the park bench to twist sideways, before he realizes it's merely his phone. _I thought I had the day off..._ he thinks, sourly. A half-eaten chicken-salad sandwich is tossed carelessly onto its wrapper beside him, and one hand reaches for his phone while the other tugs his black baseball cap lower over dirty-white hair. "'lo?" he gets out around his last bite, before swallowing and clearing his mouth.

**Meet Tengu at Parks Avenue at best speed,** the dead voice asserts. **Be mindful for someone with metallic or reflective skin,** it adds, before the phone clicks dead. This much, at least, is growing somewhat traditional.

DarkGlow sighs and replaces the phone on his hip. He stuffs the last of his lunch into his mouth and, struggling to chew on the overly large bite, wads up the wrapper and tosses it at the garbage can beside his bench. _A hero's gotta be kind to the environment, right?_ The last of his juice eases his throat after a painful swallow, and the box follows the wrapper. Hoisting a black knapsack onto slightly stooped shoulders, he heads for the nearest shadowed spot to don his cloak and get back into action. _Is it wrong to hope that this time it'll be bloody...?_ In the shadows, he sighs again and disappears.

The Theater district houses some of the most trendy clubs, the best entertainment in town, and atleast one or two swanky places to dine. However, at the moment, it is the battleground for a small war being raged. A shadow blossoms to release the nightstalker onto the street-level. Flashes of light draw across a rooftop, the sounds of yelling find his ears.

DarkGlow's eyes track the sounds. _Right spot, it seems. So... who's the target? Metal-boy?_

Tia's head darts around, looing for something as her body responds automatically to her attacker's efforts. One grab, and a twist later, and an attacker plummets off the trendy and into the trash. She peers at her attackers, and takes a leap across an alley, to anothe rrooftop, and looks back across. Her metal body shines in the atrnoon light with it's silver, metallic glow.. She is still looking, but doesn't seem to find what she wants.

The men on the rooftop - from what she can tell atleast wearing kevlar beneath their nondescript uniforms - are not the worst of her worries. No. The sound of small rockets draw to her attention, before a hunk of metal in humanoid form draws up from the alley's gap. "There you are," Calls the voice from within. "You're a slippery bitch." A powersuit. It's obvious by the visor protecting where the head would be.

_Fun's up top, right..._ DarkGlow thinks, before his mind locates a shadow cast by a ventilator on a rooftop. He steps out there and assesses the situation.

Tia peers over at the armored suit. Her head tilts up and down. Bitch... She barks at the unit, Extending her arm, she charges the unit.

Tia leaps across the alley, her arms extended to try and catch the armored suit in it neck. Her leap is just a bit poorly timed, and she crashes with the chest instead, she spins back, ad she lands on the opposite rooftop, facing her opponent, crouched on the ground.

The strike doesn't seem to phase - or even slow the individual. "Ow. That really hurt." This is followed up with the charging blaze of one fist, before a beam of energy crackles outwards, clawing across the pavement. Beautifully crafted reflexes work counter, the landing not having caused a touch of hesitation; Tia dances from the blast with ease.

DarkGlow glances at the metallic opponents struggling, and decides to leave them to it. _Besides, the metal thing I tangled with ripped through my entanglements ridiculously easily. Goons with guns, on the other hand... Lethal things guns. Might just have to take off the kid gloves..._ He spots one carelesly close to the roof's edge. _Hope he doesn't slip... or that he has a parachute_ He grings nastily. The shadows of a few of the thug's compatriots merge into a dark streak on the surface of the roof, and then promptly lashes out.

Neither a parachute nor the grace of having trash beneath does the gunman have. His fall is broken by the ground, three stories down, with a sickening **smack**.

Three objects briefly appear at the apex of the billboard overlooking one of the rooftops, above the assembled gunmen. One is a black-clad body capped with a leering skull, eyesockets narrowed in contempt, that drops to the roof. Underneath its feet, the groaning rooftop splits and cracks with the force of impact. The other two objects follow - two halves of one of the beams that supports the billboard above, shaped into blunt instruments of pain and falling neatly into both of the Ghost's outstretched hands. From his crouch he leaps into motion, swinging his borrowed weapons with dire result.

One attack, leaving the man reeling and clutching the ground. The reciever of the second, a pace away, leaves him unconcious on the ground. All attention seems to be focused for a moment on the Ghost Knight, and for a moment, seven of the visible men hesitate. Only one has the gonads to lift his weapon and fire.

The attach leaves nary a scratch on the leering skull. Despite the sting of the impact, it earns no pain. "Da-mn." Comments the metal-suited wonder off to the side. "Guess you're not here to help."

Tia remains in her croush, she barks a few more times at the machine, keeping a wary eye on it.

Turning back to Tia, it regards her a moment. "Grenade her," He calls out, and flies a good fifteen feet above the roof, before one of the arms comes forward. A box attached to it lights up, before a canister blasts from it, rocketing quickly towards the android's feet.

The blast doesn't do much; the wary android ducks out of the way as concrete goes flying from where she once stood; the force, the flying shrapnel do little more then scratch the surface. "Huh. Well tha-" His words are cut off as he relatively disappears from sight into the alley, where a rumbling **crack** resounds on the ground. "You called for Tengu?" Echos a voice from above.

DarkGlow eyes the flashy arrival of the skullface, but discards the idea of emulating it in the future. _I'd have 10 slugs in me if I tried it, I bet. Doesn't look like I'll be pushing them all off the roof, either. Pity..._ Instead, the shadow of the man who'd fired fruitlessly at GhostKnight flows up and embraces the gunman like a long lost brother--and doesn't let go.

Spinning on one foot, Tom brings his truncheons down swiftly onto the shoulders of one unprepared thug. The second, who looks better trained, catches two poles at the neck and ribs respectively, but in the time he wastes downing his middle target, the last one has time to shake himself free of his stunned state and move out of the way.

Now they're acting more organized. The shadow-gripped individual brings his gun down, and burns through it. "We have supers on the roof!" He screams out. The remaining three begin to retreat, especially the one facing down Ghost Knight. However, one removes a grenade from his belt, and hurls it at the android. Electricity sparks in the air, before the crackling cascade of electricity rips through the air.

And once more, she is out of the way. Simply the **closeness** of the electricty earns a slight chrispness to her circuitry. "Get the stronger ones!" Yells the man who cut himself loose from the shadows, before retreating. Tengu pins him down, before turning to Tai. "How did you know to call-" Two rockets compact against Tengu, bits of metal flying in different directions, as the other suiter reamerges.

Now that it'd no longer be suicide to step out of cover, DarkGlow rises and sprints at the nearest gunman--the one with a fondness for grenades. Shadows harden into armour around him, and his hand tingles as the Shade's Blade envelops it. The thugs stares for a second at the entrance of this 'new' combatant, and turns toward DarkGlow just enough that instead of cutting into his unprotected side, the blade has to cut through Kevlar. The thug grunts, but doesn't fall.

Tia shifts backwards, growling at the cowardly battlesuit, and she backs away, on all fours, keeping the suit in visual sight at all times.. she rests a bit, and sighs.

Throwing away his improvised weapons, the Ghost crouches between two crumpled bodies, snatching up the grenades they carried. He thrusts his hands forward, and from them the two spheres of bottled death leap forward and up. Their pins clatter to the rooftop mid-way, and at the end of their flight, they're left hovering a mere foot from the visored head of the foreign battlesuiter...

Boom. Like bottled lightning, archs of electricity flare outward. Tengu takes the opportunity to come screaming in from above just as the dust clears, shifting legs upwards to allow for a slashing down of taloned strike.

The suiter's jets click off for a brief second, allowing him to drop out of the air for just a moment, enough to let Tengu's grasp clank over his head. Then those rockets kick fully into propulsion, drawing him up into the air and behind the winged hero. Hands press into Tengu's back, angling downward and **flying**, before the flare of blasting energy propels Tengu straight into the ledge, smashing, before disappearing beneath the lip. This unfortunately leaves the annonymous suiter hovering seven or so feet above the alley. "That's what I thought," He comments, attention shifting down into the gaping hole, before turning to the rooftop individuals. "The others'll take care of him. Who's next?"

Grimly, DarkGlow bats aside one of his opponent's arms, and again stabs deeply into him. The blackness under his hood clears momentarily to reveal eyes narrowed and blazing.

The blade darts in, and cuts right along the goon's pelvis. His leg crumples, as well as he drops the gun, and is not going to be reaching for it anytime soon, is for sure.

Tia leaps across the gap again at the suiter pops up into range. She connects, running her fist through the armor as she jumps to the opposing rooftop again, snarling at the metal contraption as she passes by.

The powersuiter snarls as the stroke sways him. "Damn you," He hisses, and flies above her, higher this time, to avoid any attacks like that. Meanwhile, a rain of missiles draws downward behind her; the first one hitting the ground after she darts out of the way, but only her agility saves her - that and rolling with the explosive force of the bombardment.

Ghost Knight sinks down into the building, before pushing out of the wall and falling down into the alley below. Tengu's atleast standing, but several nasty dents and pieces have fallen to the ground. Atleast one man is crouched at the end of the alley, roughly ten paces away, firing Tengu while he struggles. No doubt the result of the smoking leg. A voice familiar to the Knight calls up. "Help me."

Thomas takes three long strides, brick and metal accumulating in two hands as they glide roughly along the wall of the building. One fully-formed mace smashes into the gunman's head, and another follows, crashing into his chest.

He's uprooted from his position, tumbling backwards several feet. Several goons round the corner, however, though they aren't there yet. "I have to shut the suit down. DarkGlow would be **very Handy** right now for shielding," Tengu's voice spews forth, as it rocks back. Gravity manipulates the shattered pieces into place, before the airlock system hisses open.

Casting a contemptuous glance at the cowering and unconscoius wreckage that GhostKnight left in his wake, DarkGlow spins and launches a web of shadow at the metal flier before any missiles fall his way. He doesn't have much hope of tangling him up for long, but maybe the other metal one can do something in the meantime...

Tia stands up and catches her breath. She stands up, and brushes herself off.. not really seeing the suiter anymore, she looks conusedly at the other folks come to her aid.

The blob of darkness that was the suiter shakes. "Hey! What's this? Damnit!" After a second, "Okay. Radar initiated." The darkness draws towards DarkGlow. "That was not funny."

The suit begins to hiss and retract across the body of the suiter. After a moment, Lydon bares himself. "Ghost Knight, do me a favor? Get me the hell out of here?"

DarkGlow takes a bare moment to stare blankly at the lack of action from the metal figure on the roof. _What the hell are you doing? Tanning? This is combat!_ He wrenches his attention to the other metal-clad figure floating toward him. _'Funny'? I note you haven't broken free yet. Too late..._ At his command, a tentacle of shadow flies up and grabs the figure, then physically pulls him down to the level of the roof--next to the other one. _Here, have some fun yourself..._ he thinks, bitingly.

At range, his powers are fairly limited; but up close, or even no further than a touch, Tom's ability to extend his aura into any material substance at all and mold it at will is unparalleled. The alley's material flows like water away from the slightest touch of his gloved fingers, parting like the Red Sea to permit him and Tengu -- no, Lydon -- passage into the depths of Millennium City's underground.

Tia looks at the present she's presented, and pulls back her fingers, each becoming a blade, she trusts her hand, finger first, through the figure's neck.

The darkness earns her target off just a touch. The sound of sparks and scraping is heard. The darkness parts as shadows erupt from the suiter. Though he's not active for a second. "Damnit. Resistance is coming. They're going to get you, you slick little bitch. See you." The sound of a kiss, before the rockets draw him back, and down into the alley. Then a sharp turn, down the street to dart out of sight. For a big clunk of metal, he's agile.

DarkGlow's jaw clenches painfully as the suited flier both casually rips apart his shadowy web and breaks free from his grasping tentacle. That would have been bad enough, but what really gets to DarkGlow is the fact that he immediately flies off, far too fast to again be caught up in shadow. "Bastard," he actually whispers, staring impotently after the figure. He whips around to face the gunmen, expression savage and blood pounding in his head, but those not unconscious are running as fast as they can. _Not faster than shadow, though..._ DarkGlow thinks, but it's little comfort as he imprisons them and he begins walking slowly in their direction.

The Ghost Knight rockets up through the earth, paralleling the tunnel he just dug. He emerges near the alley, passing through the wall of the building and sliding silently up through the surface of the roof. Inwardly, he blinks a few times, for things seem to have quieted down remarkably. **DarkGlow,** he calls curtly, then turns to regard the object of the party's search, the artificial being beyond.

Tia stands up, and looks around the area. She doesn't seem overly stressed or concerned, but she doesn't seem to know what to do now. She just stands there, looking around.... "Where..." She begins.

They're not putting up a lot of fight. The ones that are concious are struggling against the bonds. Their guns are of little use, either pinned under bodies, dropped, or discarded when fleeing. Sirens are heard in the distance, drawing like a banshee's wail over the settling dust.

**We came to help you. Now you will come with us, to explain why,** says the Ghost, addressing the artificial warrior. **DarkGlow, we should meet at the warehouse. These--** he waves an arm, encompassing the thugs in its sweep **\-- the police can handle.**

Tia looks at Ghost. She simply stares, and prepares to follow Ghost. Easy, that. She doesn't look threatening, or see any problem with following. "Yes."

Darkness coats and extends beyond DarkGlow's hands ending in an edge finer than any razor. As he nears his shadow-entangled victims, his head lowered and lips drawn back, the sound of the police sirens cuts through the blackness in his head and he jerks around in an old reflex. He crouches, scanning for an escape, when he sees GhostKnight and remembers what he's supposed to be pretending to be. It's fortunate that the skull isn't regarding him in that moment before he straightens and dismisses his blades. Words flow over him. What...? Oh... "Warehouse. Sure."

In the distance, the signs of the Champions drawing closer, faster, then the police.
