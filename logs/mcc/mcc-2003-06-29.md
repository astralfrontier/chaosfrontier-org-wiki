# Millennium City Chronicles 2003-06-29

DarkGlow steps out of shadow and into another of a very long series of obscured alleyways. He looks around blankly, vaguely aware that he's supposed to be heading somewhere that's on neither end of the narrow passage between two mouldering buildings he finds himself beside. His right wrist itches, and he scratches at it idly. A motion catches his eye and a careless flick of a strand of shadow smashes apart a pile of rotting garbage. A rat, thus exposed, flees deeper into the darkness. DarkGlow stares after it as it disappears, reminded that this is what he does so often--flee into welcoming shadow.

_Where am I supposed to be?_ He turns, and heads to the mouth of the alley. A dingy row of apartment buildings face him, grim even in the light of day. He doesn't recognize the area. _Is this home?_ He shakes his head, thoughts uncertain. _Was I going home?_ He steps out of the alley and glances around, but a shaft of sunlight glances off glass and spears his eyes. He stumbles back and again the shadows welcome him.

_Not home._ He's still uncertain. Thoughts merely crawl through his skull, almost randomly, connections unknown and unmade. If only he could focus... But he can't. If he let's his attention be drawn away from-- _Away from what?_ 'S funny. He's forgotten what he's trying to not think about. _Well, mission successful, then. Job well done._ His right wrist itches.

He finds another bank of shadows, and steps through to it. Another alley. It's contents are slightly different. It's ends reveal scenes that are much the same. Was this better? Is he any closer to his destination? He checks the time, looks watch on his left arm. Numbers blink at him. He reads them but they mean nothing. Was he late? He'd better get moving.

Another shadow, another alley. Here? No, probably not. _No sense jumping around if you don't know where you're going, I guess..._ The base of one of the enclosing walls is free of anything... objectionable. He slides down it, bonelessly, cloak catching and pulling free of the rough brick. Knees draw up to chest automatically. He hugs them tight, ignores the itching on his wrist.

A vibration on his hip. For a second he thinks that it's another itch, but it's pulsing most insistently. His brows draw down. _It's my cell phone. Why didn't I know it was my cell phone?_ And with that thought his hand goes automatically to his hip and draws it from its holder. Thumb hits button instinctively. A voice issues forth.

**DarkGlow? Where are you? We're--**

He knows that voice. He's heard it in variations from it's normal low and sinister rumble, to a rough and ready street thug's banter, to a scared kid's strained tones. The last only once, however, and somehow the most natural. Had he sounded like that once? Oh, most certainly. There was lot to be scared of in the home, when you were the one in the corner, off by yourself. Until Sasha, anyway. Sasha--

"_NightStar!_" her harsh voice demanded in his head. "_Not Sasha! And you're not Daniel! Stop answering to it!_"

"Right," he mutters. "Sorry..." He didn't like it when her voice sounded like that. She was showing him how to be strong, but of course she was still stronger than he was. But it didn't really matter. Together they could fight all the ones that had hurt her and hurt him. They could even ki--

No. No, best not to think about that. He might be reminded of--_guns and grenades_\--of things he doesn't want to--_shining metal bodies_\--to remember. There's still a buzzing in his ear. The phone is still on...

"DarkGlow." The voice is unfamiliar. No, wait... like the stirring inside a dark, dark sea, he recalls. Bright lights. Threats. "This is you know who. You have some new orders."

A hand clenches. Plastic creaks.

The phone isn't broken yet. He doesn't have that strenght, or hasn't started really breaking it. "DarkGlow," The voice says again. "Answer."

DarkGlow's throat closes tight. From base fear? From raging anger? "What?" he manages. It's more a croak than a word.

"You are to remain with the people you are currently with. However, you are to find out who is the operator of Tengu. Name and face."

"And kill hi--" The itch in DarkGlow's wrist sharpens into a burning. "--kill him, I suppose."

"No. Just find out who he is."

DarkGlow blinks, surprised. "Fine," he says, in lieu of a witty retort or ironic drawl.

"You will be contacted when you do." Click. No one on the other line.

The phone drops from a nerveless hand. He closes his eyes--defiance or weariness?--but his wrist, his damnable wrist, demands attention. Casually he slams it back-handed against the wall behind him. Pain replaces the itching, but also pierces the easy comfort of his clouded thoughts. Eyes open and sharp, he knows what he'll find as he pulls back his cloak's sleeve.

He scrapes at the blood with his leather-gloved hand, but the gesture is ineffectual. _Need to wash it off, I suppose._ He remembers the gunman folded over his arm, his shadow-encased hand puncturing the man's vitals. He remembers the one pushed off the roof--_Only three storeys, he may've survived..._. And he remembers promised violence against the final pair ensnared in his tangling shadows. He was going to eviscerate them, slice them belly to throat. Would have, too, if hte sirens hadn't sounded, if GhostKnight hadn't shown up again.

_GhostKnight..._ He stands, resettling his cloak, hiding stained flesh. The lit buttons of his phone's keypad catches his eye. He stares at it. _The warehouse. That's where I'm supposed to be going. And, yeah, I'm late._ He stoops to pick it up. _Think they'll fire me?_ His lips twitch at the thought. _GhostKnight... My 'benefactors'... What the hell am I gonna do?_

_Kill the controllers, of course._ he answers himself. _But for now, get your ass to the warehouse._

He vanishes into shadow.

Tia, accepting the offer, lets the Ghost Knight lead her down to the ground, and then further into the tunnel as the sirens rise around them like a shrieking wind. The stone melds back over itself as the Knight passes down, and into the safe tunnels below, where Lydon waits. From that tunnel they take a left, and continue on until arriving at the warehouse. Lydon had requested that an office or three be vacated for the use of this purpose until a better place was found, but the warehouse is still in use by the company; it would look too suspicious if he had the entire place cleared. Vanessa is waiting. She gives Tia a curious eyeing, but says nothing otherwise.

Thomas travels silently, thinking over the troubling implications of what he just saw and heard. Then, too, there is the question of this newcomer... why the sudden rush on Tengu's part? What's really going on?

Tia follows along, looking at her surroundings, the new woman, the strange new sites. She gives no outward signs of fear, surprise, or doubt, however.

Lydon looks a little shaken, annoyed, a lot of things. He casts his gaze around for a few moments. "We're missing some people." "I'll call DarkGlow," Vanessa offers, and dials up the number. "DarkGlow? Where are you, We're--" She pauses, frowning, looking down at the phone. "He hung up."

Thomas frowns internally, but reflects nothing outside. **He will arrive in time,** the Ghost says, evenly. **In the meantime, you are...?** he asks, directing the question at Tia

Tia looks up at Thomas, "Tia" She says, simply. She quirks her head slightly, and then looks at Thomas again, "I'm an android. I'm told they arn't common."

Lydon watches Tia for a second, and takes a seat at the table, folding his arms across the top of it. "Tia," He questions, "Who built you?"

Tia looks over at Lydon. After a second, she replies. "Steve Burner." She answers simply. Her pauses are strange, it seems she is being prompted by.. someone or something, as to what to say.

This doesn't seem to satisfy the man. "Steve Burner..." A shake of his head, frustration written on his face, but he doesn't immediately ask anything more. Vanessa hangs back, as if unsure what to... do here.

**Who is Steve Burner?** asks the Ghost, supplying the obvious question. **What is his profession, and who is his employer?**

Tia takes a while to respond.. no empotion is betrayed on her face, but the response must be causing some conflict. She speaks to Ghost again, turning her head, "He's a scientist. He says he worked for some very bad people."

Thomas eyes Lydon for a moment, considering, then returns his attention to this enigma. **You are in communication,** he says, stating simple fact. **Either he will need assistance as well, or he does not wish to leave wherever it is he is now. Further explanation is required.**

Lydon frowns further, and is about to say something before Ghost Knight beats him to it. He sits back and crinkles his brows.

Tia blinks for a second, then interjects. "He is dead." Another pause... "He is inside of me. But he is dead."

Vanessa blurts out, "His brain is in you?"

Tia looks over at the woman, "Not physically. But..." She pauses again, "A copy of his... his brain pattern is .. etched in mine." She stumbles a few times.

Thomas again glances toward Lydon and Vanessa. He himself pauses, digesting this startling revelation.

Lydon shakes his head again, looking rather irritated, though at something in the air. "Okay. So, how did you know to call private number, how did you know to ask for Tengu?" He asks, leaning forward pointedly. "Who told you to call?"

Tia blinks for a second. The answer takes a while, "I don't know." She says.

**In any event,** adds GK, **You should be comparatively safe here. If you are damaged, I may be able to help; if there are computational issues you need resolving, we know.. someone.. who may be able to provide aid.**

Lydon just nods with building frustration, but takes a deep breath. "All right. You said on the phone that you had information. What is it?"

Tia stays seated and answers simply, "I seem fine." She does to.. only minor cosmetic scratches on her form. She turn to Lydon. "I don't know."

DarkGlow steps from a darkened corner. "Eh, that's all right. Rescuing dam-- err... machines in distress is all part of the job description." Tension in his voice belies his carefree words, however.

"Personally, I'm more interested in the suit tossing rockets around," DarkGlow continues. "You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?"

A long, low sigh from Lydon, before he gets up and starts pacing. A glance at the bracer on his arm sustaining the suit, before crossing arms behind his back. A glance to the shadow manipulator as he arrives. "Whoever he was, he did a nasty bit of work on Tengu."

DarkGlow scowls, but the expression is hidden. The carefree words return. "How is the old fella?"

Tia turns to DarkGlow, and responds simply, "No. I don't know him either."

A sideglance from Lydon. "Damaged. I'll be neating to repair it before the suit is operational again."

DarkGlow nods. "Repairs... plus a few upgrades, I think. Tengu doesn't seem to have much luck going up against fellow mechanicals." He shrugs sympathetically and looks around. "He in a repair bay then?"

There is only a moment of hesitation. "Yes. Not here though; I would not have the suit where anyone could just stumble across it."

DarkGlow simply says, "Good." _Intersting phrasing, though._ He returns his attention to Tia. "What _do_ you know then? And, failing that, what do you want, besides health, long life, and so on?"

Tia looks over at DarkGlow, "Steve says I want revenge." She pauses. "I want... nothing." She pauses, "For now."

"Revenge... who doesn't, on someone?" DarkGlow asks, rhetorically. "But does Steve say on who? Revenge minus a target is rather... unsatisfying." _As I should know, damn it all._

Tia replies quickly, "His wife. But he uses more explitives."

**For the moment, you should stay with us,** counsels GK gravely, **Whoever called for us obviously thought you needed support. We may be able to provide answers to your questions in time, and you may be of considerable use to us as well.**

Tia looks over to Ghost, "Accepted." She says simply. But she doesn't move.

"The wife?" DarkGlow lets out a quick chuckle. "Glad we've got our very own gumshoe on retainer. He should have lots of practice in domestic disputes."

Lydon pipes up after a moment. "We have someone who may be able to look... into you. Into your ah... memory banks." The words are kind of struggled for, for lack of better words. "To find out what's going on in side, if you will. Perhaps to help find the answers?" Of course, half of this is said while looking at Ghost Knight.

**The other half of those answers will come from the police station. DarkGlow, the goons we downed must have been apprehended. Feel like coming with me to see what story the police squeezed out of them?** asks the Ghost.

Tia blinks for a second. "I think..." She pauses. "It should be alright... Steve is less willing. But answers are important."

DarkGlow looks at GhostKnight. "'Squeezed out of them'?" He coughs. "I prefer 'peeled like a grape' as a euphemism, but sure. Open or stealthy?"

GK's eyesockets narrow. **Stealthy. I sincerely doubt we can walk into the precinct building and simply ask to see their latest suspects' interrogation report.**

Lydon tips his head a second, before scooting out the chair. "Ghost Knight, before you head out, I have something I need to tell you privately."

DarkGlow taps a couple of pockets. "Yeah, I left my 'Certified Hero' badge in my other cloak, anyway." He glances at Lydon. _Best not be too curious._ "I'll be outside."

Nodding, GK follows Lydon..

Tia remains seated, as noone has stipulated her presence. She looks very pensive. Of course, she generally looks pensive..

Lydon leads Ghost Knight into the next room, closing the door. "Seal the sound off, please," He requests. He does not look nervous. Cautious, yes.

Thomas raises a gloved hand, clenching it into a fist. **It is done. Speak.**

Vanessa crosses over to Tia, and smiles. "Hi. I'm Van." She holds out her hand to the robot.

"I don't trust her." Lydon says immediately. "Not fully. She knew the number. She knew the name. We walked into a fire fight with **someone** who was well equipped. I can't see any ties from her to me **at all**. So inviting her in must be done with all caution, understand?"

Tia stands up, and extends her hand out so that her palm is perfectly parallel with Van's. She she very VERY carefully, gently squeezes Van's hand, and moves it up and down. it could be called a handshake. Possibly, "Hello." She says.

**Keep your friends close, your enemies closer?** asks the Ghost Knight, almost curiously. **Better to control, or at least know, where she goes and who she speaks with, I would imagine.** He pauses a moment.

**She contains no radio source, active or otherwise,** reports the Ghost after a few moments of silence. **You have at least that much assurance. We will keep a careful eye on her.**

"Precisely," replies the Yamaguchi Corp's head. "There are far too many unanswered questiosn for me to be comfortable." A nod to the information. "Good. That's some form of a comfort. All right. Now... to figure out where to keep her."

**We keep her here, until you make other arrangements. Certainly you must have some sort of discreet laboratory for your conventional researches; I suggest partitioning that. And... there is one thing I require from you, in return. I will keep the secret you carry, if you will keep one of my own.** The Ghost seems almost hesitant, almost human, even as his resonant pseudo-voice speaks.

Lydon eyes the Ghost Knight for a few moments skeptically. "All right. What is it?" With a wry grin, "Isn't my first born, is it?"

**I.... need help flying. I am capable of it, but there is a fear that I have, which restrains me. I need you - Tengu - to be ready to restrain me if I find myself out of control, and I would like some time to practice, here, when the suit is repaired and you can aid me.** The Ghost speaks diffidently, feeling himself burning with humiliation as this simple, stupid truth is admitted to a comparative stranger. How did I ever get myself into this..?

This takes Lydon a bit by surprise, but his emotions do not show for long. "Done. You're concerned about losing control. Doing something new takes a lot of practice, patience, and worry." He sounds like he understands. Or perhaps can feel the uncomfort, the hesitation.

**We understand each other.** This profoundly simple statement carries without all the tones of relief and satisfaction that would have welled out in Tom's own voice, and for a moment he is grateful of the emotional barrier that this artificial synthesis of sound provides. **In the meantime, we ought to investigate the men we downed.**

"Yes." He frowns, "I'll have Vanessa and Guy work on it. Van can get the police reports - hopefully - and Guy can talk to the police if he's wiley enough. We don't need you and DarkGlow slipping in and smacking them around in their holding cells. Too risky, too suspicious."

Outside, DarkGlow scratches idly at his right arm. _Really ought to find a bathroom or something. Wonder if Mr. Undead takes pee breaks..._ He shifts his attention. _If Tengu's that badly damaged, it might be a while before he's seen again. And wouldn't that be a shame...? And hardly_ my _fault._ Remembering something, he digs into his light backpack.

Thomas shrugs a little. **I assume that the police will have conducted their own interrogation. My intention was simply to intercept it.** He releases the fist he's made, and the gloved hand slumps to his side again. **However, we'll stay if you prefer. It's only Tengu's real identity at stake.**

Lydon nods, and puts his hands in his slacks. "I hope so. I do not think any of them saw, but Tia did." He gives that knowing look, as if to say that may be a bad thing indeed. "Eavesdropping on the interrogation is not a problem either. Oh. And hopefully an alternative method of communications can be found."

**Then we will return shortly,** says the Ghost Knight, again seeking out DarkGlow. **Going or staying?** he asks of this worthy. **We'll find out what we can without arousing suspicion.**

DarkGlow looks up, mouth again full with a bite of his second chicken salad sandwich. He swallows. "Uh... going." He looks at teh other half of his sandwich and asks, "Want this?"

**I have no use for food,** replies GK coldly. **Before we go, we ought to assure Tia's safety. Lydon is arranging something, and the police may require time to complete their interrogation.**

"Riiight... I mean, good." DarkGlow hurriedly stuffs the rest of the sandwich into his mouth and pockets the cellophane wrapper. He gestures the other to lead on.

Lydon walks into the room with Tia and Vanessa. Van who has been struggling to make conversation with the android. She looks up to Lydon, but the man's attention is on Tia. "Tia, do you... sleep? Or need any kind of equipment to recharge?"

Tia looks over to where Lydon emerges from, "I don't sleep as you might expect, but I do require a recharge period."

"Right. Does this require any sort of special machinery, or are you self recharging?" He casually leans against the table. "If it's the former, we'll have to see to building you something. If it's the latter, I have a protected place you can go. Lock you down, where no one can get to you, while you recharge. Then we can find somewhere better for you to stay."

Tia nods, "I can recharge myself, for now. But if I am to be... reconfigured, I require.. substantially more equipment then I have seen."

Lydon's brow raises. "'Reconfigured'?"

Tia nods, "My operational parameters can be altered to fit a given situation."

"Hm. You'll have to tell me more on this." A smile over to Vanessa. "Want to come with us?" Though, the look he offers her is half a plea, and half an order. "Um... sure," She replies.

Tia is standing, in approximatly the same spot she was to begin with, "Oh, should I follow?" She asks? This seems ot be the case, so she falls in stride with Lydon.

Ghost Knight and DarkGlow head to the police station. This is handled by the prescent nearest to the crimescene. As it turns out, interrogations had not been going long. As the two observe over two different scenes, it's pretty much the same: The individuals do not crack. They do not say who they are working for, where they got the weaponry they had, what they were doing. Both secret observers note the fear in their eyes, the almost zealotish way they defend themselves. Obviously, it is not the police or jail that scares them. After around an hour of no luck, it is suggested from one of them to the other that they return, and have Guy and Vanessa procure any results, because so far, none have come out. It seems pretty hopeless. Exiting the building, DarkGlow calls Lydon, who instructs them for the moment they are 'off the clock'. While he is in the research and development facility of Yamaguchi Corp, working with Tia.

Preparing himself for the long road ahead, Tom finds his way to an out-of-the-way park, divesting himself of armor and helmet and relaxing for as long as he dares. The burdens of school work, the demands of his relationship, and the tension of his 'night life' are permitted to drift away slowly but surely as he considers the grass, the trees, the water and the peaceful calm that pervades this quiet place. _Soon,_ he thinks to himself, _soon I'll be taking the next step.. It's for the best, right?_

Tia works with Lydon, seeming not to tire at all. She goes carefully through 'Tia Engeneering 101' as much as she can, with the gear not setup for active reconfiguration... She nods to Lydon, tersly, "I require .... sleep, I guess." And she wanders to a corner, out of the way, sits down, and stops responding to stimulios.

DarkGlow considers the outside of the warehouse with undue consideration. _Well, I guess I should make an effort. Wouldn't want my wrist slapped. But as soon as my belly growls, I'm heading home._ He blinks invisibly into an interior corner, and feels around carefully for the prescence of shadows. _And if I get caught, I was just looking for Tia, to give her a few combat tips, like polishing armour is **not** something you do in the middle of it._ Scratching at his wrist, he teleports again.
