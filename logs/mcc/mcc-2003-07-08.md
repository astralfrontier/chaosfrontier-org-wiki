# Millennium City Chronicles 2003-07-08

High Park. A comfortable, happy place, situated on the roof of the Millenium Mall. There are lots of stuff a top the building; an area for tanning and swimming, trees and paths for walking, a jogging track, all the comforts of a park, with the even more convenient set of stores beneath.

As of late, things have been getting curiouser and curiouser. _Huh. That makes two BoD's from Dew, killed. There's likely a connection..._ Guy is sitting casually on a bench, across the way from a circle of statues. Currently he's pondering one of them, while absently finishing off the remnants of an order of fries. _He should be on time, I hope._

A man in a floral shirt sits down beside Guy. He looks like a tourist; Khaki pants, a big fat diving watch, even the baseball hat for the the Chicago Bulls. A thick, grey beard makes him look like Santa Claus, only dirtier, like he shoved his head into a fireplace. He turns his head to Guy, chuckling. "Nice day." Then, looking out over the statues, "Blueberry." So his contact is a little... ecentric. This is supposedly the third time he's met the man, and the second time he's appeared as someone else.

"Indeed." Guy shrugs, taking the eccentricness in stride. "Nice getup. Y'know I've got a shirt like that back home."

"Really? Nice to know." Crossing his arms. "So, you wanted to know something."

"Yeah. I was curious. Seems like the Dew Chemical Corporation's rapidly losing it's board of directors. Two of 'em anyway. One had an argument with a train-and lost-as I'm sure you know. Just recently, another fell. They think. Witnesses from the subway station say they saw something. An angel, or a ghost... a cloud of fog around the guy that shoved him in the tracks and was speaking to him. Kept him there, while he screamed. Someone said they'd heard the words raven ant. Or the like... I'm wondering what you know?" Guy leans back then, and waits for the fellow to process this.

"Well," The dirty Santa replies, shifting on the park bench, "There was a man named Rafael 'Cold Fist' Caloosa. Notice how I said Was. He happened to be a mob enforcer. Happened to be found monday morning... You ever take a bug, when you were a kid and tear it apart? Well, that's what Caloosa looked like. A bug that had been torn apart and stepped on. The news hasn't found out; the mob likes to keep inner family deaths quiet. They're very mad. They have a suspect."

Guy nods, slowly. "A man... was..." He shudders at the mental image. "You're graphic, if nothing else, y'know that? Caloosa'd been taken apart... so uh, what does that have to do with this? Who's their suspect?"

A little shrug, as Guy's informant looks out over the statues. "The Ghost Knight."

Guy blinks. "The Ghost Knight? Alright. So why do they suspect him? And er... what's that got to do with the people at Dew?"

"Well, Caloosa was found in a locked room. No windows, no secret doors, no nothing. No body heard him scream. There are only a few known people who can slip in through walls. Ghost Knight's one of them. And he's been known to get a little ruthless when it comes to criminals. Only one they knew who had the power to do it, too." He sideglances to Guy. "Supposedly, Dew has had a few ah... deals with certain individuals. Supposedly they havn't since supposedly the directer who had the most ties had a carbomb go off under his seat last year."

Guy nods, "Ahhhh. So that explains why he's suspected. He might. Although, I dunno... he doesn't seem the type to pick someone apart like that. So Dew's had dealings with the family? Well that works... but it doesn't explain why the BoD would start dropping like flies..."

He shrugs. "I have no clue. But look at things. Alexander, Caloosa, and now this man who fell down his stairs. That's one every night since Sunday. I'll be willing to bet my shoes that there'll be another one tonight. Who knows."

"Somewhere out there. Someone's got a grudge against Dew, and their ah... business partners... odds are it isn't Ghost Knight either. Is there anything else ya can tell me?"

Movement catches Guy's eyes. There is a path about twenty yards from him, that opens into a path beyond trees. Beyond the path is a gazebo, and the gazebo isn't far from the statues. A woman with dark hair runs down the stairs, while a man crouches beside them. Another man jumps off the rail, stepping onto the crouching individual, then kicks him in the head. He runs after the woman. Other men, even the kicked one, stand up and race after them, fanning out. The kicking one runs out of sight, while the men closest to Guy's view pull guns from their jackets, and circle around behind the statues, where the woman is. They do not look happy.

He nods his head, looking outward. "The Mob wants the Ghost Knight. They're going after people who know him best: the media. He has a newshound that is always on his coat tails, so they think that she knows the most about his powers and where he is. She has an assistant, Christine Green." He points. "That's her."

"Well then it looks like that's my cue to go save the day... gimme a cal if you need anything..." And at that, Guy is off, moving towards the running girl, and her assailants.

Guy's contact slips a pair of sunglasses on, puts his hands in his pockets, and walks off. Guy hears the girl, Christine, call out "Tommie?" Guy can see the two men on his side hiding behind the statues, pistols bare. One of them spots Guy.

DarkGlow steps forward and emerges into the darkened recesses of an engineering lab. Or, at least it looks like a lab. Lights blink cheerily on obscure beige metal boxes, fans whirr gently, and unknown tools are neatly racked or shelved. It's the table, though, that really gives it away. In a forensics lab, the site of a partially dismembered body would not have been too unusual, but when the 'body' is actually a metal suit...? _Yep, engineering,_ decides DarkGlow. _Tengu, I presume? You've led me a merry chase, but now I've-- Ugh, it's late. Now I'm conversing with empty combat suits in my head. Emphasis on empty. Now, where are the laser cannons to fry unwary intruders, hmmm?_ A quick visual inspection reveals security cameras, possible motion sensors near the door, and a blank pad also by the door that a hand--and its associtated prints--would nicely fit, but no cannon. _Darn._

The shadows flicker in DG's view. The one he lurks inside feels cold. The sound like nails gliding across a chalk board enters his ears. The suit... did it just move?

Shadows pool near his feet. Thoughts jitter wildly as eyes scan for further movement. _Well, 'further' assumes I'm not just paranoid. Or insane. Or-- Dammit, I know I'm invisible, but why do I suddenly feel like I've left my pants at home and everyone's staring at me?_ His mind locks a distant shadow, and he waits to see if he should fight, flee or just call himself an idiot. Repeatedly.

The edges of DarkGlow's hearing are tickled. Like the sound of white noise in the background, it trickles. Whispers. Whispers that keep building, taunting him. Not the sound of mechanics, not the sound of an alarm, but something... something else. It starts to come into make sense, words plucked from the chittering. _You..._

_Great, it's phantom powered combat armour._ Lips stretch, slowly beoming a rictus. _Well, come on!_ he silently challenges. _Sound isn't gonna scare me off! Well, unless it's an alarm, but at least that implies more than just some stupid carnival trick!_

The rattling is growing greater in DarkGlow's ears. The surf beating against the rocks, the roar of the wind picking up inside of his head. Cold pangs claw across his skin. _You... killed... me..._ For an instant, DarkGlow flashes back to his dream.

DarkGlow struggles to recall the details of the nightmare, but they elude him. His thoughts are savage. _Maybe I did and maybe I didn't. And even if I did, it bloody well wasn't **my** idea. Take it up with my employers, whoever they were. And whoever you are, for that matter. Who the hell are you, anyway?_

The rustling of the wind through the trees still rattles in DG's head, but the clatter gets quieter, and quieter. The chill of the shadow grows less, until he feels that he is alone in the room again.

DarkGlow glances left and right and, seeing nothing unusual, lets the gathered shadows slip away again. _Hmm... priest or psychologist? Or are they necessarily any different these days? Come back an haunt me anytime, little phantom. I've dealt with darker demons than you..._

When nothings responds, he turns again to the task at hand. As much as he'd like to go poke the suit, DarkGlow restrains himself. _What would it accomplish? It's shiny metal with lots of wires and if I understood it, I'd be wearing one already. What I need is the name of the guy inside the suit._ Unfortunately, there are no name tags visible, and no 'if found, please return to...' signs. He sighs. _My stomach hasn't growled yet. Then again, apparently I'm being haunted. Screw it, I'm outta here._ He steps backwards and is suddenly no longer there.

Guy runs past the fellow, extending an arm as he does so. Said arm, twists, grabbing for the gunman's gun arm as the detective brings his other arm around the goon's side, in an attempt to throw the fellow to the ground. "Lookout! They've got guns!"

The gunman goes down, catching himself with his left hand, then swearing, shaking his left arm after hitting the ground. "Don't move, funny man," The other mobster says, pointing the gun at Guy. Red shirt steps into the circle. "Hello, Miss Green. We'd like to have a talk with you." Christine sounds a little startled. "Who are you?"

The guy Tom had knocked down flexes his fist, and starts to get to his feet. He points his gun at Tom, and jerks his head toward the circle of statues, toward Chris. He teacups the gun, watching Tom expectantly. Lips move to spell out 'I'll shoot'.

Thomas lunges forward, ducking under the discharge of the weapon, mentally cursing himself for allowing things to degenerate this far. The student sweeps his leg in a semicircle, and as his assailant is still in midair, Tom finishes the job by slamming his elbow hard into the man's gut. He crouches over the unconscious body, looking toward the center of the park's walk, trying hard to ascertain the situation as it stands now.

While Tom's assailant was holding him down, the fifth man had stepped behind Redshirt. As the shot is fired, Chris screams, "Tommie!"

Guy whips about, lashing out at the gun pointed at him. As his hand strikes the gunman's hand, knocking the gun out of the way, the detective replies, "How if you give me the gun instead, and just surrender now?"

Guy dashes towards Christine, leaving the mobsters where they stand for a bit. He looks about, positioning himself between Redshirt and the Girl. With a glance to Christine, "Come with me if you want to live..." _I've always wanted to say that..._ "I can get you out of here, but only if you wish to come along... anywhere's bound to be better than here... right?"

Chris looks from Guy to the others, then back, then shakes her head, stepping away. "Wait, no... Where's Tom. Tom?" She calls out, looking to the mobsters. "What do you want?" Her voice is a little hysterical. It's a little obvious she hasn't been in dangerous situations before.

Thomas comes out quickly but deliberately from behind the statuary, loping toward the collected crowd. "Chris, it's okay," he calls out reassuringly.

From the other side moves in the man Guy had knocked down, gun in hand, teacupped. "Okay, no body move. Any more this kung-fu bullshit and I hi-ya a bullet in you's ass."

Chris's eyes get real big. Redshirt, the obvious ringleader, waves his hand. "Hold on, hold on. I can explain this. Miss Green, all we want to know is about your business. You're a reporter, right? We just got a few questions. Everyone's nice, all right?"

Thomas stays still, keeping his eyes narrow. He's confident that he can survive this, but about Chris....

"Well last time I checked, nice people didn't point guns at people or chase obviously scared people through the park. Moreover," _Best not to insult his taste in clothing. At least not 'til he starts shooting you._ "Nice people don't offer to shoot those who move." Guy then says to Christine, "Say the word and you're safe... or at least not being shot at and such."

The man Guy had disarmed moves in behind Chris. He's very close, and obviously has his weapon. Then again, Chris doesn't know he's there. She looks at Guy just as frightfully as she does the other ones. "W...what about me being a reporter?" "We want to know about the Ghost Knight," Redshirt explains.

Guy whispers to Christine "Listen, lady, this isn't going to end in a friendly manner. Already you've got a creep sneaking up on you from behind... my advice to you is to want to get away, and fast, before somethin' bad happens."

"The Ghost Knight?" "Yeah, we-" The sound of gunshots are heard, the statues behind Redshirt chipping. Everyone turns. The man behind Chris pushes forward, gun extended, while the one across from Tom turns back in the direction of the Gazebo.

Thomas is already running forward, as though fully expecting this new development - prepared for it, in fact. He leaps up, spinning as he does so, and his foot connects with the man's neck. The gunman behind Chris is struck, and falls in a heap as Tom himself lands, immediately ready to make his next move.

Guy turns towards the fellow with the gun held in his fist. He shakes his head, "Well... I suppose we'll just have to do this the easy way..." He twists to one side of the gun barrel as he brings his fist just under the shoulder of the goon. He ducks under the arm, grabbing his gun as he does so and twisting it from the fellow's grasp.

Thomas is still in motion, and he crouches low, again snapping his leg out in a wide arc and catching the two men who remain. Each goes crashing down to the park walkway.

Guy runs over to aide Tom in dealing with these mafia ruffians. He leans down and deftly grabs both of their guns, trenchcoat swirling about as he does this. "Hey... remember what I said about nice people and guns... yeah... I lied."

Chris is in the back, holding the gun of the thug Tom kicked in the neck. She looks like she doesn't like touching it, but what else can she do? She's backed herself up against a statue, watching everyone with eyes just a little wild and scared. "Tom?" She hazards. The only man still standing raises his hands. He knows when he's been had.

Thomas holds up both hands, then begins walking toward Chris slowly, smiling. "Hey, it's okay, hon... relax now, everything's okay... you're fine, I'm fine.." He's still worried sick, but at least everything turned out for the best, as far as he can tell. But what did Guy mean by showing up here, now?

"Alright... you guys had best get to safety. Or wait around here and call the police... either way... your choice." Guy looks towrds the mobsters, then back at Christine, then he shrugs. "Perfect timing..." _There's no **way** that the guy knew they would be here... was there? What if he did?_

Redshirt and his buddy are in a pushup position, but they aren't going anywhere. The guy Tom kicked in the throat seems to have learned how to breath properly again. Chris crains her neck. "I think the mall cops are coming." "Aw great. Ran in by a frickin' _Rent-A-Cop_." The still standing man whines.

Smiling a little, Tom nods. Apparently things are under control. With this realization, of course, new emotions burst to the surface and he turns to face Guy, scowling. "What the hell are YOU doing here?" he demands imperiously, seemingly out of the blue.

Guy blinks a few times. _Who **is** this guy?_ "Well I'm saving your butts, it looks like... but uh... do I know you?"

Chris just watches Tom and Guy uncertainly.

Thomas blinks for a moment, as he thinks this over. He shakes his head. "You were at the police station, when the New Purple Gang attacked," he says at last. "I saw footage. I remember you..." He shrugs. "So. Who are these guys?"

Guy nods, "Ah..." _Huh. I don't remember any cameras. In fact... I was in disguise for that. Unless it wasn't as clever as I thought... but what can you do when you don't have immediate access to yellow spandex?_ "But that can wait until later..." he says aloud. "I'll be willing to make a wager as to who they are... but uh, after the rent-a-cops come by."

"Well good for them," says Tom, curtly, turning. He beckons to Chris, again all smiles. "Come on, let's sit down somewhere for a few.."

Chris nods, and steps over the man on the ground, moving carefully out of the way, gun held like she doesn't want anyone to tempt her. She steps out of the ring, and leans heavily on Tom. Pointing, "There's a bench over there." "Everybody... Freeze..." Not that intimidating when it's out of breath, but the fourty-something security guard hauled ass to get over here. A second, a third are moving in behind him, but they look in better shape then him.

The mobsters are thusly cuffed, and the police arrive sooner then they should have. A man in blue commented that they had recieved an annonymous tip that there were men with guns on the roof. Chris, Tom and Guy give their statements to the police. Seeing Guy's license and running a check on the mobsters' IDs proved they were criminals for something. The police took their word for it. They were released.

After the whole hubub, Christine blinks. "Oh shit. I better call Arlene."
