After the incident, Guy slips away, looking over the area. He can't exactly find much. It seems the men must have just walked into the scene, and likely their cars are somewhere in the immense parking lot of the mall. Nothing he can gain by just looking around the place. And Guy knows that really, the Mob is not a group he can get information from freely; discovering things further may take time, effort... or knowing the right people who can do it for him.

_Ah. Dinner with the mob. Sounds like fun... I only hope that I don't end up with a horse head in my bed._ Guy searches about the parking lot a bit more, and shrugs. "Well Guy..." he murmurs, "You're havin' fun now." He dials up DG and GK, waiting patiently to get ahold of someone.

DarkGlow sourly pulls out his ringing cell phone. It's sound is barely louder than his belly's. "I'm sorry, the superhero known as DarkGlow cannot come to teh phone as he is trying to decide what to order for dinner. If this is a save the world type emergency, please call 911. Otherwise, don't leave a message. Beep."

"Ah." Guy's voice takes on that invariably unnatural and nervous, almost unsure tone that most people's voices do when confronted by answering machines. "Well, I suppose I'd probably not leave a message, but uh, er, there's this thing here in the park, with these guys who are part of the family, y'know, and uh, they were chasin' someone with info. Cristine, or somesuch."

DarkGlow says, "Who? Uh... oops."

"Oh. Hey you're there." Guy's voice becomes a good deal more natural and smooth sounding. For Guy, anyway. "So yeah... I was wondering if you knew anything about her? Or about someone called Revenant or somesuch? A ghost or mist or something that's been knocking off board of directors?"

DarkGlow coughs. "Uh, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, mind you--it means you guys are off having adventures without me, which I heartily approve of. Anyway, carry on, keep up the good work and so on and so forth. Say, know any good takeout places in town?"

"Ah true. Although it's really just been me following up a lead, though I'd like to ask for everyone's help ya know. I'll tell ya what, I'll fill you in over some decent food? I happen to know a takeout place near uh... my office... such as it is." Guy chuckles a little sheepishly.

DarkGlow tries to picture actually going out to dinner with the detective and fails miserably--_Which is how the dinner would probably end up, anyway..._ "Uh... actually, I'm kinda indisposed. How about you give me the quick 'n dirty version over the phone? "

"Right. Well don't say I haven't done anything for you. Quick 'n' dirty. Some kinda mist or ghost or superpowered thing is goin' around bumping off boards of directors for Dew Chemical Corporations, and I think, perhaps, the Mob as well. But they think GK killed their guy."

Guy says, "And this is decidedly not good."

DarkGlow nods to himself. "Yeah, knocking off skullface would probably be a bit nasty, wouldn't it? But GhostKnight? Are we sure he's gone rogue? I mean, I know he's a bit wrapped up in the fantasy, but a few more years under his belt'd probably knock the crap out of his head..."

"In all honesty, I don't think he did it. It sounds like the thing that this other supernaturalish thing's been using."

Guy says, "Er, at least in my opinion."

DarkGlow says, "Ah. Don't suppose you've actually talked with him about this, then?"

Guy says, "Not yet, know."

"He isn't picking up his cell?" DarkGlow queries.

Guy says, "Uh, no, not yet. That is to say I hadn't tried him. I was wondering if you thought he might have done it or knew the best way to bring it up in conversation?"

DarkGlow considers. "Well, if you think he did it, with a team of SWAT snipers aiming at his head and maybe a Champion or three backing them up while you call from the next city over. If not, open up with 'I think someone's framing you...' and see where it goes. Have you established any sort of connection between Dew Chemical and the Mob? Or have any idea who's possibly next? I could keep tabs on a likely target, and stop any future attempts..." _Now there's a switch..._

"Oh yeah. Uhm, about that. I dunno. Really. Or at least not enough to wanna say anything over the phone. Anyway I'm gonna go call GK, talk to ya later."

With a click, Guy hangs up the phone, and then dials the Ghost Knight's cell phone, blissfully unaware of the hero's doomed phone.

DarkGlow frowns at his dead cell. "Hey, no problem. Happy to help. Anytime really." Clicking the device off, he resolutely begins to hunt down a copy of the Yellow Pages.

Well seeing as how the erstwhile detective has a few things left to do, he plods about town, carefully. He checks his list of contacts, and heads for the police. _I mean... it's not like they make this sort of thing their business, or anything_ thinks Guy, with a smirk. He steps into a familiar looking precinct, to say hello to his fellow detectives...

The desk clerk waves to Guy, who had arrived there earlier in the day. "Hello Mr Neville."

There's that winning smile. Guy nods "Hello again. How're you? I don't suppose Riggs and Lowery have reported back in yet? I was hopin' to get in touch with them about a case, as it happens."

Some strokes on a computer give him a slight nod. "Yup. They're here."

"Thanks." Guy heads for the office then, and knocks on the door. He wanders in after a bit, "Hey guys... I might have an interesting lead for ya..."

Riggs is looking over a file, while Lowery is on the phone. Both look up at Guy as he enters the room. "Go on," Riggs calls.

"Seems like the Mob might be in on this thing. I had a run in with a few of their goons in the park, and they seemed adamant about questioning someone. Apparently one of their guys was offed as well." Guy nods, "From what I was able to find out, anyway."

This seems to have their attention. Riggs has a notebook out almost immediately. "Names?"

"I'm not certain yet of the big names..." But Guy rattles off the names that were given to the park cops when they came to arrest the goons.

Guy says, "Anyway, what've you guys found out?"

The police inform Guy that not much has passed. Cunningham's wife didn't hear anything, and went to check when her husband went to inspect a noise. She went to check, and found him. The body is at the moment at the morgue, though is not due for inspection for a few hours; a lot of work is being processed through the Medical Examiner's plate today. The Dew Chemicals board know nothing, but are definetly startled and nervous. Nothing else is really taken from the situation, and Guy isn't given that many clues; it seems the cops are flailing like he is.

At night, the red brick of the County Medical Examiner's building is wrapped in inky shadows. The halls of the basement, the city morgue, are full of gloom and stifled quietness, sound echoing like a forgotten cave. DG sheds darkness like streams of water, while the Ghost Knight slips in through the ceiling, drifting to the floor, a spectre haunting the dead halls. The two have found a remote room, and by the GK's senses, there are people milling around the basement. Three, to be exact.

Thomas extends his perceptions through walls and doors and other barriers, and via his power the air in this secluded chamber vibrates softly to echo what is heard beyond.

Voices filter into the Ghost Knight's hearing. "... and it looks like the drugs did a number on this guy," Comments a young voice. "Even if the bullets destroyed some organs, he was still moving... I think his heart stopped." "Good," A scratchy, feminine voice replies. The other person is somewhere else, and from what the ghost knight can tell, he's not talking.

GK turns to his associate, conferring in low tones as the voices continue to resonate out of empty air. **I can sense Cunningham's corpse from here, but I must know which one. Please find out where he is being kept, and direct me?**

DarkGlow looks nonplussed at the voices emerging from nowhere--or would if his face were visible. _Maybe I'm not haunted. Maybe a super's got too much time on their hands..._

DarkGlow glances over his shoulder, wondering if he was actually being addressed, then back to GhostKnight. With a shrug, he looks around for a computer terminal or, failing that, a clipboard with the cold storage assignments.

The room itself is actually a storage closet. Cleaning equipment, extra medical items, so on are kept here. Of course, with GK's perception, he can designate the layout, where most things are. The bodies are west of them, while a computer happens to be just in the next room. Seeping through the walls and shadows earn them access to the computer. However, access to the files is a touch more difficult; a password is required.

With a shrug, DarkGlow mutters, "Well, if I don't want to scare the info out of some doctor, I can just start opening drawers and peeking at toe-tags..."

Cloaked in shadow, DarkGlow starts methodically pulling open storage drawers in the first empty room of the morgue. _Hmm... they're a lot neater than when I usually get done with 'em..._

Meanwhile, the Ghost Knight opens the door with his silence-enriched powers, and then shuts down the computer. He cracks the door open in the room across the hall, allowing the person inside to hear as the computer begins to boot back up. Hiding appropriately in the wall, the janitor walks in, and huffs. He steps back out into the hall, where the sound of a gourney is being rolled. "Computer's acting up," He calls. "Allright. Tell Dr Keifer, I got to put this guy on cold storage." The janitor walks away, as the door to where DG is opens, the body rolled in casually.

DarkGlow glances up from reading a toe-tag at the intrusion, and quickly retreats out of the way. The drawer is left open about a hand-span or two, but that can't be helped at the moment.

A drawer is openned, the young doctor shoving the corpse's table inside and slamming it closed. He then walks out, leaving DG behind. GK watches as an older, square blonde woman walks in. She frowns, and crosses over to the computer, before dropping beside of it to start poking and checking things. And first she inserts the needed password. 'B0nes'. A few things are inspected on the computer, before she shakes her head, and stands. She takes a cigarette out of her labcoat, and walks out of the room with a closing of the door.

Perceptions checked, it seems she's outside in the hallway, likely smoking. The Ghost Knight sits down, enters the code, and finds William Cunningham. In locker E-1. As he stands up, the door opens, and the raspy voice of someone who's smoked too long calls out, "You could've just asked, you know."

Waiting for the man to finish, DarkGlow reflects upon the procession of bodies he's just examined. _Death from heart attacks, stabbings, what must have been a pretty mangled car accident... Doesn't take a hell of a lot to wind up in here does it?_ His mind casts back over the last few years, and he nods to himself. _Not much at all._ His eyes run over the rows of drawers, but he refuses to do the mental math to figure out how many there are. _Many,_ he thinks, but suddenly doesn't want to know if there're enough... Thoughts shy away, but he doggedly finishes the idea: Enough to hold his targets. He almost feels the darkness of the shadows seeping into his brain, and there's little he can do to dispel the feeling. _Let's just get out of here ASAP, okay?_

Thomas rises from the system, turning to inspect the doctor who arrived. _Bus-ted...._ He stands still, summoning what's left of his dignity before speaking in that dead, dry bass. **I am here to inspect a body. Cunningham.**

She nods, and opens the door. "All right." Taking a drag of her cigarette, "Don't feel too bad about me catching you," She comments, as if reading his thoughts. "You don't work here as long as I do, and get late night visits without growing a sense of intuition. And good hearing." She gives a jerk of her head, and walks down the hall, leading him to the appropriate room. Lights on, the drawer pulled out, she exposes the cold body, the head twisted at an odd angle, bruises lining the corpse.

DarkGlow blinks at the doctor's and GhostKnight's arrival. He steps away from the wall, dropping his invisibility. Casually approaching them, he says dryly, "Gee, asking a doctor? Why didn't I think of that?"

Thomas doesn't respond, instead concentrating for moments on his psychic sense, and summoning all that he's learned of medicine and anatomy to serve him. He probes without reservation, seeking answers from this man's mortal remains by examining down to the very foundations of the universe.

Keifer just looks up at DarkGlow a second, smirking. Looking to GK, "I know you, but who's he?" The body has multiple bruises, and from some gentle investigation, broken bones, definetly a broken neck, a dented skull. The doctor waits silently beside, as if waiting for a question.

"Excuse my colleague, Doctor," DarkGlow says, his tone sardonic. "I'm afraid he's not the most... conversant of sorts. I hope he didn't scare you? Allow me to introduce myself: DarkGlow. But newly arrived in this city--and still trying to stay out of the papers."

**He's my teammate,** adds GK after a few moments. He names breaks and bruises as he finds them, precisely pronouncing the medical terminology, sometimes indicating with a gloved finger. **I had hoped for more... fiber traces, stray hairs with foreign DNA. Useful information.**

"Have the forensics not already been gathered?" DarkGlow asks.

Keifer gives a nod. "New faces filtering in here. Lovely." The sarcasm isn't thick enough to be biting. "Yes," Keifer replies, before her attention shifts to Ghost Knight. "He's allready had his autopsy. The only thing that was found on him was his wife's hair, and she was sleeping next to him. It would seem as though he fell down some stairs." This said while she merely stares at GK, an expectant look on her face.

Thomas shakes his head at last. **A dead end, so to speak,** he remarks coldly. **But perhaps....**

"Mmhm." GK notices the harshness of the wounds, that seem too damaging to be from the mere momentum. She lifts one of the arms, showing some irritation along the skin. "The skin has been pressed, along the body. There's no prints, but it's like when you squeeze clay, you leave a small impression. Take a look at the wounds. Just falling wouldn't have caused this. The first wound was on his back, along the shoulders. He would have had to do a backflip to hit there first." After a moment, "I believe he was picked up, telekineticly, and thrown down them for an unhappy landing." She clucks her tongue, and sideglances to GK.

DarkGlow chuckles. "I do believe she suspects you, 'teammate'..."

Thomas responds by raising two hands. One, aimed at the doctor. The other, at a chair. The chair lifts, quite easily, and hovers in the air. The doctor, of course, remains motionless. **The aura of life guards against my power,** he explains after a moment.

Keifer smiles ruefully. "Tell that to the police. Think I'd be helping you if I thought you played ragdoll with him? Also, his spine was shattered, skull fractured. Whoever threw him packed enough strenght to leave splinters in the skin. Whoever did this has immense strenght, and tossed it around carelessly. Almost good enough to hide it, but they got reckless."

Thomas thinks for long moments, then turns his attention to DarkGlow. **It is time to act more openly,** he says after a moment. **Let's return.** To the doctor he bows, briefly, then begins to disappear into the floor.

She waves, and then calls as he has nearly disappeared. "Next time, say hello before you snoop. I don't like thieves, even the ones that steal information."

DarkGlow watches GhostKnight disappear, then also bids the doctor farewell. "Thank you for your help. I do hope we don't meet again, but I don't think that's too likely." He starts backing toward a darkened corner. "Don't mind him too much--or me, for that matter..." He disappears.

Back at stately... Yamaguchi.... run-down warehouse, the Ghost explains with his usual brevity the information that was gleaned from the morgue. **A telekinetic is the likeliest culprit,** he concludes. **Whatever the nature of the entity responsible, there must be a motive. We will need to identify it, quickly.**

"I believe I can help with that. Vengeance. Or something along those lines. I believe this may have something to do with the mob. Rafael Caloosa, if I'm not mistaken, was found torn to shreds, they think you did it... and he was one of the ones who wasn't happy about the deals Dew and the Family were making." says Guy.

"If there's any pattern to the killings, then it might also be possibly to identify a few people as possible next victims--and then keep an eye on them," DarkGlow adds.

Guy says, "Yeah, here's yer pattern. Dew Chemical Corporation B o D members."

DarkGlow says, "But is that enough to point to whoever's next? Or are there so few left that we can watch them all?"

**It's not likely that the entire board supported the decision. I for one have no objection to Mafia-connected board members being erased. However, I worry that the killer may not be so discriminating,** says GK. **It would be useful to find out who is connected, and what the nature of the deal was?**

"It would be. I've asked a few people I know to work on it, but then that's about all I can think to do for now. Dealing with the Mob's... tricky... to say the least."

Guy says, "Unless you like having horse heads as comforters."

**Then I will speak with them,** says the Ghost, sounding cold as death.

"Well," Vanessa says, looking over some of the notes she'd made on the information, "If the three murderse are a pattern, then maybe another mob guy is going to die tonight? Because he got A Dew guy Sunday, then a mob guy monday, then a Dew guy last night, and... well, I guess we'll have to wait and see if there's a body, and who tonight?"

Thomas shakes his head. **Guy, tell me what you can about making contact with the Family Dew dealt with. I will see about this matter. Perhaps I will even be there when the killer arrives.**

"I'm not sure how to contact them. I made a rather rough contact with 'em in the park earlier. But uh, like I said, this Cristine Green girl is supposed to know more about it. Or rather she's the assistant to another reporter who does." says Guy.

Thomas frowns inwardly. Chris wouldn't know anyone in the Mob. But maybe it'd be a smart idea to stick close to her... **I'll handle it then,** he says curtly.

Guy nods, "Alright. Oh you ought to be careful, this reporter she's the assitant to, also is supposed to know stuff about you. She might be in danger too y'know But I'm sure you could kick their butts or something."

DarkGlow shrugs, then says offhandedly, "Consdiering that the papers think you're a criminal, terrorizing them would probably not be a good thing for future relations. Then again, I think no press is good press, so take it as you will."

**I wish for no future relations with the Mob, and I care little for what the papers think of me,** answers GK somewhat testily. **As for Arlene Raymond, she may be in danger, and she merits my protection, even if she is a pox of a woman. I will do what must be done, and I will do it in my own way.**

DarkGlow shrugs again. "Better you than me. If you want anyone else watched, though..."

"Alright," says Guy, upon remembering something else. "Oh hey there was another guy there who helped me beat up those goons. I think it might've been a friend of hers. You might wanna look into his safety as well."

DarkGlow says, "This guy got a name?"

Guy says, "Tommy or Thomas or Tom or something along those lines. I dunno. It's what the girl was shouting at the time."

**If he took on Mob enforcers, he hardly needs my protection,** comments GK dryly, even as he's grinning on the inside. That guy, huh? Sure, I know something about him.. **Any of you are welcome to come with me, if you have no other projects to undertake. I am capable, but not omnipotent.**

Tia is off to the side, rather quiet. She turns her head as the others talk in turn, but has little to add herself.

DarkGlow says, "I've a couple things to take care of, but after that I'll lend a pair of eyes. I'd rather not confront a reporter, though." _Or the Mob, for that matter..._

Tia ponders, but really can't do anything covert, so she fails to respond.

"Well lemme know what more I can do to help..." Guy blinks at Tia, "And uh... I'm Guy, by the way." He ponders GK, "New team member?"

Thomas nods.

Tia nods to Guy. "Tia." She states, tersely.

"She's an android we rescued," DarkGlow supplies. "Bit of a mystery actually, even to herself." Kicking himself--_An android isn't a piece of furniture!_\--he says, "Sorry, you've just been rather quiet. If you've anything to say, feel free. Or not," he hastens to add. "Quiet is okay--" He breaks off before he sounds even more like an idiot. "Anyway..."

Tia turns her head to Dark Glow, and stares at him as he speaks. "Thanks..." She adds.

Guy chuckles a bit, and then nods, "Mystery's are my specialty, y'know. Sort of." The detective looks about, "Well we'll have to go see who else we can interview. A mob guy, I think is s'posed to be going down tonight? We'll have to... ugh... keep an eye out."

Thomas nods, thinking. **Alright. I will establish whatever connections to the Family I can. I want you three to go find this Miss Green, or the young man she was with. Find out what you can. I will meet you here in three hours. I believe we have some time.**

Vanessa hrms. "Well, if another Dew guy may die tomorrow, then we may want to go ahead and start working on figuring out who, and maybe try and ambush the guy then?"

Thomas nods. **Vanessa, please work on that. I would like to at least be nearby when tonight's event takes place. The Mob will not be standing idly by, and their senior members will likely not be separating from each other for long. We may learn something useful tonight.**

DarkGlow says, "That's what I was thinking. Access to a corporate-type is proabably a lot easier than to some Mob thug."

Lydon clears his throat. "I've been working on something while you all have been gone; I'll have some radios worked up by tomorrow for you to use. They will work on a private channel, and high enough frequency to work over most of the city."

Nodding to Lydon, GK continues. **This is important. The Mafia wanted me removed already. They really dislike me now,** says the Ghost. **However, they are useful enough sources of information, so I want at least some of them alive, for now. Besides, the earlier we can learn what we can, the more valuable that knowledge will be when we are able to confront the entity.**

"Heh." Guy waits, patiently while Lydon and GK talk it out. "What if we took a look at the hangouts of the Family that this ghost is after? If we can do it invisibly I mean.""

Guy says, "You know, a good ol' fashioned stakeout..."
