DarkGlow sits back on his haunches and carefully examines the almost non-existant edge of his Shade's blade. How thick was it, really? He'd read about things, like mono-molecular blades, that were an atom wide at the edge and so capable of slicing through anything because it could fit between the bonds of any material and break them apart. But his blade... it was made out of shadow, not atoms. How thick, then, could it really be? It slices well enough already, of course, but...

His eyes refocus beyond the blade, and the dying form of Jimmy the something sharpens in his gaze. He'd never gotten close enough to the thing that had done for Jimmy, but he wondered exactly how well his blade would have worked against it anyhow--it hardly seemed to be made of atoms, and his shadow tentacles had pathetically little effect.

DarkGlow sighs and focuses not just his eyes but his attention on the still form before him. "Not dead... yet," he whispers again. He glances over a shoulder to where one of Jimmy's 'colleagues' still writhed in the confines of an entangling shadow. Going up against common people is one thing--they just fall over dead, usually--but mists and robots and battlesuits...

He sighs again, concentrating fully on Jimmy. _So, the assassin is supposed to nuture the lowlife scum back to health, eh, GhostKnight? I'm thinking I'd rather just puncture him a time or two more and have done..._ Nevertheless, he dismisses his blade. _Shame I left my first aid kit in my last life... What the hell do I do? Somehow I don't think 'apply pressure until the bleeding stops' is quite relevant to a guy with a splintered skull..._

DarkGlow regards various limbs bent sharply where joints aren't supposed to exist. _And splint are supposed to go on those, but I'm thinking that you're rather unlikely to be trying to do much more than moan for the next few months, so immobilization probably isn't an issue._ His eyes narrow. _What else...? Shock? Yeah, I suppose. Wrap him in a blanket or something._ He fingers his cloak speculatively. _Uh, no. Does the one Tia knifed have a jacket?_

He doesn't even bother muttering something witty like "Don't move." when he gets up to check. Other than insignificant tears (to the jacket; they're rather more significant to the torn and cooling flesh underneath), the body's coat looks to be servicable. He strips it off. Feeling slightly ridiculous, he carefully tucks the jacket around Jimmy and, in a moment of inspiration, tucks assorted bits of junk under his legs to prop them up. He almost winces when he feels the leg bones grind together when he moves them. Standing and examining his meager handiwork, he tells Jimmy, "Live or die, I don't care. But that's as much nursing as you're getting out of me."

The body is disposed of, or atleast, well hidden. It helps when those tentacles of umbra can lift quite a few hundred pounds. Boxes of car parts are casually lifted up, then dropped carelessly onto the corpse. Out of sight, out of mind. The police come. Gunshots, the tags on the car outside, hell, maybe an 'annonymous tip' warned them. But, among other things, an ambulance is called, and comes to collect Jimmy. He's carefully eased up onto a gurney. One of uniforms took the time to rifle through his pocket to find out who he is. "Jimmy Dugan? Shit. Someone needs to contact the Sarge."

With the ambulance crew inside tending Jimmy, DarkGlow slips out of shadow and swiftly scales the rear of the ambulance. _Riding on an ambulance's roof. Wonder if I can get arrested for that?_ He hugs the roof and hangs on, hoping general indifference will slow the driver's speed when he pulls out. _And if I slip, hope there's enough shadow to anchor me--or blink to the nearest alley._

The ambulance heads to MC's Mercy Hospital. immediately on arriving to the ER's unloading dock, they rush Jimmy in. DG follows behind, unseen, careful. Due to the technological advances in the 'MC Mercy', the procedure to check his vitals is quite fast. And while they still run tests, a few new medical equipment informs that Jimmy's having low brainwave activity. He doesn't look like he'll be waking up for a while, at least. A 'vital monitor', something like a high tech bracer gets attached to his arm, and the man is stuffed into a large room, and while cloth curtains are all around, it still seems impressively large and private. The place is manned by two different nurse stations.

DarkGlow stares glumly from the shadows behind an open janitor's closet. Strange, almost freakish people walk by, their shadows burned away by the omnipresent flourescent lighting. _Damn hospitals. Too bright for their--well, my--own good. And the janitor's gonna return sometime. Just hope Mr. Revenant doesn't follow his lead._ When the hallway is relatively clear, he steps around the door and into the closet, pulling the door shut behind him. Gloves and cloak vanish into his pack, and sunglasses and baseball cap appear. He pulls the elastic from his hair and lets the ponytail loose across his back. Hunching his shoulders and shuffling a little, he open the door again and steps outside. Glad of the glasses under the relentless light, he looks around for the nearest chair.

He finds one. And waits. And doesn't have to wait long. About twenty minutes after excaping the closet, three men that scream 'Cop' walk around the corner, approaching. They give DG a look, but keep on going, passing him and head into Jimmy's little 'area'.

Scowling, DarkGlow wonders if there's enough shadow pooling around the curtains to maintain invisibility. _This could be fun,_ he thinks as he quietly shambles into the nearest partition to Jimmy. _And I haven't practiced my whiney voice in a while, either..._ After a brief struggle with his chosen medium, he glances down at himself and suppress a sigh. _Well, if they don't look too close--so shut up and don't move._ He cocks on ear and listens to what he can.

"...this is him." "He looks pretty banged up." "Yeah. They were tight lipped for a little while about Caloosa, too. Good thing we got to this one fast." "All right. Says here," The sound of a chart moving, "His skull's beaten up pretty bad. I don't think we'll be getting any questions out of him anytime soon. You know what that means." "I'll call the Champions."

DarkGlow mentally gulps. _Champions. Uh... I think that's my cue to leave._ Nevertheless he waits a minute more. _They can't get here_ that _fast, right?_ Swallowing any thought of 'famous last words', he remains still.

The curtain ruffles, one of the cops walking away. "Okay, so Jimmy's there, he gets himself smacked around. We found shell casings and blood at the scene." "Tire tracks, too." "There's more to this." A stray glance from DarkGlow out from his hiding space earns him the sight of someone watching Jimmy's spot. He's in a chair, in front of another patient's curtain, but he's trying to hide the fact he's watching.

DarkGlow purses his lips. _And that's why we like invisibility, don't we? Piss-poor as these shadows are, anyway. But since Jimmy's going nowhere, I think I'll start following_ you _around instead, all right, cupcake?_ Vaguely he wonders which of he or the other has more to fear from the Champions, while he keeps his eyes on the fellow and his ears on the cops.

For the moment, the guy doesn't look like he's going anywhere either. "It's a shame we don't have any sealable proof this guy's a cutthroat." "We don't. We know it, but they have good lawyers." "Yeah." There's enough anger there to suggest years of bitter displeasure witht he system. "But from the looks of him, he won't be doing anything for a long while."

DarkGlow briefly considers turning state's evidence, but quickly feels better. _Thank God I'm in a hospitel, eh? Cures my ills even without a doctor around._ He tries to imagine GhostKnight taking the stand, but figures the judge might have a problem with a witness who insists on entering the courtroom via the floor. His lips twitch into a smirk.

The third comes back. "Okay, I put the call in. They're trying to contact him. No telling how long it'll take." 'Great. So what do we do?" "Well, you two stay here." "Why us?" "Because You know more about this case then I do, you don't have other work to do, and he doesn't give You the willies." "Willies. Great logic there." "Shut up."

Fourty five minutes of waiting bares fruit. The police had situated themselves, chattering about office politics, hockey, and those little snack cakes in the vending machine, the strawberry ones with the little thingies on top. And then he arrives. DarkGlow is in for the front row seat. He sees a man walking towards them, wearing a navy suit. And... that's all he can really see. It's not that the individual is covered up, or even that he's veiled by something Else, but his features simply don't register to DarkGlow, as if the guy was a walking portrait so old, that the distinct facial features had faded away. "Doctor?" "Yes," replies a voice with the hint of a french accent. "You know I do not like doing this sort of thing." "We know. But it is crucial that we get information right now." "Of course."

DarkGlow gets the feeling that the doctor-with-no-face isn't a registered medical practitioner at this hospital. _So what's he gonna do, comune with his spirit? Make him into a talking zombie? Read his mind-- Uh... not good._ DarkGlow suddenly tries to make his mind as inconspicuous as his body. _A nice easy meditation. There's no candles, and no scented smoke, but right now I really don't-- Quiet already!_ He takes shallow breaths, concentrating on them entering and leaving his body, and trying not to focus on sound or the guy in the hall.

'Doctor Annonymous' moves to Jimmy. "Pain," Is the first thing he says. The words are disjointed, like he were searching for each one. "A ghost. Vengence." They're coming with a little more confidence now. "A man at gunpoint, with Mr Dugan and other men. Then pain." Atleast a minute of silence. "I have a name. Neville."

It is cool inside DarkGlow's nostrils as he inhales, warm as he exhales. His eyes are open and he sees everything and nothing. _Neville? No one. Shhh..._

One of the cops had been sketching everything down. "Tell us more about the ghost." "Patience," The Doctor replies, and continues. "Lots of mist. Deep, black pits for eyes. Translucent, insolible. No distinct features, disembodied."

_Hatred. Don't forget-- Shh..._

"Anything else?" Silence. "He's in a coma. The damage is not life threatening, but he will not come out of this tonight." "Can you give us anything more?" "I'm sorry, officers, but I cannot go further. You and I both know the laws restricting pulling incriminating evidence from a person's mind, especially when not willingly given." "You're by the book, aren't you?" "By it? I bleed it." "Okay. Thanks for coming down."

_'Laws restricting'? Later..._ DarkGlow waited for the Doctor to leave without thinking about the Doctor leaving.

"One more thing, Officers." "Yes?" They turn, regarding the man. His body turns towards DarkGlow's direction, before he starts towards the opening. "It would be advised to watch this man. There is no telling what harm may befall him, and who is all ready concerned with his presence here." "We know that, Doctor." "So do they." He walks away. "What the fuck was that about?" One offers to the other.

DarkGlow struggles to not be surprised. One doesn't bolt when one _may_ have been caught. _Harm? Me? Never. Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb. Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow. White as the driven snow I am. White as these lights burning down on me. White._ His hands rise and his eyes drops, and the skin before him is almost translucent under the harsh white glow from above. Harsh white, like him.

"Yeah, I can see why he gives Murphy the willies." "Don't you mean, Not see?" A snicker. "Okay. Let's get a uniform in here to watch the guy."
