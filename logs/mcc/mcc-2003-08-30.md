# Millennium City Chronicles 2003-08-30

The day after the whole Revenant business, Guy has returned to the office. He actually gets a call about a missing person. An actual job. Unfortunately, though, the call came in during lunch, and there's no time to call the person back, before a knock comes to Guy's door.

"Yeah? Come in. Door's open." Guy is sitting in his usual position at his desk, feet propped up where papers might go, facing the monitor of his computer while preparing to eat half of what might once have been a PB&J.

The door swings open, Lowery and Riggs walk in. "Hey there, Mr Neville," Lowery calls, hands in his pockets. "Mm, peanut butter."

"Yeah. Well that's what the jar says anyway. I'm having trouble believing it... but it tastes good just the same." Guy gestures haphazardly with the sandwich towards a chair, "Have a seat," and shifts his view to focus on Lowery. "What can I do for ya today?"

Riggs speaks up. "Well, we were on the Dew case, as you recall." Sitting down, "And we incorporated some interesting findings into our investigation, namely Rafael Caloosa and Jimmy Dugan." He watches Guy then, with cool, unreadable cop eyes.

"Yeah? What about 'em? I've some interesting findings of my own about those guys. WHat with the whole Revenant thing. But uh... I'm guessin' you guys are here for more than idle chit-chat what with the cop-face and all. So let's have it out..." Guy thinks better of taking a bite out of his sandwich, sets it down, and sits up.

A nod. Lowery just contents with leaning against the wall. "Well, Jimmy Dugan's in a coma in the hospital. However, we got a name off of him, from an uh... outside source." He looks to Riggs, who gives nothing away. "Anyways, we got your name out of him."

"I'd be surprised if you didn't. Ask the guys who were with Ms. Greene at the house. We got a call from the Family, as it were, they said if I wanted everyone to live, I'd go outside and catch a ride with Jimbo the Twelve Gauge or somesuch rot. So I did. Luckily for me, Ghost Knight and some weird freak showed up about the same time Revenant did. Revenant-I think-started beating Jim-boy with his namesake." Guy explains, quite truthfully.

The two partners exchange glances. "That's conclusive with the imprints on his body. And that's what the uniform said." They ease to their feet, Lowery stepping over and offering to shake. "Thanks, Mr Neville."

Guy stands up and shakes. "Yeah no problem guys... hey listen, if you two ever need any help, be sure and let me know. I'm one of the goodguys." He smiles good naturedly, "Of course, sometimes bein' one of the goodguys means PB&J for lunch and dinner."

Riggs smiles wryly. "You're doing the small stuff, and sometimes the most difficult things; the ones we drop and weed out. You eat off our scraps. Good luck with that. If we can, we'll send something your way."

Guy gives a bit of a grin, "Hey, food is food. I'll appreciate any scraps ya send my way." Guy gives a bit of a salute with the sandwich, "Have a good day gentlemen."

The two nod, and head out. And now, Guy has an actual client to call.
