The rest of the day itself was uneventful, if mob extortion shakedowns and ringing the Champions' doorbell was enough. The Ghost Knight had prior obligations that evening; a test the next day, to be precise. The detective had an actual case to work on - his distraction earlier in the day. Lydon had actually called Tia back, and has a few trusted assistants doing tests on her - matters of measuring capabilities for new parts, then beginning to work on those new parts. Not to replace, but with the ability to interchange different aspects and weaponry, it takes creating those.

To the shadowed member of the party, the night was open to interpretations. However, events indeed happen through the course of the evening. Petty thefts, robberies and burglaries have been reported across the city in record numbers within the last two weeks. Oddly enough, some of the most eccentric of those have been the Mayor's desk, a city mailbox, and the hat from a mascot sign outside of a steakhouse. Also, the most noteworthy of all, the destruction of a building in a super brawl. Fortunately the building was empty, but the resulting battle between two unknown individuals caused the building to collapse.

Also appearing in the Millenium City Chronicle the next morning is an interview between Lydon Yamaguchi and Christine Green. Highlights of the interview include Lydon's future plans for the Yamaguchi Corp, current new advancements in research by his company, and a hint that his funded Powersuiting hero, Tengu, is willing to work with fellow heros when the situation suits it; rumors about the affiliation between Tengu, Ghost Knight, and other heros were confirmed, but merely in that it was a joint effect to undermine the New Purple Gang, not ongoing teamwork.

Also, when GK retrieves his radio for the day after the test - blowing said evaluation tool out of the water - he discovers that Shawntae has news for him. The hearing for Dew's case has been had that morning, and the court date is set for Monday, meanwhile the board members and select members of the company are currently kept under lock and key for, among other things, fear of assassination due to mentioning organized crime affiliations.

Thomas doesn't seem particularly surprised to hear this. **Thanks,** he replies to the news. **Just in case... I'll be around as well, in case someone tries something the police can't handle.**

"Lydon's got me reading some programming books for the **slow** way. So I've been tinkering with a program that will alert me when certain keywords are said on the police scanner feed I have going into my computer. So I'll let you know if something comes up."

Thomas nods again. **That will be immensely helpful.**

Guy, having checked the phone records on DarkGlow's cellphone, finds an oddity. One or two of the times DarkGlow has mentioned he recieved a call... he has no call. Not in the phone records. Another was from a payphone.

Ghost Knight visits Dr Kiefer again. As it turns out, there were some interesting characteristics from the bone analysis. A few were missing persons, naturally. One was at least sixteen years old. However, the most odd of the bunch was one by a Carline Gotti. Who was reported dead in 1999 in Atlanta Georgia. However, the bones are freshly decomposed, the skeleton charred in places suggesting skin and flesh was burned off, before buried. The damage can be dated only months ago.

**Thank you, Doctor,** says the Ghost, crisply, once he's learned everything he needs to. **I leave it to you to decide if, when and how to report these incidents to the authorities. As for 'something for me', allow me...** From his sleeve he produces a business card, etched with the same number and note as the Champions received, but offered in a much less showy fashion - this time, Tom has fewer people to impress. When theatrics are useful, they are used; when he deals with a more practical personality, practicality is the surest path to results.

"I'm supposed to report these to the police," She informs. "It's also proper to find out where the skeletons are so that the families may have all of the remains that exist to bury." She merely looks over her glasses while collecting the card. "Then again, I don't know if your The Incognito have plans for the place where these were found."

**I have no plans that cannot accommodate the retrieval of the skeletons en masse, and there are few indeed who are capable of stopping me from doing so,** says the Ghost, confidently enough. **I will see to it.**

Nodding, Kiefer gestures back to the paper with Carline Gotti's information. "Would you like to keep this? It raised my brows; I can just imagine what it does for yours."

Thomas spends a few moments poring over the paperwork. He then looks up. **I now have it. The physical paper is immaterial. It will be looked into.**

"Mmkay," She returns, taking a sip of her coffee. "Don't be a stranger. But more importantly, don't be a customer."

A little later, GK is putting his radio-call through to DarkGlow, either in a direct connection or by proxy to teh cell phone. **I am going to Preche Island. Reputed to be haunted, but only by smugglers and killers it seems. Interested in helping me remove some buried skeletons?** he says, in response to the answer.

"Huh," DarkGlow answers into his phone. He glances once more over the busy techs from his corner sentry position in the lab Tia is being worked on. They seem to have gotten used to him popping in out and asking odd questions about what they're doing, but even so an occasional furtive look is shot his way. _Is a plain black cloak that unnerving?_ he wonders. His eyes drift back to the opened metal torso of Tia. He no longer shudders regarding it, but even so it seems... wrong, android or no. And she'd agreed so docilely to the procedure, he had half convinced himself she either didn't understand what was requested or didn't have any effective means of refusing. Somewhere deep in his heart he doubted she could really look after herself. _Eh, doesn't matter. Looks like they're not doing anything... dubious._ His attention returns to the phone. "Sure. I always wanted to try my hand at gravedigging. None of your 'relatives', I hope."

**I imagine not,** replies the Ghost. **The dead sometimes return to correct injustices, of just the sort we will be setting right. I am more concerned, though, with interference from the living. Come carefully.**

"Don't I always?" DarkGlow replies sardonically. "I'll bring a shovel--just in case. It's already deep enough, anyway. See you there."

The scruffy vegetation dots just off the shoreline on Preshe Island. The treeline in the distance is dense with spring leaves, but even in the daylight, there is a sense of wildness, of things hidden behind the shadows of the trees. The island sits in the Detroit River, near one of the great lakes, a dot situated in the center of the moving waterway.

Thomas is waiting as close to the center of the burial site as he can manage, with a series of old, salvaged blankets rolled up nearby.

DarkGlow looks over the blankets. "So what poor bastards got themselves buried here, anyway?"

Thomas shrugs. **Victims of the smugglers, or smugglers themselves who were betrayed. I intend to ask Guy to investigate the matter, when he's free.** The vigilante is attending to something, sweeping beneath the earth for the buried remains. **We'll start here,** he says, and stretches out a hand, as the earth begins carefully to move away from the interred remains.

The earth moves, baring the bones beneath, dusty and clung to by the sandstone of the surrounding ground. They are cracked, old with time beneath the surface. A breeze sweeps over the two, cool and subtle, stirring dirt about the pair's feet.

DarkGlow watches the earth surrender its hidden contents for a few seconds, before asking, "Was there anything you wanted me to do, other than wait for someone to possibly stop by and object? I've never tried, mind you, but I see no reason why my shadows can't dig into the earth."

**Unroll those blankets,** directs GK. **Mostly I wanted to tell you what brought me to this place, since I intend to continue investigating the matter, and am interested in assistance. Feel free to try digging. There are buried goods over yonder --** A gloved hand points the way. **\-- which I recommend for digging practice, if you are interested.**

DarkGlow opens his mouth and closes it. _What's the bleedin' use?_ Shaking out the blankets--and firmly not shaking his head--he not-quite-grates out, "Nothing too breakable, I hope."

**Nothing we have any use for,** clarifies the Ghost, as he extracts the first set of bones gingerly from the ground. **Sand and dirt are odd things to move. Much easier, and much harder, than true solids. In any event...** And with that, Tom begins to briefly summarize the Chinatown trip, the weapons he found, the soil samples, their trail back to the island.

As Darkglow stands and listens, the wind blows harder. It rips at his jacket, smacking it against his legs, plucking at hair. But even as it dies, the cold remains, not one of lacking heat, but a frigidness that digs into the bone, a feeling of something, like a shadow falling over him. Branches and leaves rustle, some silent wind must have passed through them... yet the sound is almost like mocking laughter.

_Naturally. I forget for a couple of days that I'm being haunted, and then I blissfully wander into a_ hidden graveyard _full of_ murder victims_. My brains are turning to mush, I swear they are._ Swallowing any response to GhostKnights superhero-investigation-type exploits, other than a grunted "Huh.", he walks over to where skullface had directed him and not-so surrepticiously gathers to himself as much shadow as he can. _Come on, then. Let's get this over with._

Cold. Like the shadow master had drank two milkshakes straight, and the chill is eminating from the inside. There is merely the feeling of the presence. A weight in the air, a taste of must and death. Water laps at the edge of the isle. That feeling though, that tranquil darkness seems to be growing, like some rolling tide creeping forward. And Darkglow's cell phone rings.

Shadows rip at the ground in a reflexive action, and DarkGlow doesn't bother trying to stop an explosive curse reminiscent of the sudden gout of earth now settling before him. "Damn place must be getting to me," he tells GhostKnight by way of explanation, fumbling with unsteady hands at his belt. "What?" he demands angrily when he finally gets the device to his ear.

Thomas, with two skeletons safely ensconced in their blankets, looks up curiously.

That familiar voice. But instead of the normal condescending superiority, or the angry frustrating, it is cold. "You do realize we see what you see, Don't you?"

DarkGlow emits a sound between a sigh and a growl. "And...?"

"And," Continues the voice in his earpiece, "You've spent the evening watching mechanical surgery? Do you just not understand the idea of an order? Or do you have to be reminded Why you are under our thumb?"

Shadows writhe as if strangling someone. "And you just got off the can or something and decided to call me _now_?! I'm kinda on the clock at the moment.

"And you never get off of our clock," Concludes the other voice calm and cold. "Find out who Tengu is. You have twenty four hours. When you have the answer, write it on a piece of paper, and just look at it."

Ghost Knight, realizing something absently, as his arc of perception once more sweeps over the area, expecting some trouble. His memory is jogged. There was planks and rotted wood tossed around aimlnessly inside the burnt out husk, but now, one or two have been moved. Further investigation of this oddity proves useful; probing finding a piece of paper beneath the burnt wood. Walking off, and into the remnants of the house, hands part, lifting the wood easily. The slip of paper, covered in dark powder to mask it among the blackened floor. A wave of the hand brushes it off, baring upon the dark paper white lettering, in Chinese.

"Oh, for--" DarkGlow spits out. _Ah, screw careful._ "Don't you read the bloody papers? Lydon Yamaguchi has the wonderful interview. _Yes,_ I know Yamaguchi. _Yes,_ I'm one of the other 'heroes'. _Yes,_ I know Tengu. _Yes,_ he's really cool. _Yes,_ Yamaguchi built or sponsors or whatever Tengu. He's a lot brighter than I am. Clear enough? And finally, _no_, I can't get you his autograph. Or mine. Or GhostKnight's. Stop asking. And please don't call me when I'm on the clock. I didn't give you this number so you could call me whenever you're feeling bored." His voice may have calmed and quieted over the tirade, but his heart's now a triphammer in his ears. A glance over his shoulder doesn't reveal GhostKnight, but even so... _Bloody bastard, calling me now._

"This isn't a leisure thing. I'm you're _Keeper_." The words don't sound very pleasant, seems like someone is displeased with his job. "I don't like calling you any more then you enjoy hearing from me. You're a wasted effort. But my superior thinks otherwise, so you are kept around. Remember that. So you're saying that Tengu is Lydon Yamaguchi?"

_Well, probably, at that. He built the suit, he's flown it, no 'pilot' shows up at our little sessions and anyone bright enough to be given Tengu to fly is bright enough to contribute useful ideas. And he did disappear right in the middle of the CAT battle. But frankly, I don't care about any of that...._ DarkGlow makes his voice go as light and cheery as his thoughts are black. He even briefly chuckles. "Apology accepted. And, yeah, he told me so himself." _Bite, you prick!_ "Weren't you listening?" he asks, sweetly.

"You havn't dialed his cellphone number lately," He serves back. "If Lydon is not Tengu, it's your ass." The dial tone hums in DarkGlow's ear. But even with the hum, he can still feel it, that feeling. That presence. It had never fled, never dissolved during the conversation - his mind was just distracted elsewhere. The shadows at DarkGlow's feet are almost bubbling; writhing like the sun were flickering to make them dance.

_'Dialed his...'? What does--_ His eyes widenly suddenly, and humour jabs into his mind. His teeth are bared in a jagged smile. _Only on a cell you've tapped. Thanks so very much, twit. I won't be able to 'look' into digging you up, but I guess I can ask others to do my prying. Not my style, but whatever the hell works, eh?_ He snaps the cell closed and drops it back into a pocket. He worries for a moment that he should have actually dug a bit more into Tengu, perhaps confirmed his theories, but he dismisses the feeling quickly. _I'll just have to work quickly to find an opener to the slime's can of worms, before he can confirm anything. And if I'm right, so much the better._ He looks again over his shoulder, but still no GhostKnight. _Let him think what he wants--I already know what I'll say if he asks._ And, finally, he coldly regards the slithering shadows at his feet. _Go away,_ he tells the presence. _I'm ignoring you, if that's all you're gonna do._

In the distance, within the treeline, the shadows move. Flicker, glide, the silluettes of movement gliding among them, then gone again.

Curiosity and fear spark in his mind, but anger still rules. _That a challenge, little ghost? Fine, then._ He strides to the trees, eyes and shadow-sense alert. _It's not me you should be angry at. It's the ass on the other end of my phone. Or someone like him. It's they who actually killed you, not me. I was just the blade--theirs was the hand._

Like only a few times before, the shadows almost feel like they're calling DarkGlow. He's aware of every ounce of shadow in the forest, where darkness hides from the light. They writhe as he passes. The glimpse of something else is far away, moving back as he moves closer. Seeming to be just behind a tree many feet away. And he's all too aware of the shadow of that tree, like an open door.

With a force of will, DarkGlow pushes aside the shadows in the area surrounding the tree, isolating it. To any other observer, the ground must suddenly look very strange, like a cartoon, or badly rendered computer image. To DarkGlow, it just means that what was once there, lying dormant, now pulses as power in his mind. Lively power. _Eager_ power. But even so... His fingers trace the outline of a flare on his belt. Two of them. Three. _Enough light will burn away shadow... but how did I come to possibly needing to?_

The shadows flee, leaving the ground bright with the sunlight. The tree, isolated, is... empty. Only in the distance, far beyond the clearing of light, barely registered. A definet figure. It doesn't look like anything solid, or anything see through... Like a ... fringe. A ripple, moving away.

Eyes narrowed, teeth clenched, DarkGlow knows the shape is too far away to merely run after. _Fine, then. So be it._ The space just in front of him fills with shadow. _I don't trust this,_ a quiet part of his mind speaks out. _I don't care!_ he tells it, savagely. He steps into, pushes into, the shadow.

And when DarkGlow thinks he would step out the other side, something happens. Or rather, doesn't happen. He's somewhere not on the other side of the light, somewhere dark, unyielding. Cold. And there are voices.

The shadows open. DarkGlow falls out onto the dirt onto the spot he had intended to find himself in. Darkness clings to the trees around him, and the sky is twilight, that dying umbra blue just before full night. Grime, dirt, blood. Like some sickening brew it clings to his body, under the clothes, on the clothes.

Anger disappates to be replaced by weariness as DarkGlow surveys his current condition. _Ah, hell. Saying "that's strange" is redundant, and something like "this isn't fair" borders on idiotic considering fair play and myself aren't on speaking terms._ He stares fitfully around, hoping but not really expecting to see anything else unusual. Finally, he just shrugs and turns around. _Next time, if you're going to bother, at least make it somewhat interesting, okay?_ he mentally calls to whatever's listening. Or emtpy air. At the moment he couldn't see how it mattered either way. _Ghostly laughter, visual flickers--these aren't scary. They're silly. When you're ready to do your worst, I assume you know where to find me. Meantime, I'm just going home. Have a good night. Or don't. Right now, I don't really care._ No even bothering to mutter under his breath, he trudges back to where GhostKnight may or may no longer be.

No sign of the Ghost Knight. The island is pretty much empty. Dark. It feels desolate and unwelcoming. A glance upwards can spot that the moon is slowly waning, and in a week, it will be little more then a sliver, 'gone'. The cell phone rings.

DarkGlow can't even muster a sigh. He drags out the cell and lifts it to his ear. "Hi. I'm not taking calls at the moment. Leave a message. Or don't. Actually I'd rather you didn't. Just go away and leave me alone. Beep."

"Cute. Very cute," Notes the voice inside the phone. "Don't ever hide from the cameras again. We don't know how you did it, we don't care. Do not disconnect the video feed again, or we'll have to take serious measures." Click.

With a shrug, the cell is returned to DarkGlow's belt. His head lolls back on his neck, and he stares blankly upwards. _Guess I won't be asking Bozos Inc. where I've been. For a moment--well, if I'd thought of it--their cameras might actually have been slightly useful for once. And naturally there's no point in trying to persuade them I_ wasn't _attempting to evade their tracking, though God knows I probably should be. Tell Lydon I developed a new bug and see if he can find the signal or something. But what I'm wanting to know right now is if my phantom friend was actually_ trying _to get me into trouble. Was their 'attack' interesting after all?_ A hand absently rubs his belly. _Screw it. Dinner's more important methinks. And a shower._

Though, as he thinks about it, another breeze floats through the trees, shaking the limbs. And this time, it isn't merely the mocking laughter of before. DarkGlow can almost hear NightStar's laughter slither through his ears, that high pitched almost child-like laugh that said she was doing something she Knew was wrong.

DarkGlow drops into a combat crouch. It's pure reflex--there's nothing that he can do about that. As soon as his spinal column releases control of his nervous system, however, he stands again. _Masters and phantoms and NightStar, oh my. If I had a pocket nuclear device right now, I'd detonate it. I swear I would._ "I though freebies were anathema, dearest," he calls. "Why don't you go play with someone you'd get paid for messing with? Or did someone actually send you after me? Either way, believe it or not, you aren't the biggest worry in my life at the moment, but if you went away for a week or two, I promise I'd be able to give you my full attention."

There's the caw of a crow somewhere in the woods, and the hum of cicadas, but otherwise, silence.

"Is that a yes?" DarkGlow calls plaintively, after a moment. _Odd. Her tongue's sharper than her blades, and she never misses a chance to cut me with it--even if I now refuse to just stand and bleed silently for her._ He should probably go look, but at the moment even going through the motions is beyond him. _I'm wondering if that should be 'Masters and phantomish NightStars' instead._ His mind locks onto a far shadow, off the island, but he can't resist a final glance at the woods. _Priest or shrink. I should probably decide soon._

Books sprawled across Tom's couch, going over the Chinese language, his radio squaks. "Um, Ghost Knight? You there? Calling all dead men."

**Nihao,** replies GK, tongue just slightly in cheek. **Speak.**

"Yeah," Continues Shawntae. "Lydon wants you. Now."

Thomas packs his books up 'no hands' as he gives his assent into the radio. And with that he's off. What does the man want now..?

Lydon is waiting for the Ghost Knight, obviously perturbed. He is at home, in his personal office. On his desk are spread out papers. As the Ghost arrives, Lydon turns. "We need to talk." From the look on his face, he isn't happy - anger, or... nervousness seems to cling to his features.

Thomas gestures with a black-clad hand. **Speak,** he says casually enough. Could this be about the Champions situation? Surely it didn't cause THAT much trouble...

Lydon reaches behind him, grabbing a small stack of papers, and hands them to the Ghost. "Read." They are college transcripts. Grades. Tom's grades. Actually, they are Tom's exact grades, but also two years ahead of him. According to this, the person is a grad student at Tom's university. "I recieved this in the mail. Not to mention," A second page is handed. It reads, "Lydon, this might be of interest. This is the current information on your Phantom friend. Ask him about them, because you won't find them in the records. But he is there."

Thomas's hand lifts; the papers slide effortlessly into the air, arranging themselves for inspection. **I recognize what these are,** he says at last, collating the sheets into a single perfect stack and floating them back to the desk. **What of them?** he then asks. A singular, clear, emotionless question, while inside Tom is seething. Is this another one of Dad's tricks? It doesn't feel like it. But if not, then who? And how..?

Lydon hands a final piece of paper. On it, it simply reads, "Mr Yamaguchi, you are Tengu. We can bicker about it back and forth, but I know where the suit is. I know you are the driver. And I know the Ghost Knight is your ally. Show him the information I have provided."

Thomas nods as he finishes reading this. **I have not spoken of the matter to anyone. Period,** he says, divining at last the real reason for this meeting. **I will give you whatever assurance you require, within reason.**

A shake of Lydon's head. "That's not the problem. My problem is this. If its right about _me_, is it right about You?" He points to the papers. "If whoever this is knows my secret, has evidence, then why else would they give me a random college student's GPA?" He looks utterly furious and worried at the same time.

Thomas suddenly realizes a way out, and he laughs softly in that dark, dead voice. **Mr. Yamaguchi, you must have realized that the man I once was could not be conversant with your culture. I have spent some of my time receiving education from certain allies and informants. I know who these grades refer to, upon reflection. So you may take this information as factual within its limits - somebody knows of us, but not wholly. I may even be able to aid you with the Lydon/Tengu deception, if you are interested.**

"I'm not worried about my own safety," Lydon says as he walks behind the desk. "Because it wouldn't hurt me too much. I can defend my actions, and I feel rather safe. However, if this is your identity, or someone very close to you, then this knowledge threatens you. If they know this person's grades, they no doubt have every other thing about this person, too." A wry smile. "And if those grades were yours... I was tempted to just offer you a job."

**I will relay the offer. I am satisfied with my own 'career choice', if you will,** says GK with a dry chuckle, **but a poor college student deserves better, and I have an obligation to repay him for what I have demanded. I have repaid him somewhat already, and you will understand how if you meet him.** He turns, then pauses. **I will investigate this breach, to the best of my ability.**

A mere nod from the Patron. "I'm going to call everyone in." He lifts from behind his desk a laptop. "This came with a note attached that everyone should be around when it's started up. I don't want Shawntae poking his nose into something that might explode. Or if our friend is aware of Shawntae too, there might be something on there that could scar him if he probed it. I don't know; I'm not messing with this until we get everyone in masse, and put this behind a nice, safe barrier."

Thomas nods. **Understood.**
