# Millennium City Chronicles 2003-09-15

Everyone has been assembled. Lydon had gotten in touch with DarkGlow and Guy via their radios, informing them to come to his home, pronto. All have assembled in the basement, and behind an impromptu wall with safety glass - something Ghost Knight made easy use of - sits a laptop.

**The device contains no explosive compound I am familiar with,** says the Ghost, not at all reassuringly given the circumstances. **Nevertheless, I am not omniscient.**

DarkGlow's widen slightly at the sight. "Ah. Did we go and lift the airport guy's laptop anyway?"

"No," Lydon says with a shake of his head. "This was delivered to my office."

Guy assembles! The detective looks about carefully, his coat looking cleaner than it had been in a while. Having a case has been good to the detective, it seems. He smiles, "So... er what's the big urgent hurry to get here? Who delivered the computer to your office, Mr. Lydon? Or why?"

"I don't know." The corporate head seems rather angry about that fact. "Whoever it is, they know I'm Tengu's pilot, and they've found out other things regarding our operations here."

DarkGlow jerks his head over to Lydon. "_You're_ Tengu's pilot? I thought you'd just built it and done some test piloting and stuff."

Guy blinks, several times. "Er... sir? Y-you're the pilot of that flying tin can? Huh. Impressive. Most impressive. So... what else do they know? And, moreover, what do they want?"

"I don't know," He says, the tone finalizing the statement. Turning to the Ghost Knight, "Could you open and turn on the laptop? Let's find out what's on it."

GK inclines his head, and gestures. Beyond the safety enclosure, the laptop clicks open, slowly rising. It comes fully open, and the vigilante presses the "Power" button remotely.

DarkGlow stares at the laptop as it powers up. _Lydon answered Guy and ignored me. Should I be worried? Eh, why bother? It's not like I actually knew he was the pilot. I think I should worry more about who sent that laptop..._

The screen blinks to life, slowly booting up. Then a window pops up, requesting a password.

Thomas gestures to Shawntae. **My skills have sufficed until now; his must serve you from here,** he says flatly.

Shawntae leans forward slightly, and Lydon holds up his hand. "Cool your jets. I don't know who I'm dealing with, and they may have something nasty that could hurt **your** mental fingers." A frown. "Why would they send a password guarded computer, if they didn't give us the password?"

Guy looks over. "Huh. So uhm, I'm guessing you thought something bad was gonna happen? Well, if it's some small comfort to ya, whoever it is that sent this and knew about it, probably had figured we'd put it up behind some kind of safety thing. So if it was gonna do anything, it'd probably take that into account. Or something. So uh..."

Guy suggests helpfully, "Try, one, two, three, four, five."

DarkGlow tries chuckling but can't seem to get his throat to work right. After a noiseless second, he shrugs and says, "If it was sent to Lydon and they know so much about him, I'd say use Lydon's computer password."

Shawntae looks sideways at Guy, before nodding, and the suggestion is punched in. "I think I'm pretty safe of just putting the numbers in," He defends, and the 'okay' is clicked. A second window pops up, informing of the error. Below the error message is a tree stump, the word "Stumped?" written on it. Beneath that is the box for the next password.

Thomas pauses a moment, then speaks. **The laptop itself is the message. This is someone laughing at us. Proceed; I doubt we will fail to penetrate, although it might be very insulting before we succeed.**

Guy watches the laptop curiously. _Hmmm. Lydon's password... I just hope that's not 1, 2, 3, 4, 5..._ "So er... maybe the password is Stumped? Or it's one of those twits who likes to prove they're smarter than everyone by sending them cryptic insulting messages. Geez."

Lydon says, "Do it, Shawntae." The hacker nods, and the window melts away. Immediately a window pops up, a program used for playing videos. Play is clicked without aid from the cyberkinetic. A few seconds of processing complete, before on the screen is a figure. It looks a mob informant being interviewed - their whole face and most of their body is in shadows. From the looks of it, the physique is male, though not wide in shoulders. Hands are steepled on a desk. "Hello," is said, but it's very quiet. Shawntae makes a grunt, and the voice gets louder. "If you're seeing this, obviously DarkGlow got my message."

Guy turns his head, as if on cue, towards DarkGlow. "You got a message from this joker?"

Thomas listens impassively, waiting for more detail.

DarkGlow's eyes narrow suddenly at the screen. His hand goes involuntarily to a pocket. _Son of a--_ His head tracks slowly over to GhostKnight. The shape of the folded envelope presses through the fabric of his cloak. _I wasn't gonna play messenger boy, but..._ He withdraws the letter and steps towards the deathly figure. "If you ever want help taking care of your 'friends', I'll be glad to help out," he whispers.

Lydon just turns to look at DarkGlow, while the movie plays on. The voice is deep, almost echoed. "First, I'll note that any tracing of this is not going to work. The location this is filmed at could be anywhere. Nothing on the laptop itself couldn't have been done by a teenager of much less skill then your Mr. Howard. No fingerprints, and the computer has 'fallen off of a truck'. Also, Ghost Knight, my voice has been altered. I don't want you to make a fool of yourself imitating it for any reasons."

The Ghost waits, motionless as a statue, as the video continues. Not even DarkGlow's whisper seems to have registered.

Guy hehs. He watches the video, making note of what's been shot. "Arrogant little git. Although... hmmm."

The steepled hands spread. "Second, what can I say? I've wanted to speak to all of you personally for some time, especially you, Knight of the Crusade. But I didn't intend to make my presence known immediately anytime soon; my hand has been forced, however. But I'm getting ahead of things: allow me to introduce myself. I am Maximilian Moriarity. No, that is a complete and utter Alias, and few know of it, so questioning by that name will only generate confusion."

Guy hmmms. "Moriarty? Heheh. If he's Moriarty, then Holmes can't be far off... but... uhm. Well let's watch what he's got to say."

"Now, down to business." The screen flicks to a shot of Wilson Carter, the Dew Board member. He is in a solitary cell, a second shot of police guard outside. Four other pictures, of two men and similar guard duties, are given. It returns to Moriarity. "You are familiar with Wilson Carter. The other men are Theodore Bell, and Jonathan Burnson, both the remaining Dew Chemical Board members. All three of these men have a hit on them."

**And probably know it,** observes the Ghost, breaking his stony silence. But he says no more.

Guy nods, "Oh sure. Well, let's see what else they've got comin' their way..."

"By my resources, I have found this out, and I believe the assassination will take place during their transfer from jail to armored car to be taken to the trial hearing. Unfortunately I do not know who has taken the contract, but I do believe it has passed to the Chinese mafia; several of my eyes tell me that it's been claimed, but they can't find out who."

Guy ponders. "Well that's an easy solution then. Get a teleporting Champ, and tell 'em to 'port the guys from their cells to the trial hearing. No fuss, no muss, no assassination."

DarkGlow thinks of the other cell in his apartment, hidden and separate from its battery, and wonders if there's any point to using it again.

"I will keep my eyes and ears open to help you in this. I do not want these men killed, because they need to go to trial. Our motivations on this are the same, and I intend to assist you in this where I can. There is no telling who this contract has reached, those of normal thug reputation, science aided, or merely superhuman in nature. So even if they are not struck at this point and time, they very well could slip in through the walls, like many of your group."

"If you avoid the assassination attempt by other means, then they will just select a different time. If you strike one of the assassins, perhaps it may send a message to the others, or at the very least, raise the price of the contract to points that our contractors are not willing to pay."

"In any case, that's all I have. I will have those in my imploy monitoring the cells, or doing what they can to detect the subtlist of assassins, but my resources are not endless, and capabilities not boundless. You were involved in the capture, and are still interested in the conviction. I thought it would be best to let you know, and ally myself with you." With that, the screen grows blank.

DarkGlow frowns. _'Raise the price'? That'd be damn unprofessional. If you don't take into account likely opposition when you accept an offer, that's your problem..._

Guy hmmms. "So uh... thoughts? Anyone? What if we uh, solved the case? I mean... hmmm. HEY! Do you think that the laptop you saw has any connection with this thingy?"

The Ghost turns now to DarkGlow, empty eyesockets narrowed. **This was presumably the same man who phoned me once. What was his message to you?**

Guy says, "Hey, uhm, if the laptops are the same kind, here's another thing to consider. What if this guy actually **wants** these guys dead and is involving us to string us along a series of false leads so that we're elsewhere when these guys are assassinated?"

DarkGlow proffers the envelope. "This was delivered to me when I was out of my usual garb. I... dislike being followed and spied upon." His hand spasms, partially crumpling the paper, and ugliness leaks into his tone. "Violently so, sometimes." _Easy, you idiot!_ He steps back a pace, shaking his head and holding two fingers to a temple. "Sorry--it's been a rough few days."

Lydon just lets out a long sigh, and leans against the wall, shaking his head. Shawntae turns the computer off, and closes it. "I'll have it sweeped to see if he's missed anything."

Thomas takes the envelope, opens it and scans through it briefly.

Guy says, "I'll bet you he has, but not anything conventional scans'll find. We need to think quite oddly now. LIke y'know, Psi-Impressions and whatnot."

DarkGlow looks over at Lydon. "So you're not the only one with their ass hanging out for at least some to see. I'd ask it you felt any better, but it just makes _me_ feel more scared."

**Now is not the time to indulge in the comfort of fear,** retorts the Ghost. **Lydon. Any secret must be revealed in due course. Even mine. Until then, we have lives to safe. Let us act quickly.**

Lydon tries not to glare at DarkGlow, but shakes his head. "I'd like to know how he found out." Glancing to the Knight, he nods. "All right. So what do you make of it?"

Guy nods, "Oh sure. Well hmmm. Secrets revealed... I'll bet we all have some to reveal. Myself included. So yeah, we'll have a big picnic around a campfire and share secrets and sing kum-bayah. But... let's do this after we settle with this thing?"

**A loss for Dew is a loss for the mob, and hence a gain for Moriarty, assuming this is not some elaborate trap. Kings played their sons against each other in an earlier day; now the scions of crime and wealth do the same. I suggest we gain what advantage we can, which is the success of the trial.** The Ghost measures out time, motionlessly, considering further.

Lydon presses fingers into the bridge of his nose. "We're a team two weeks and all ready we're dealing with evil geniuses and puppetmasters. Great. Well, then, let's get to work."

DarkGlow adds, "If we can find the people who hired the assassins, we might find a lead on Mr. Moriarty just by knowing what group he's in opposition to." _And fear is not a comfort. What do you know of it? Anger is. And hatred is a pure balm. Fear just makes your belly hollow, and I feel like I've not eaten in a week._

Homestead, home of the Champions, is made with due haste. Mid afternoon. Guy dons something to hide his identity, while heading inside. They have to wait fifteen minutes, before Defender meets them, the blue and white of his armor matching the decore a little. "You're back. Nice to meet you," He calls to Guy all friendly like.

Thomas steps forward, again wearing the noble aspect of a human face aged four decades. "Assassins have been contracted to do away with the Dew members facing trial. We intend to protect them. The Chinese Mafia may be involved. They require the utmost protection possible."

Guy nods, "Nice to meetcha. And of course I'm back. Or we're back. So uhm, yeah. What he said. Assassins are going to try something or another, and there's reason to believe that the attempt will be made during the transfer to the armored car when they go to Trial."

DarkGlow just stands silently behind them, trying to keep even his breathing to a minimum.

The fact Defender wears a face mask likely shields some of the reaction. "All right. We'll see what we can do. And, I talked it over with everyone else. We'll work along side you, but, if the results of your work is severely illegal, we won't take credit for us, or we'll be liable. On the same coin, we'll not ask for anything in return. If we need help, it's up to you."

Thomas inclines his head just a bit. "The legality of our actions is our problem, not yours. You may call upon us for whatever you wish, I'm sure."

"Right," Defender adds. "Glad we see eye to eye here. We'll see what we can do; at the very least, some of us will be there." He extends his hand to the Ghost Knight.

Thomas replies in kind, shaking firmly and confidently. _At least something's going right for us,_ he thinks to himself.

---

Guy takes the day cruising Chinatown, and the adjacent area. Some watch him, but it's that innate sense that they are waiting for the purchase, instead of a loiterer. However, a few places give him some suspicious looks. One is a herbalism shop; herbs and spices, a shop for home remidies and the new age 'natural suppliments' along with some eastern leanings. And while some of it may appeal to tourists or health nuts, some of it appears authentic. A small kareoke bar, a grocer, and a few other smaller things trip his radar, but not overly so.

The Ghost Knight flows through the underbelly, the sewers and tunnels and basements. The stash of weapons have been altered - no speargun, no machineguns, and half the cop killers are gone. But two sawed offs and a grenade can be found inside. The spot that where many auras were gathered around is currently empty, but investigated: a basement with a sub celler, converted into a pit. Blood stains the ground. There are smaller tunnels in the pit, waist high, with cage doors blocking them off. Another search finds two small blocks of C-4. Nothing outragous jumps out at him, but he does stumble across what could be a hidden 'dojo', traces of blood, and charts with parts of the body marked for, what looks like, killing blows can be found.

DarkGlow has some better luck. In the basement of an apartment complex - a small thing - in a storage area, there is a map sprawled across a table, and it looks like blueprints of downtown. But there is no one around, no other evidence. He finds, among other things, two disassembled cars, and a minivan that has yet to be taken apart, but his senses just scream 'stolen'. Elsewhere, in the locked store room of a warehouse, is a body, sealed. He doesn't find anything else, however; darkness has crept into the sky, and as night sets in, and when he teleports out, he finds himself on the island once more.

DarkGlow goes down on one knew and fights to keep from vomitting. _Shadows are_ not _supposed to wrench like--_ His internal monologue dissolves into a small cry as he takes in his surroundings. Stiffening his spine with the courage left to him, he heaves himself to his feet and awaits his adversary's pleasure.

Of course, it doesn't come. DarkGlow is treated to the sound of an owl.

DarkGlow swallows a sigh and almost chokes. "Right," he manages. "Just a wrong turn at the last fork, then? I'll be on my way?" The last isn't meant as a question, but comes out as one all the same.

DarkGlow looks carefully into the not so distant trees. He sees nothing. He shrugs and turns away. He gathers shadow, but let's it lie fallow for a moment. He turns back. "I may not have faced you directly, but I never did this. I was never needlessly cruel." Facing the water once more, he feels the partition through the shadow, the link between near and far. And it is with trepidation that he steps through.

Guy informs everyone you know. "Here we go. So that's what I found out. Oh, and that certain people who think they can sing, really can't. In any case... here's where the spots were... any places connect?"

Guy hmmms. "Well it looks like the body was stored here... and uhm, the chopshop. Yeah interesting network of tunnels... but just 'cause they all don't match up doesn't mean we don't have solid leads to follow. The trick is... we don't have solid leads to follow."

**Some of the weapons were missing, of those I found earlier,** comments the Ghost. **Especially those that would be of use in an operation such as this. Hardly solid evidence. Still, we know where to look out for now.**

"So we split our time between here and guarding the execs?" asks DarkGlow, speaking up from the silence he'd fallen into. "Is that really a good idea?"

**The Champions can stand guard. But can you imagine Defender soiling his suit in the sewers we've just crawled through?** asks GK. **We'll be there, when everything happens. Until then, we may as well do what we can.**

Guy laughs. "Yeah... I can imagine it. In fact, I just DID imagine it. It's quite funny. You ought to try it." He ponders. "So what else should we do? I mean, do we have anyone to check on? Any sign of the guys who picked up the laptop again?"

DarkGlow glances at the detective, then frowns as he mentally tries to make the blueprints from the laptop he'd spied on in the Chinese restaurant match a jail.

DarkGlow shrugs, giving up the attempt as useless. "At least Chinese takeout is conveniently close by. Anyone else hungry?"

Guy nods, "I am, quite. Er, if someone else is buyin'."
