Thomas's phone had rung that morning. The Ghost Knight had given Lydon a phone number the night before to call. Thus, the philanthropist, mecha pilot and CEO called the mild mannered college student, and invited him over to the warehouse. The Ghost Knight, he said, had recommended the man, and Lydon was interested in seeing what he could do.

Everyone else was assembled. The day is young, and there are many things to do before tomorrow's sting, but this seemed of interest to Lydon. At the very least, someone who's resources could assist the team, or his company. But still, letting him meet everyone would help.

Thomas arrives at the warehouse, clad in his familiar college garb - the casual kid of 20 years, complete with backpack and haircut. He walks through the door, following the familiar black-clad form of the Ghost Knight himself. The two make their way slowly across the floor of the warehouse, the vigilante looking straight ahead and moving stiffly, the young man behind and beside him looking tense and strained. He seems nervous, or at least distracted. But who wouldn't be, under the circumstances. **This is Thomas Temple,** the Ghost's hollow voice resonates, from the air about the dark figure. "Hi," says that worthy, waving a hand uncertainly in greeting.

Lydon glances curiously at the Ghost Knight, then back to Tom, arms folded and a neutral expression on his face. He extends a hand to the man. "Hello. I'm Lydon Yamaguchi."

Guy raises a curious eyebrow as the kid walks along behind Ghost Knight. He looks at Lydon, then back at the kid. _Huh. Wonder what's up now? Some kinda... superhackermaybe? Or something._ The detective nods to GK, then to Thomas. "Hi, pleased to meetcha kid. The name's Guy. Guy Neville, actually. So what's your story?"

Thomas hesitates visibly before extending his own hand, and shaking. "So um, I'm not a superhero or anything, but I was told there was some sort of chance for good work here." He eyes Guy for a moment, then hmms audibly. "Hey, we meet again."

Lydon nods to Thomas. "Temple? Name sounds familiar, for some reason. Anyways, GK pointed me in your direction. You have... a really impressive set of grades. What do you want to do when you get out of college?"

DarkGlow barely glances up during the introductions, and says not a word. He hovers well away from the others, and is obviously reluctant to be present. Though his face, as always, remains hidden in the shadow of his cowl, the hunch in his shoulders and his lowered head perhaps hint at some inner anxiety--or perhaps conceal only his usual dark menace.

"That we do. I remember you from the park. You and Christine were dealin' with the Mafia goons, if I recall correctly. Not too bad, either." Guy then falls silent, and turns to Lydon. He cracks a smile. _Ah. New recruit? Well that's one explanation. But... what do you wanna do when you grow up? Yeesh._

Thomas laughs softly. "Haven't thought too much about that, Mr. Yamaguchi. I'm enrolled in a criminal justice program, and my father's a practicing psychiatrist, so... I'll probably become some sort of police scientist, doing forensics and stuff. But I have a lot of hobbies."

Lifting up some papers, Lydon looks over the grades. "I take it your hobbies include a lot of science... A Lot of science." Looking over the papers, "Do you have a job right now?"

Thomas shuffles around uncomfortably for a couple seconds, before answering. "Um, not really. I've been pretty busy. But that shouldn't be a problem now, if you have stuff for me to do."

"Well, we'll see about it. I wouldn't mind seeing what you know, let you take a tour of the facilities at the Yamaguchi building." A smile from the CEO, "What can I say. I know a potential scientist - or at the very least one doing it until he moves on - because the building needs it." He looks up at the Ghost Knight, not exactly saying anything, though.

Thomas brightens up and nods. "Sure, I can do that," he says. "I've still got classes to go to, so can a full tour wait for another day? But um, I guess I should tell you guys how all this happened, and..." He glances up to the dead-headed figure beside him, who inclines his head in silent assent. Tom continues: "Well, uh, this guy..." He nods left, towards the silent Ghost. "He... sorta came to campus, and found me, said because I was the smartest kid he'd seen so far.. Anyway, he taught me fighting and history, from a real unique perspective, and I taught him about what's going on today. Cars, telephones, you know, alla that."

Lydon nods at that, still watching the Ghost Knight. GK is awfully quiet, but he's not normally talkative. It seems over half the team is quiet and brooding. Just his luck, he picked the outcast table in the lunchroom of superheros. "Were you asleep for a long time, Ghost Knight?"

**For many years. I was called back by ritual, and told what I must do,** the dead pseudo-voice resonates. **Even the boy here has not been told the story.**

Another nod. "Well, that's all well and good. I just wanted you to meet everyone." Shawntae waves, as iff on cue.

Thomas waves, looking a little uncomfortable. "I guess this is everyone?" he asks.

Guy blinks. "Called back by ritual? Er... Ghost Knight? Uhm... ah nevermind. I'm sure it'd only make my head hurt." Guy shrugs, and nods. "Glad to see the Mafia didn't give you any more trouble kid." He then asks Lydon, "So does this mean we get the grand tour as well?"

"Well, as the Tom said, he can't today. If you want to tag along that day, you're welcome, but not today. There are things to do, isn't there?" Lydon shifts his stance, straightening up enough. "Or atleast, here's to hoping. And Tia's fitting should be done by this afternoon, hopefully."

DarkGlow doesn't even bother to snort or make a smart comment. In truth, the idea barely touches his mind. Instead wonders if this is really all Lydon had wanted them here for. _I shouldn't be here. I should be home and quietly medi--_ His thoughts break away from his grasp momentarily. _Shadow! It can control the-- No! Easy. Let it go._ Thoughts skitter madly for a second longer, and he steps back involuntarily before an enemy only in his mind. He shakes his head and looks around, hoping this meeting will end, and soon.

Thomas nods. "Anyway, I should get going, I gotta--" He is cut off by the cryptic voice of his benefactor. **Let's talk, Temple. Outside.** The ghost begins walking for the door, and Tom skitters nervously after him, casting one final glance back over his shoulder. Then the two are gone, presumably to speak outside the warehouse.

"Good good. Well then we'll uhm..." Guy blinks. "You suppose the kid's alright? Oh I'm sure he'll be fine, maybe. So what's next on the list of things to do? Darkglow? You up for a bit of takeout? I had thought we could check the places we prowled around at yesterday. Maybe the Karaoke bar? I'm sure GK has a beautiful singing voice." _He can't hear through walls... right?_

DarkGlow twitches at his name. It takes him a second to lock onto Guy's figure. "No, I-- Sorry, I must... must go. I have things..." He shrugs, helplessly, and steps backward again.

Guy says, "You have things? You know there's a spray for that..." Guy shrugs. "Well if you've got things, then you've got things. Uhm, if ya want any help, lemme know. Otherwise, I'll go see what I can dig up regarding assassins and such. I've a couple of contacts in the police department I might hit up for information."

Again the door opens, this time with the Ghost Knight alone. He walks evenly across the floor, back toward the group. **I've instructed him in discretion,** the vigilante says, shortly. **Lydon, you know how to reach him now. Set whatever appointments you need.** He raises a gloved hand, index finger pointing almost toward the industrialist. **One thing. Questions about me are asked of me. Not him.**

Lydon just nods to the Ghost Knight. "Right. I understand. Sorry I pushed. But, what can I say. You are a mystery, hey?" Hands find his pockets as he pushes away from the wall. A sideglance towards DarkGlow, "Well, I'm sure you three will make progress."

**Send a mystery to solve another,** remarks GK. **Gentlemen. May I suggest that we.. relax somewhere?** An odd, almost incongruous remark, considering its source.

Guy nods. "Way ahead of you GK... but Darkglow says he's got things. And you know how troublesome things can get. It might just be you and I."

DarkGlow's head remains fixed on Guy, and the word 'assassin' resonates in his skull like an accusation. It builds like a crescendo into a point of pain behind his eyes. He steps backward, hands coming up but he can't decide whether to cover his ears or his eyes. He steps again, and this time it takes him into contact with the wall behind him. The touch is light, on his left shoulder from how his body happened to be angled. A startled cry catches in his throat and he whirls, right hand bladed and arcing under the guard of an opponent who is not there. His hand buries itself deeply into the metal wall.

Thomas blinks, inside his armor, still sweating himself from the exertion of animating his alter-ego's shell. And now this.... **What is the matter?**

Guy just blinks... "Whoa... hey... you alright?"

Shawntae blinks. "Someone's got issues."

DarkGlow looks down dumbly. His mind is quiet, except perhaps for a faint echo of laughter. He sees how far into the wall his blade actually penetrated and through the shadow coating his skin, he feels how he'd made the wall's material part. It's really not so different from parting flesh. "Oh," he says in a child-like, whispery voice. "Is that how it's done? I'll have to remember." He pulls his hand free, and turns around. His heart hammers in his chest, but the feeling is distant, unimportant. "Excuse me," he says. "I didn't sleep too well last night." He moves a little ways toward the door, then turns and adds, "I think I'll go home and take a nap." And few more steps, then he turns toward Ghost Knight. "If you'd fix that," he says, nodding toward the gaping slash in the wall, "I'd appreciate it." He again begins heading toward the door.

Guy blinks. "Whoa. Uhm... hey uh... what?" Guy is still kind of stunned. "Well uhm... that was unexpected. Hey you alright? Are you sure sleep's your only trouble? If you need help you can ask us, after all... or not. Well... uhm, take care then?"

GK inclines his head. **Confession is good for the soul. So is solitude. Choose whichever suits your needs most,** he says quietly, while moving toward the damaged wall to do as his teammate requested.

Lydon watches all of this with quiet perplexedness. Gaze following DarkGlow out, he wears a deep frown, and then starts walking the other way.

Guy calls up his police buddies, Lowry and Riggs. They havn't delt too much with professional hitters. They don't know anything about the Triads, but the police are a big network, and they will see what they can do. Heading into Chinatown, Guy finds it's rather quiet. Other then the tourists. Though, on his radio he can hear Shawntae filtering in. "Hey guys. Got something interesting for you."

Guy hmms. He speaks over the radio, "Yeah Shawntae? Whaddaya got? And where are ya... I'll be over there as fast as I can..."

"Nono, don't worry about coming over. This is just FYI. First of all, it turns out Sorelli, remember, the mob boss? He died last night. Says here complications of pnmonia. Secondly, the Champs called." Shawntae informs.

"Oh? Sorelli? Hmmm. That ought to create a power-vacuum. Things'll be bloody in the next few days. What's up with Champs then?" asks Guy, looking rather curious.

Shawntae continues. "Well, apparently there's a gas leak in the courthouse. So all of Monday's stuff is cancelled. However, this is only known between the head judge over the Courthouse, the forman who's going to fix it, and the Champs. They want to know if we'd be interested in setting up a sting for tomorrow. Since there's no court hearing, we could use decoys."

Guy says, "We could... but what if the Gas Leak was caused by members of the Triad so that we'd go set up a sting, and they could draw out any opposition, and know what they're dealin' with? Hmmm."

Guy says, "I'm up for it though."

Guy says, "I'd also be careful of a leak in the court system. But not the gas kind, if you catch my meaning."

"No idea," Shawntae says. "I'll try and get ahold of everyone and see what they think before I call them back, I guess."

Another voice comes over the radio link. **Decoys would be useful. Have them make it happen,** suggests the Ghost.

Shawntae's voice comes over the line. "All right big G."

Sitting in the center of his apartment, DarkGlow breathes quietly and attempts to marshes his thoughts behind closed eyes. his cloak and gloves lay neatly on his bed in the corner, and the pale light of candles glows softly on his pale skin in the otherwise blackened room. Two days it had taken for the reaction to set in, two days of sleeplessness and broken meditation. Even so, it probably wouldn't have affected him so if they hadn't shunted him back to that damned-- _No. Calmly._ To that island again.

Oh, it probably wasn't really 'they' he knew. Just a single vengeful ghost. He found he could no longer pretend it was all in his mind, though that would have been more of a relief. But that one's laughter had a way of multiplying in his heda, such that it became a chorus of souls reaching back at him.

And it really didn't bother him that he was now suddenly _haunted_. It wasn't as if... unpleasant companions hadn't been by his side since his earliest days. The only really special things about this particular companion was that there was no one to slice apart, verbally or physically, and it seemed no way to simply run away.

Oh, and of course the trick it had with manipulating shadow.

Emotion rose up and threatened to cascade through his neurons. Savagely supressing the wave would probably work, and had worked for countless years, but this last while had shown him that this was more damaging than helpful. And not just this latest sojoun in the city running with his new 'teammates'. Really, it had been since breaking with NightStar and being alone for the first time since he'd met her.

She could laugh long and hard with him, and be as friendly as anyone he'd ever known, but she could also hammer at him with her words and eyes and personality. And how could he stand up to her? He'd had to suppress whatever was running in his brain at those times, and conform that what she wanted. Or be blown away by the sheer force of her.

And now he was alone. Suppressed emotions would spike and it was purely a relief to ride them with not a care. Or so it had been for a while.

Fear and anger and frustration surged and he let himself be borne by them. Here, in his room, there was nowhere they could take him that would be dangerous. And in exploring them, not simply reacting to them, he could find their real meaning.

Somewhere, a memory bubbles up to the surface of DarkGlow's mind. Blood, lots of blood. Shadows moving like a swirling whirlwind of darkness around two people, reducing them in short order to things unrecognizable. Then something more recent, like a movie projector. The men he'd killed with his own weapon of choice, and in each one they're laughing at him.

"You're already dead," DarkGlow states simply, canting his head slightly as if addressing a figure in front of him but off to one side. "You will wait. Or you will finish it now." Setting aside the images, he concentrates again.

Fear was primal, wired into his core. Really, there was no point in fighting it. Survival is always paramount to the subconscious, to the animal inside him, and threats to that inspire fear. When this phantom threatened him, directly or otherwise, fear was a logical result. And yet he would die someday anyway. Everyone did, and enough had under the power of his shadows that he had illusions as to his own mortality. What did it truly matter when he died? His life had become... complicated these days anyway. Some would call it justice, too. Perhaps he would as well, someday.

Anger is less primal, more conscious. And yet how was it different that the petulant stamping of a child? So the phantom woudln't go away, so it wouldn't obey him, so he couldn't simply thrust it aside of be rid of it. This was as fair as any time in which another's life ended by his actions. He was never fair, why should it? Some might call it justice. Perhaps he would as well.

And frustration is purely rational, born in the conflict of what he thinks should be and what truly is. Shadows are his realm, and his alone--excepting NightStar. What power or right has the phantom to challenge him there? What does it matter? It can as it will. It will as it can. And if he's forced to fight against his own powers, his own realm, and if it makes him scared and if it makes him angry, then to the phantom, it's a job well done. Of course it will oppose him--it can't be but otherwise. And of course it will frustrate him as much as it can, until the battle is done. And **that** is justice--conflict across the line, from every breath to every thought. Until the end. And that bit of justice he understood.

His eyes opened and they pointed still to where he imagined the other to be. "I am scared," he told it. "I am angry. And I am frustrated. But like you I will fight this battle as I can. So come as you will, when you will. I am ready."

Nothing responded, and he found that he almost had to add disappointment to his little list. The images he'd set aside tickled at his mind, and he brought them forth. Dispassionately, he reviewed them, chopping them apart into images and symbolism. His focused mind pried at the bits, pushing and prodding them to see if there was anything in his memories that matched.

The last, perhaps, was the chorus he'd imagined, of souls laughing at him. But the first... A whirlwind of shadow blades he could not accomplish. Maintaining anything as fine as a cutting edge was more difficult the further away from himself he projected it. Swirling blades... not his own then. Or was it a future memory? Or a past unremembered act? Warning or history? Or someone else's power? NightStar's? Could even _she_ manage that?

The memory leaves a ripple of troubled thoughts--but only a ripple. He would examine it further later. Now, he had things to do.

His cloak and glove slip on with practived smoothness. He finds and pockets a cheap, disposable cell phone and its associated battery. A rustle of shadow sweeps the room, extinguishing the candles, all save one. And from it's light, through it's shadow, he steps.

DarkGlow recieves the call back in record timing. That same sweet voice croons across the phonelines. "Yesss?"

"For the moment he's calm enough to merely smile as the cool shiver crawls up his spine. "Hello, again. I trust you've been well." _Though if others around her have faired poorly, that's quite another matter--and one should not pry._ "You recall my previous request concerning the some... events surrounding Dew Chemical?" There's little point to the question, but it's best to stay polite.

"Yes, I do. I looked into it when you mentioned. Not the work of anyone _I_ knew. And you have a follow up question," She concludes. From the sound of it, she all ready knows the answer, but why give anything away?

DarkGlow says, "The... debt was satisfactorily settled and had nothing to do with the events in question. However, I'm afraid that certain related parties are becoming a touch paranoid. As much as I like earning--or taking--money, I dislike the thought of acting as... security. Unless, of course, there's nothing to the paranoia in which case I'd be happy to take the assignment. Anyway, the rumour has it that Mr. Bell, Mr. Burnson and Mr. Carter have acquired people who disapprove of their... living, and that one of our merry band has been asked to look into the matter."

"Mmmm. Well, you know, don't quote me on this because the transaction didn't run through me, but... Well, let's just say that someone's new in town. They arrived last night. Not exactly sure how to pronounce the name in it's native tongue, but translated, the individual is Death's Patient Kiss."

DarkGlow nods slowly to himself. _Pronoun game, even. Lovely._ "I see. With a name like that, I'm certain it would be amusing to meet the person over a drink at a party--and less so over crossed weaponry. I guess I shall have to assure my fellow that the world isn't out to get him and that he really has no need of my services. A shame, since I'll have no money from the job and yet I still must pay research expenses. Though if you do hear any more about this player, please let me know. That's quite the name, and I'm interested--if not exactly dying--to meet its holder."

"Oh, I do believe they may be coming across certain individuals associated with you. Don't get your hopes up. I can't tug my strings and find out the when and where, but... call it woman's intuition, that you might want to watch your back. But you know what they say. Watch your back, and death comes from the front."
