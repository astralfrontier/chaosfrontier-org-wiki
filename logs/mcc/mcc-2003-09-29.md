The Island. Once more, situated in the middle of the Detroit river, the crickets singing, the wind whipping at weeds. This time, though, DarkGlow ends up in the woods, just along the edge. And past the immediate shock of being here, something is very, very different. There are men on the island, pulling up in a speedboat.

Heart thudding in chest, DarkGlow berates himself to be calm--not that furious internal exhortations can be quick at achieving such a purpose. _Calmly... quietly... Damn it, calm down! No, no... take it easy. I can handle this. And if my heart's fit to burst, in the end what does it matter?_ He eyes the speedboat and its occupants. _Have I been pulled into a trap, to be taken care of by men when perhaps my phantom friend cannot? Calmly now... If that were the case, I shouldn't be able to slip out of here, right? So... can I?_ Calmly as he can, he carefully feels for shadow, as if he was preparing to step through...

There is shadow everywhere, all around. The moon is at its weakest in the cycle, letting only starlight flit down upon the waters. The men file out of their boat, and from here he can't tell much about them. They do not seem to be looking at him directly, instead just looking around and standing patiently by the shore. However, the faint sound of their conversation reaches the hidden man's ears, and one thing is clear: it's an asian tongue.

DarkGlow's eyes narrow. _Y'know, I neglected to ask if the real name of "Death's Patient Kiss" was Asian--unpronounceable or no. Damn._ He cloaks and shields himself in shadow and moves closer, quiet as he can. Upon reflection he triggers one of the bugs he caries--audio this time. He probably won't catch much, but you never know.

They mull around the shore, talking, and it appears they are nervous and anxious. "Gentlemen!" Heads turn towards the voice coming from the woods. A man in a black wetsuit walks towards them, a box in hand. His features are unrecognizable, behind the mask, but his mouth is bare, as is the bushy, dense dark beard. "Good evening," one of the asians reply, walking forward. "Is that what it is we want?" "Indeedy do. Captain Blackbeard delivers."

DarkGlow creeps closer. _English. Well at least I'll no longer have to wonder if there's any point to spying on them..._ DarkGlow thinks, with some relief. A glance over his shoulder at the treeline. _What the hell are you playing at? Err... and I mean that in a kind and gentle and_ calm _way..._ Not expecting an answer, he returns his attention to the men. _Now, how badly do I want to see what's in box number one?_

"Very good," Replies the speaker for the speedboaters. The other three look like general toughs. Looking behind 'BlackBeard', DG can take note of hints of others in the trees, atleast one. "And you be getting what you requested soon enough." "Pleasure doing business with you. You need anything else, just leave a calling card." The asians dispurse, climbing back into their boat, while Blackbeard stands on the shore.

DarkGlow frowns as the Asians climb aboard. _Four plus is a few too many. Easier, I think just to ask the supplier._ His eyes scan the treeline intently. _But how many friends does he actually have?_ With a slight wince, he prepares to teleport to the treeline, well ahead of Blackbeard.

DarkGlow moves to the forest, and spots two others after atleast half a minute of scanning. One holding what looks like a sniper rifle ten years from now, the other a woman holding a nasty looking pistol that probably doesn't sling lead. They blend into the background well enough to not be noticed if you walked by, and sit deadstill. While wearing wetsuits, it's obvious they are not small time hoodlums.

DarkGlow's lips are set in a thin line when he finally spots the pair. A glance at Blackbeard shows him to be practically on top of them. _Crap._ He memorizes an exit shadow a few hundred metres away, crouches invisibly against a tree and whips shadow through the darkness at the rifleman. It encloses the man tightly. _Be quiet. Don't move, don't make a sound..._ At the moment, not even DarkGlow could tell if he was referring to himself or the sniper.

The sniper shifts side to side, and then tilts his barrel just so. Three rounds hiss silenced into the night, peppering the ground at Blackbeard's feet. The captain's gun is in his hand, all ready moving in a sweeping step into the threeline. The woman rolls backwards from her position poised behind a tree, backwards to come up, gun poised, a quick scan of the treeline while her weapon is held at ready aim for anything.

_I think I'll tap her on the shoulder. That should get her attention..._ Shadows writhe behind the woman, before lashing out like an umbra cobra. It strikes her right between the shoulders, sending her pitching forward, face first into a rock. But before she went down, a shot squeezes off. A small starburst of light that whizzes over the snipers head, drilling a hole almost completely through the trunk of a tree.

Blackbeard is no where in immediate sight.

DarkGlow probes the darkness with his eyes, listens for any sound reaching his eardrums, and touches every shadow in the trees with his mind. _Bloody hell..._ A glance at the woman confirms she isn't moving. _Bit harder than I thought. Guess she won't be whirling, wondering what's behind her..._ Wrapped in shadow like armour, he waits. _Should take the guns away from them... but where the hell is the other one?_

He can sense the shadow of Blackbeard, several yards off.

_Something... what's that?_ The shadow feels familiar in his mind... _Like a man--or close enough. Hello, pleased to meet you. Say, have you hugged your shadow recently?_ Blackbeard's shadow pools, merges with others nearby. _It's lonely--give it a hug..._ Silently, invisibly against the wetsuit, the shadow oozes up, coating him. And then-- it tightens like steel. _If you treated your shadow better, things like this wouldn't happen, you know,_ DarkGlow silently admonishes him. _But the other two--_now _they get disarmed._

After entangling the woman in shadow as well--just to be careful-- DarkGlow plucks the weapons from his late opponents and buries them a few metres away from him towards the water. _Guess digging here with skullface was practice for this..._ Once the others are rendered safe--or at least moderately so--DarkGlow finally approaches the pirate-named man. A bare metre in front of him, he steps out from the shadows and regards the man. "You know, in an odd way, I'm jealous of that beard. Mine simply won't come in like that."

Blackbeard peers around the three, the rest of his body concealed by it. "That so? If I were able to move my hands, I'd stroke it, you know. But it's a little hard. Nice to know I'm revered, atleast. So, out on a lark or is there a purpose to netting me like a fish?"

DarkGlow nods. "Well," he starts cheerily, "for starters I haven't the foggiest idea who you people are or where you came from or why you're carrying guns that can burns holes in trees. And, consequently, I really don't care about you one whit. Fortunately for you. Hell, if I didn't have this gruesome image of what one of those bolts could do to my carefully laundered and pressed cloak, I'd probably even apologize to your lady friend for hitting her." The cheerful tone drops an octave. "On the other hand, I really don't care about you one whit. _Unfortuantely_ for you. Look around this island--there's a fair amount of land and a, excuse me, boatload of water surrounding it. And the nastiest thing I'm going to say is that I'm not afraid to use it."

The news doesn't seem to take Blackbeard by surprise, nor does it faze him any. "Fair enough. So. You've went on about what you don't care about, so there has to be something you do want. And as much as I would like to hang around here and flap my gums, we're expected back soon. Else there'll be suspicion and others to come find us. So what can I do you for?"

"Fair enough," DarkGlow answers back. "I don't really like threats. I'm not very good at them, so people don't believe me, and then I have to do something messy. I like this way much better." He jerks a chin toward the water. "Your customers weren't as... observant as they might have been on the way here. If I were you, I'd charge them extra next time. We want to discourage them from causing such annoyances as this in the future, right?" He shrugs eloquently. "So, as you might guess, it's them I'm interested in. They just left with a nicely mysterious box. Now, I can have my compatriots stop them when they get to shore and open it up--but I think that would ruin the surprise, don't you agree? I think everyone would be much happier--for now, anyway--if I knew what was in the box without having to open it up. What do you think?"

Blackbeard mmhms. "Pretty much, that'd make everyone's lives easier. All right, Mr Mystery, imagine for yourself an explosive material able to level a city block. Or, if used in smaller quantities, so hot that it reduces anything in the incendiary blast to ash. Or various other things. Pretty much, it is utterly illegal, and some of the hardest explosive material to come across on this continent." A light smile. "And they bought it. So, do you feel better knowing? And, ah, if your associates get them when they get to shore, well, we didn't have this talk, right?"

DarkGlow taps a finger to his lips. "What talk? This is just a pleasant business converstaion regarding materials I might be interested in acquiring from an obviously well-stocked supplier. Do you have a number or website or something where I can reach you? I believe your catalogue would make some facinating reading." _Crap, crap, crap... What associates on shore? I've really gotta go..._

A shrug - as best that he can do - from the captain. "Well, we generally avoid contact. So a nice meeting is generally what we do, like here. We don't trust anyone, and seeing what you did to us, I'm sure you can see the reason for that. So, tell you what. We'll leave a message over there," A jerk of his chin towards the burnt out house, "And you can pick it up eventually, it'll have a date, time and place."

DarkGlow nods again, completely agreeable. "And an invoice, if you please. I think I shall be helping myself to your lady friend's weapon. Call me odd, but I believe in paying for sample merchandise." The gun snakes out of the darkness, bourne by a coil of a shadow. It's slipped quickly into a pocket. He steps backwards, begins to fade. "Oh, yes," he says, as if remembering suddenly. "Your bonds should dissolve shortly. Lovely night out, though. Enjoy it. You never know what will happen tomorrow, eh?" He fades completely and steps through shadow, reappearing elsewhere in an isolated spot. He claws for his radio, in pure contradiction to his clam tones moments earlier. While flipping it on and adjusting the settings, he ponders briefly, _Should've killed them. Easier in the long run. But plucking a weed and leaving the root doesn't work, and spilling blood in some meeting some phantom set up and when some phantom might be watching doesn't seem too healthy._ Raising the radio to his lips, he begins speaking.
