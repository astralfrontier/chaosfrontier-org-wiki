In the early morning hours, those travelling to their places of work in Millennium City Chinatown might note the signs that have been placed at strategic points around the community. Always they are shadowed or placed at angles not designed to catch the eye of incurious passers-by, but will be visible enough to those who live and work in the community. To further obscure their meaning from the Western shoppers of the district and casual police inspection, they are printed in Cantonese, and read: The Chinese Fighting Tong Are Not Fit To Clean Toilets. At Sunset On The Island Of Ghosts, They Will Be Humiliated.

Even while the signs are still being observed, Thomas is busy. At the moment he's huddled behind a dumpster in a back alley, his hands waving over a cache of guns and ammunition. A small change to the structure of the weapons, really - a slight but significant alteration in the barrel's interior. When each gun is fired, the round will travel perhaps an inch and a half - and stop. The vigilante chuckles inwardly as he works, rendering each weapon a potentially lethal death-trap to whomever fires it.

By midday, when the news of the posters is making its way through the smokey underworld of Chinatown, Thomas is busy working with a small improvised laboratory of chemicals, carefully brewing a noxious concoction with which to immobilize perhaps two dozen people.

Next up is a series of taps to intercept cellular phone transmissions, which Tom works out carefully using a borrowed phone for testing purposes. Beside him on a work-table is a careful blueprint of Peche Island as he remembers it, with certain spots marked.

Sunset comes. And with it, several powerboats coming from the river. They look loaded with very hard faced Chinese, who scan the shoreline with glares. They do not land at the same place, a few dozen meters apart, one landing in the woods.

Thomas slips carefully away from his hiding place, leaving the binoculars behind, and takes a deep breath as he leaps into the dark and forbidding Earth. He 'swims' thus toward the island, positioning himself beneath the center-point for his project, and uses his powers of sound to resonate a challenging voice in Cantonese: "Come and be humiliated, dogs." With that done, he speeds under the soil towards the distant cabin, surfacing inside it once he's satisfied that it's unoccupied, for a much-needed breath of air.

The men are there. And they are obviously angry, but they are not stupid. Barely a whisper of their feet moving across the ground, but they have fanned out. None hide openly, and not everyone is using the cached weapons that is recognized. Some have more military looking machineguns.

Thomas again submerges, diving into the soil and stone beneath the island, cruising to the center point once again. He uses his powers to expand the soil outward, giving him room to work in, for what comes next will demand concentration enough without the need for keeping himself immaterial.

Out of the ground rises the Ghost Knight, contemptuous and defiant of the Tongs on the island. The black and forbidding figure crosses its arms, standing on the sand and waiting patiently.

Within the earthy womb, hidden in a partially formed cave beneath the surface, Tom waits, and spares enough power to draw sound to him. And what he hears is an eruption of gunfire. Some other noted explosions, which earn a few screams or surprised shouts. Through the telekinetic line, he can feel the suit get hit numerous times, and bullets by the dozen are pooling at the suit's feet.

The Ghost crumples to the sand, falling like a dead man ought to, apparently gunned down mercilessly by the Tongs.

The triumphant shoulds are heard, but they immediately are cut off, as the arc of perception catches a few coming closer. A gun goes off, shooting a few more times, before more start moving in, the circle growing tighter, even though the few are moving in to ensure the many.

As the men move closer, Thomas shifts the ground around him, and the soil of the isle parts, baring balloons of innocent nature. With help of the powered kind,t hey partially float up, before bursting. A great cloud sweeps the air, sending some reeling, others falling, and a few backing away. But most are caught fully in the cloud of noxious gas.

The ground beneath the dead Ghost heaves and sags, and the body falls partially into the gap. Then a few moments later the fully restored Ghost Knight rises effortlessly to its feet, stepping out of the hole. **Guns don't work on me. Perhaps you'd like to try kung-fu?** his resonant voice suggests, mocking and hollow, as the cloud of gas spreads rapidly away from his body, urged on by Tom's power.

Only three men remain in the aftermath of the gas. One can only squeeze off a small hail of gunfire that the Ghost avoids, while the second only stands there with a look of indecision. The third, however, screams in defiance, and charges towards the Ghostknight. Before he reaches him, one of the large machineguns is taken up in his hand, and like a staff he swings for the Ghost's skull.

The island itself seems to scream as a battle-cry rents the air, the wordless fury of the Ghost. His arms stretch out, and like lightning, a pair of handguns spring from the sand where they lie, through the air, and into the gloved hands of the undead stalker. They converge forward as he draws a bead on his would-be assailant. **DROP. IT. NOW.**

Hon Ki-Leu is a loyal Tong. In the face of adversity, in the face of the Dead Dragon, he attacked where his others had not. If he was not honorable, loyal to the Tongs, he would surely die. However, the display renders him momentarily stunned, and he staggers back a second, the gun dropped from his hands on reflex. He nearly scoops it up again, but it tumbles out of his grasp, and still he stands his ground against the Dead Dragon. Behind him, both men have dropped their guns.

Thomas chucks both guns behind him as well, the skull widening into a grin. **Now. Fight me.** And he drops into a pose, the low and confident Wing Chun style flowing naturally through his muscles.

With the pronouncement, the man who took up the gun against the Ghost Knight was momentarily taken aback. Then he cries out, "As Tongs, assist me!" in Cantonese, and doesn't take his eyes off of the Ghost Knight. The others move towards him, the first hesitant, the latter at a crawl, but he follows none the less. The loyal Tong jumps at the Ghost Knight, dropping to the ground to sweep at legs. However, the Knight hops over them, and kicks the sweeper to the ground, while a punch comes his way from the rushing Tong.

Thomas whirls on the sand, ducking and wrapping his grasp swiftly around the incoming fist. He leans, effortlessly tossing his second attacker to the ground beside the first, finishing the spin in the Sun stance and awaiting the third, should he choose to approach.

A mere stance is taken by the third, and he looks as though he would prefer to be elsewhere, but still he does not back down, most likely fearing the Tong more then the Knight.

Thomas acrobatically leaps forward, planting himself on his hands and somersaulting over the downed bodies of the two Tong enforcers, landing in a crouch just before the third. Despite the man's best efforts to be out of the way at the quick-as-lightning vigilante, Tom's foot swings under his own and he, too, lands hard in the sand with his companions.

Thomas vaults to his feet, pausing to give the downed thug a brief kick on the way. He regains his stance, even as the three men recover from their knockdown. The Ghost is confident, smug, but not yet assured of victory. And as he guides his body into super-human motions with his powers of telekinesis, a small sliver of doubt remains firmly embedded in Tom's own mind.

The first two Tongs stand upwards, and spread outward, not going to make it easy to attack them both at the same time, while they move towards the Knight. The third stands up, and backpedals a small bit, favoring one leg. Then glancing at his fellows who spare a "Fight or die," he darts forwards and offers a firm kick towards the Knight's midsection.

Thomas sidesteps neatly, still confident in his defensive stance. **It is no dishonor to be defeated by me,** he says, calmly enough, in that chilling voice.

Some of Tom's confidence drains away when he darts low, swinging his foot in a vicious sweep. The first Tong isn't fast enough to evade it, but the second has seen this trick used a few seconds before.

The second man may have been wary of attacks below the knees, but he's unprepared when Tom flips over, facing the sand and planting his gloved hands into the soil of the island, his legs spiralling quickly to smack the two remaining standing men, knocking them over to join their companion.

The first Tong, as the Ghost Knight does his hand standing assault, pushes forwards to fall onto the back of his hands, kicking forwards with both feet at the Ghost Knight's back. It does no good, but he uprights himself, taking a stance. The other two fall, but one attempts to kick the knight while down, while the other leaps to his feet attempting to strike, but all of the attempst are unyielding.

Thomas feels the impacts and laughs, his deep and dead voice booming across the island. **You're mine,** he scowls, again adopting his accustomed stance, strong and ready.

Thomas turns and smashes his gloved fists into the solar plexus and jaw of the third Tong, knocking the man backwards by a considerable distance to land unconscious.

Thomas easily sidesteps the first attempt at a kick. His head tilts just to the left, a contemptuous gesture indeed, as the second man throws a punch at his face.

The punch left the second Tong over extended, and without recourse, the Knight clamps hands on the mobster's shoulders. A single, quick step back, before the Tong is yanked forwards and down, onto the onrushing knee as the Knight jumps upwards. Plated knee and chest meet in a very messy collision, flattening him on his back, as well as the lungs in his chest.

Thomas gestures to the two downed men with a gloved hand. **Take them away and tell your masters of your defeat,** he commands. **Unless of course, you'd like to try something else?**

The final, remaining Tong is the one who had first attacked the Knight face on. Ironic, that he is the only one who is standing, his fellows unconcious or sucking in the wind that had been knocked from them. He instead backs up, standing his ground, and waits. "I am to take them all?" He asks, voice restrained, not needing to look at all the unconcious men to acknowledge them.

**Those two,** says the Ghost, pointing at the two unconscious fighters. **The rest... are mine. If any survive what is to come, I'm sure they will make their way back on their own.**

The Tong can only look from the Knight to the other Tongs, frowning. But he does as is told, as he starts dragging the third man towards the boat to throw him on. By this time the second has his wind in him, and this one helps the man to the boat. Soon they are driving off through the water.

A few minutes later, as the fireballs of gasoline marine engines can be heard from the beach, the Ghost is walking along the sand, as the tide comes in. _Phones - tapped,_ he thinks to himself, rattling off a checklist. _Tongs - humiliated. They'll need a ride off the island somehow. I wonder who they'll call?_ And with that thought in mind, he dives forward, disappearing from sight into the damp sand and swimming through the earth below on his way back to the warehouse.

Tom barely makes it home before the tapped phones begin squaking. A phone turns on, and there is much yelling in the background. The first conversation begins in Cantonise. "Well?" "We have been disgraced." "What!" "The Dead Dragon, the. .. Ghost Knight was here, and he caused us all to pass out." "How!" "I do not k now. There are balloons..." "You are an idiot. Put on Hei Kwan."

"Sir?" "Tell me what happened." There is a quick, brief summery. "This is unacc eptable." "I am shamed, Hao." "You are not humoring." "How must we make amends? " "Meo will not be happy. He will want someone's head." "There are some missing -" "Find them." "We need to get off the is-" "Swim." "But-" "I must gain the ho nor to us you have destroyed."

"What about the dead?" "Explain how they died." "... their weapons exploded." " Very well, I will send one boat. It will be to pick up the bodies. It will fit three others. You decide among yourselves who will swim." "What will be done to regain our honor?" "You have none. But we will deal with him. He will deal wit h the three." "Can they deal with him?" "If not, then they have disgraced us on ce too many, and will be delt with. Let this be a challange for them to wipe th eir shame."
