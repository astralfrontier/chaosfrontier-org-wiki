# Millennium City Chronicles 2003-10-20

Monday morning, behind the Memorial Park Police Station sits an armored car. The motor is running, a man sits in the driver's seat, drumming his fingers, looking impatient. The armored car is parked right against a normal door, waiting for the cargo to be put in. The cargo, known to all but the police and others waiting, are the three Dew Chemical board members who have confessed to a variety of crimes. Positioned in strategic places along the road are the Champions, and their unannounced allies. Both ends of the street have a partial roadblock in preperation.

The Ghost is crouched, clinging to the wall between two buildings nearby, using the shadows to mask his presence from the air and his altitude to go unnoticed by those who may be patrolling the ground. His senses are alert to the surroundings, and his radio is in constant use, relaying to him the traffic passing between the units of law-enforcement gathered here.

DarkGlow looks on the proceedings from high in the air, leaning on a roof's brick ledge overlooking the area, a bored feeling permeating him. A tendril of temptation intrudes suggesting that he dislodge skullface from his shadow drenched perch, but even that fails to really stir any interest. His eyes flick from one end of the street to the other. _Patience is a virtue. Pity its so tightly coupled with boredom..._ About the only thing worrying him is that package that got away--even with a handful of shadows memorized various distances away, DarkGlow seriously doubts he could outrun an explosion through one of them. _Why am I here again? I'm having trouble remembering..._

"Ghost Knight." Defender's voice comes over the radio. "You know the plan, right?" The man sounds anxious; they had detailed the plan beforehand. Worrying that there may be more the one assassin, or group for that matter, the two heroic teams had decided for a singular line of defense: The Champions take care of the biggest threats, and their shadowy associates hold back in case something else may come in.

**We know the plan,** responds Tom. He personally intends to stick to the trio of defendants like glue, doing whatever is necessary to ensure their survival. _If I can pull this off,_ he thinks to himself, _it means everything I've done has been for a good purpose... living in this underworld really will have proved itself effective._

DarkGlow pulls a face at his radio. _Plan? Risking getting blown to bits for a bunch of decoys isn't much of a plan. Stay away from Champions and don't get killed--that's a plan I can, with luck, live with._

Ten long, long minutes pass. GK's senses pierce the walls across the building; the room linked to the armored car has a small cluster of armed police, waiting. However, the knight makes note that there's someone moving along the side of the building, towards the armored car. However, from his angle he couldn't see that side.

Thomas relays the news to Defender, via radio, obediently hanging back.

"This is odd," It comes over the radio, "There's no one there."

**Then they are invisible,** retorts the Ghost, wishing he could afford to sound a little miffed.

Ghost Knight's senses pick up an aura speeding fast towards the roadblock. Shouts come from down the street, split-second warning what looks like a golden comet blazing down the street. It broadsides the armored car, squealing tires and the armored car sways, nearly falling over. A dent consumes the side, charred and ugly. Standing beside it is a figure, a man of broad shoulders who's form ripples with golden energy.

**Your target has arrived. We will deal with the unseen,** suggests GK, detaching himself from the wall and beginning to leap through the building at high speed, approaching his quarry.

The policemen holled up in the side of the police building unleash a hail of gunfire into the glowing figure. He laughs, blossoming dots eruping as they get too close to his form. "Ha! Stupid pigs." He starts approaching the cops' place, "Now where are-" Words are cut short as bolts of brilliant blue hit him broadside and send him skidding down the street.

DarkGlow watches the glowball dimwit with amusement for a moment, then decides that participating is more fun than voyeurism. _GhostKnight said there was someone... around where that shadow is. Let's pay a visit--and hope he's not_ too _'unseen'._

The aura has moved into the policemen's niche, merging with the clustered groups.

Through the wall the vigilante leaps, landing in a low crouch a few feet away from the huddled knot of policemen waiting at the back door. His senses extend themselves to their fullest as his eyes dart hither and yon, seeking the discrepancy.

DarkGlow's eyes focus on the armoured car ahead of him, and see nothing in the intervening space. _Assuming that where the guy is heading of course. This wouldn't work with NightStar, but what the hell..._ Shadow gathers rapidly at his command, and he sends it out in a broad fan of feelers, like a splash of dark liquid racing to cover the ground. He tries feeling for where the thin webs don't reach, blocked by an invisible body.

Shadow detection gets the idea: right in front of the block. The police at the back door have riot gear set up; shields, helmets and guns prepped to be assaulted by the streaking ball of power that is now quipping and causing undo destruction across the street. The prepped wall of men flench, an explosion of movement out of thin air: blurred form kicking off one of the shields to start arching over it.

Thomas reaches through the floor, coming up with both hands filled with the raw material of the building's superstructure, weapons shaping themselves at his silent command even as he swings at the invisible being whose space he can nevertheless sense.

The strike lands solid, sending the invisible assassin rolling through the air, skidding across the ground. "Holy shit!" Declares one of the cops. "Bar the door, bar the door!"

Ghost Knight moves quickly to where the unseen assailant is, sending a kick towards the glowing form. His eyes catches the blur, before it sweeps downwards, lashing out in a spin across the back of his legs.

Lips quirking upward, DarkGlow feels the discontinuity where the attacker should be. _And what did the spider say to the fly, anyway?_ The web collapses, shadows from where the assailant is not rushing to where the assailant is.

Thomas spins off the ground, breaking for a moment the laws of gravity and inertia to propel his body into another rapid pair of strikes against the unseen and the unknown. At least the laws of kinetic damage remain intact, for he feels the satisfying vibration of impact shiver its way through his twin weapons.

The shadows cling to the invisible perpetrater, leaving them an open target for the Knight's weapons.

DarkGlow blinks as GhostKnight smashes the invisible attacker again through his entangling shadows. With a mental shrug, he twists shadows together and lashes at the newly still figure as well. _When in Rome-- Err... when with good guys, do what they do, I guess..._

The shadows lash out in a vicious whipcord, smacking the bound assailant into the wall. However, the movement doesn't stop there. They dip down, close to the ground, and as the shadows part like wheat before the scythe, the blurred figure leaps from the ground, to roll over the top of the police building.

Appearing on the scene like he had always been there, Guy shows up. Maybe he had always been there. "So let's see... where're the uhhh... er... wait was that?"

Thomas vaults into the air effortlessly, defying gravity and his erstwhile adversary as well as he gives chase across the rooftop, maces out and ready to do their worst.

DarkGlow stares upwards in extreme annoyance as the shadows slither back to their original locations. _Fine, then. Don't surrender gracefully. See if I care._ Concentrating, he finds skullface's shadow and teleports to it. _He seems to know where Mr. Invisio is. Hope he doesn't mind this too much--or startle easily..._

The streaking blur can be spotted running towards the other side of the roof. The sounds of the Champions' battle wages on, but Ghost Knight's senses pick up something else; a speeding van hauling towards the armored car. It stops, as people jump out. Angry chinese voices are heard, among all of them, "The door is locked!"

Thomas curses and wheels. **DarkGlow, Guy, Tongs below. The unseen is a decoy. Down!**

The street below is a battlefield. Beyond, beams and energy comb the ground. The back of the armored car is thrown open, two chinese men with machine guns stand in front of the open doors. One is trying to yank open the door. They all look young, teenage or barely legal.

Out of nowhere, the Ghost leaps frmo the rooftop again, maces whirling as he knocks down one, two, three men, using his improvised weapons as levers against knees and necks.

Guy watches the Blur escape. He smirks, as is his wont. _Oh? Well..._ Guy holds out a hand, shifting time a bit so that the escaping blur isn't quite so fast anymore... movements, if they could be seen, would be more sluggish. "You can run... but... well actually you can't run."

DarkGlow grimaces in skullface's direction as he disappears over the edge of the building, leaving him in a fairly bare expance of rooftop. _Gee, thanks. I'll just walk, then, shall I?_ Instead of walking, DarkGlow sprints to the edge of the roof. Wishing he was close enough for a more personal touch, he again gathers the shadow from below and flings it at a pair of goons still standing, forcing them together violently. _You guys were already friendly, right?_

Power flows, shadows surge and cup the individuals, slamming them together. One falls to the side, momentarily stunned, the second doesn't look too phased.

Rising from striking the three thugs, the Knight crosses to the thug ready by the van, his weapon prepped. One mace lashes out, knocking the machine gun out of the Tong's hands. The second mace is dropped, caught and crumpled to fall in parts at his feet.

The Tong falls backwards, and has to hold his hands up, stumbling backwards away from the Knight.

DarkGlow frowns at the thug left standing after his little impromtu meeting of the minds--well, skulls anyway. _Minds isn't quite as certain. Stick around, would you, and I guess we'll find out._ Shadows flow over his target like viscous oil, immobilizing him.

Up above, the blur is slowed considerably, but by the time the thugs are done the assailant is at the edge of the building. And then they are in the air, falling down out of view.

Over the river and through the woods - or in this case, through the rivets and wood and under the roof - flies the Ghost, flashing through solid material and open air with casual disdain as he barrels through the police station in pursuit of the invisible assassin. Out of the front he emerges, diving into the street and streaking under the road after his quarry.

DarkGlow casts a critical eye down below for a second. Satisfied that no one presents a threat, he turns away. _Hope the cops will take the lack of noise--other than the groaning--as a sign they can stop cowering and make some arrests. Meanwhile, there's someone needing a lesson in staying beaten..._ Concentrating, he moves through shadow to the alley below the far side of the building, spotting the blurred form on the roof of a car immediately. _Hello, again. Let's try this again, shall we?_ Shadow again flies at the assailant.

The car is going too fast, or DarkGlow misjudged the speed, for the shadows hit the back end of the car and end up gripping trunk.

The black form emerges like a bat from the roadway, flinging itself through the air and landing with jarring weight on the trunk. As the Ghost grins, one hand planted on the hot metal of the car's back-end, the vehicle itself begins to lift itself off the street and into the air.

DarkGlow sends a mental 'thank-you' to GhostKnight for stopping the car--but then the form vanishes completely. _Gotta be there_ somewhere_..._ Semi-blindly, he whips shadow at anything that happens to be still standing on the car's roof, and grins as he feels the shock of contact.

The car is swept clean, and the occupant on the roof goes sailing, from what the GHost Knight can precieve. And rolling, off into the parking lot beside the road.

Thomas releases the car gently, settling it down onto the road to let an apprehensive family continue its journey, and leaps lightly off it, landing in the nearby parking lot and striding confidently toward where he feels the invisible man. **Surrender,** his voice says, resonant and deep, and Tom puts every bit of his force into crafting as commanding a tone as he can.

The aura is low to the ground, and from what the Knight can tell, hasn't moved yet. "I am not going to jail," is the meager, if not desperate reply from the assassin, one of chinese accent, and female.

**You cannot escape us,** replies GK firmly. **Who do you work for?**

Silence, for many moments, before, "A Mr Chen requested my assistance."

GK nods, once. **Stay where you are. If you attempt to flee, I will ensure that you are imprisoned and forced to talk by the authorities. If you remain, we may... arrange something.**

During the exchange, DarkGlow steps invisibly from a shadow on the far side of the parking lot. _It could end peaceably, I suppose._ Shadows swirl around him gently. _But I'm not holding my breath._

The Ghost Knight recieves no further reply, even if he is aware she hasn't went anywhere.

Thomas gets on the radio with Defender, briefly explaining the circumstances of the capture, maintaining a wall of silence so that his captive will not grow unduly suspicious.
