# Millennium City Chronicles 2003-10-27

Defender's suit jets cool as iron feet touch down on the pavement. According to them, they won, but he looks pretty worse for wear; dings and scratches, one piece of the arm almost coming off, not to mention burns and fused parts of the metal. He scans around. "So, where are they?"

The assailant steps out from behind a van. Metallic green and unreflective black reinforce a suit made not to bulk. The eyes appear multi-faceted, or more a trick of the light, while what are likely hooked blades are attached beneath the wrists. She simply nods. Defender walks over, taking ahold of her arm, while nodding to Ghost Knight. Only to the Ghost Knight's awareness, however, something starts to beep.

Thomas curses to himself. Too much to do, too much... **You need not go to jail. You can provide a valuable service as informant to the Champions. Evidence of your death - irrefutable evidence, I might add - can be supplied. You will not be traced or pursued. Decide now.**

"Glad t'know everyone turned out alright. And no one looks too much the worse for wear." Guy rambles a bit, still kinda stunned when he shows back up. He peers at the suited girl, "Ah Ms. Inviso, I presume. What he said."

Guy gestures towards Ghost Knight, for clarity.

The woman simply nods. "I will go with what you say." "Ghost Knight, I'll let you guys handle what the police say about the guys with the guns who pulled up. If they turn up anything, it would probably be more useful to you."

The skull nods in assent. **Let's get out of sight for now. I will require water and some chemicals.** Privately, Tom curses, thinking ahead to the hard challenge he's set himself to, and thinking about what it will take to track down the airport alert after that...

DarkGlow steps out silently from the shadows lining the parking lot's border. Visible for once, his arms arms folded across his chest, he appears a grim figure cloaked in black. His sardonic thoughts and twisted lips do nothing to detract from this image, thankfully hidden inside his skull and hood respectively. _Well, this was mildly entertaining. So, do I know anyplace 'round here for a quick snack? Oh, wait..._ "I do note there didn't seem to be any large explosions. I don't suppose any would-be bombers were captured?"

Thomas turns to his teammate. **We may have a chance to capture one. One of my alarms was triggered. But this must come first. We cannot be everywhere.**

Guy gives a glance to DG, then to GK. "Alright... so what do we do then? I mean, we could probably split up and go to the airport if need be... otherwise..."

DarkGlow nods solemnly, whilst simultaneously blinking rapidly and swallowing, actions cloaked by shadow. _Talking to a Champion.. What the devil are you playing at? Leaving is a real good idea..._

The Ghost Knight goes to work. The body is made up of standard compounds and chemicals, with a specific structure and appearances. The body of their attacker is documented by police, announced in a report and to the media - though no names are named. The three head toward the airport once more, on yet another potential wild goose chase. This time, the vigilante's tracking device is moving steadily: a VW bug puttering along the road towards the city contains their mystery package.

The Bug, interestingly enough, goes straight to Millennium City University. It parks, and out steps a square man in his forties, dressed in an oxford, tie, brown slacks, and a hawaiian shirt. Having previously searched the vehicle via his perceptions, the Knight knows it is the odd device that was in the locker.

The man walks across campus, and shadowed by the curious vigilantes, heads for the math and engineering building. Up the stairs, calling in a jovial English tilt towards everyone who says hello, before pushing into an office marked Ernest P. Blake.

The tiny weight of his cell phone in his pocket is enough to make DarkGlow wonder if he's about to be told off again, but even so he moves from a convenient shadow outside the office into a similar shadow within. Invisibly he looks about.

Thomas has not yet abandoned stealth, and now he creeps through the steel and mortar bones of the building, listening in on the conversation above...

Guy is striding casually through the halls, keeping to himself. His brand of stealth isn't one of not being seen, but rather one of not being overly obtrusive, blending in where he can. He is decidedly not as noteworthy in a crowd as the other two.

Books thrown about the office in haphazard piles, bits of rock and little nicknacks sit on shelves - those that would move in odd little patterns from the simple touch. Ernest drops down into his chair, opening his bag, and extracts the device, which looks like a fancy brick. "There you are... I missed you far too long." He reaches over to the phone on the desk, and punches in a number. "Hello, Arnold, yes I'm back good as new. Yes, a bouncing baby boy. Cute as his father. Yes, that tiresomeon the eyes. Yes! It's here. I know, leaving it in that locker was risky, but I didn't want anyone to look too closely for it and I couldn't take it with me; you know these anti-terrorist laws and all. They'd be afraid I'd suck the plane into a black hole or something."

_Well,_ that wasn't a conversation I was expecting to hear, DarkGlow thinks. _Now the man's actually got me curious. Fortunately for him, that's a lot safer these days than, say, last month..._

"I'll be taking it home tonight, no worries. And then you can play with it first thing in the morning! No, I will not leave it with you; I won't let it out of my sight. Speaking of which, I have to go. Things to do, things to do. Bright fresh at seven o'clock Arnold. Toodles." Hanging up the phone, he releases a sigh. "That man is insufferable." Taking a bottle of clear liquid from his desk, he uncorks. From the smell alone DarkGlow can tell it's not water. One swig later, he's packing up his fancy toy and heading for the door. "Things to do, things to do..."

He heads back out of the building, and right into the rush of students released from class, thoroughly crowding the walkway and path towards the Science building.

Thomas curses thoroughly, as he realizes what has just happened. He emerges from the floor into a supply closet and leaps forward - out of the closet, through the wall, and out of most of his costume. His black boots remain on, but the tank top and shorts he wears underneath won't be too inconspicuous... Hopefully nobody will look down... And with this done, Thomas Temple begins pursuit of the man with the box.

Guy finds an isolated place to communicate with his teammates via the handy radios, "Uh guys? I think he's leaving the office... what should we do? I can follow him easy enough, I think."

Guy continues, "Or I can check his office."

From a shadow a few metres along the building's wall from the door, DarkGlow looks with some dismay at the crowd Blake vanished into. _Wonder if he planned that..._ Teleporting invisibly from stray shawdow to stray shadow, he attempts to keep up with the man.

Something stops DarkGLow, however. He emerges from the shadow of a tree along the walkway, and something just... clicks, like a door opening in his mind. He recalls himself falling into the bushes, shot, feeling fear and death. Then he sees himself, little, oh so young, and screaming like a banshee as that pain and fear wash across him like a tidelwave, before falling over. THe first he... doesn't remember, but the second it... before NightStar showed up, before everything.

Ming is in the crowd, trying her best to avoid getting jostled. Of course, being short and rather small in the frame, she's easily overlooked and getting bumped about is the normal for her. The books she carries are clutched tight to her chest, pinned against her lab coat. However, she isn't quite ready to see Thomas and her attempts to change direction are foiled by a jostling from behind, which pushes her right into her student. The books are dropped and it's all Ming can do just to keep her feet in the bustle.

Thomas aughs, growling at the distraction. "Oh, professor," he grunts, noting the familiar face instantly. No time for this, no time... DarkGlow must also be in pursuit, so we can waste a couple seconds... He squats, grabbing deftly at book after book to retrieve his teacher's dropped burden.

Guy continues to trail after the fellow, having received no instructions to the contrary, he works his way through the crowd, slipping deftly between passing students and professors alike. Almost like he's done this before... strange.

Ming looks down as Thomas bends to get her books and of course she moves with him. "Thomas!" She sounds surprised, at first, and then she says, "You missed class today. The class missed you. Your questions are always so helpful to us." Her scolding is a tease, of course, but her next question is anything but. "Did you buy some new boots?"

Thomas hangs his head, cheeks burning. Why this, why now? I'm on the trail of something important, why do I have to be this, now..? "Sorry," he grits. "I'm doing some very important work for Mr. Lydon Yamaguchi, it's for my education.." He thrusts the handful of books forward, squarely, hoping to be excused civilly so as not to arouse suspicion.

Prof. Blake moves through the crowd, waving to a few individuals while pushing past into the University Center, and making a B-line for the cafeteria, and gets in line for the deli there, bouncing on his heels.

Ming takes the books and raises her eyebrows. "Is something wrong, Thomas? You don't seem like yourself." And this is when the teacher's most annoying and odd feature kicks in. She has to start acting like a fretting mother. She'll reach up, trying to put a hand to Thomas' forehead. "Do you have a fever?"

Thomas flinches but holds his ground, unable to do anything but act the part. "No, professor, everything's fine, I'm just sort of in a hurry right now, so if you'll please excuse me.." .. So I can go chase after a guy who may be carrying a freaking BOMB and save the world twice today..

"You are up to something," says the professor, waggling a finger at her student. "But go ahead, chase whatever you are after, but you had better show up for my office hours later if you don't want to get a detention!" She has to say something absurd like that to keep him off-balance. Ming isn't in his way anymore, at least. But she'll probably sneak after him anyway.

Thomas whews, almost sprinting away to continue the pursuit as fast as he can.

Ming will watch Thomas run, a small smile coming to her lips. "Silly kids," she murmurs. She'll start making her way to her lab in the science building, pondering in silence as she so often does.

Prof Blake is having a conversation with the student beside him at the deli over the scientific ramifications of lint. "So lint has _that_ much in it, hm?" Replies the old man. "Wow. I never knew my pants had such culture." Of course, it's his turn to order. A BLT, with mayo, and some barbeque sauce.

Pain and fear pound at DarkGlow's control like a hammer, and in the struggle to keep his mind from fracturing he's barely aware of an instinctive leap through shadow to some barren, empty field, sheltered only by the tree in whose shadow he emerges. Later he would reflect on the stupidty of blindly leaping when he already knows something can change the intended destination of his walks through shadow, but at the moment he's on his knees and one hand, with the other cupping his mouth as he tries not to vomit. _Not me,_ his mind whispers, _I've never been shot,_ but with a whimper continues, _but good God it hurts..._ His gorge finally recedes, but he takes nothing in from a cursory look around. _Even so, I'm not dead. That other bastard might be, but I'm not._ He attempts to stand, staggers drunkenly. _Alone and hurt and afraid--those I've been. Those I remember, those I know to the core, have known to the core since the beginning._ His knees lock, and mental steel starts to stiffen his spine. _And I'm still_ here_!_

It's when his eyes open wide and start to burn with angry heat that he realizes that he's overbalancing the other way. _Put away with the fear and pain. But also put away the anger. Attack or not, warning or not, it's just my phantom friend. It's over and done and..._ He looks more closely around. _...and where the hell am I, anwyay?_

For a single, clear moment, DarkGlow's mind touches with another's. It's a surprise for both of them, and yet feels almost familiar. So far away, yet they are together; DarkGlow can see NightStar's scared, startled mind, just as she can see his. She's not in the city, not even in this side of the country. But she's alive. The moment's over.

Receiving his sandwich, the professor wanders over into the seating area, setting his bag down carefully beside him.

"So yeah, I think the guy is having a conversation about lint. Hey GK? Can ya hear me?" Guy has to chuckle, and he orders something that might once have passed for food, paying for it with several weatherbeaten dollars. "Here ya go. Thanks." He goes to take a seat elsewhere, still intent on making sure the bomb, if that's what it is, doesn't fall into the wrong hands.

Thomas has both hands stuck firmly in the pockets of the shorts he's wearing, too busy swearing inwardly to notice the faint sounds coming from the radio in one pocket. He sighs at last, taking a seat at the far corner of the cafeteria. He tugs the radio just free enough of the pocket to use it, and his powers create a contained cone of sound into the microphone: **I have him under observation.**

Ming stops before getting anywhere close to the lab, looking down and listening to her stomach grumble in displeasure. She sighs and turns, heading towards the deli with a frown. She hates wasting time eating when she could be doing much more useful things! At least she has her books with her. She'll grab herself a sandwich and then look for a place to set herself. And that's when she sees a fellow professor that she has wanted to talk to! Of course that would be Professor Blake.

Blake, of course, spots Ming as well and offers her a wave while digging into his sanwich.

DarkGlow makes his cautious way back to the campus, a chill in his soul that he's never felt before. At the campus, he flits through shadow to Blake's office, but finds neither GhostKnight nor Guy there. He doesn't even feel the prickle of embarrassment as he radios the others to let them know he lost Blake and ask where they are; beside everything else, that emotion is just too... petty.

Ming heads over towards Blake, "Mind if I join you?" she asks. As one of the youngest faculty members in the history of the university, she's gotten used to showing a lot of courtesy to those with tenure.

**I am observing Blake,** reports the Ghost, in response to DG's inquiry. Tom sits back with a sigh, banging his head in slow motion against the wall behind him.

"Surely," The professor calls, patting the table in front of him. "Have a seat. And how are you doing today doctor? I bet you have thirteen organisms in your pocket."

DarkGlow mentally shrugs. "Everything's well in hand then. I think I'll kick off early." A pale attempt at humour: "Any idea where the punch clock's been hidden this time?"

"Same here. Some chick's gone and sat down with him. Someone with organisms in her pocket." Guy chuckles again, and he wonders, "Is there anything else we should do? And the punch clock is in the cafeteria. Order the beef stroganof... that'll take you off of anyone's clock."

Thomas sighs to himself. His armor's back in some janitor's closet. He's sitting here wearing his boots and hot-summer wear, with a radio in his pocket, staring at a patronizing professor and a guy who is carrying around a gizmo that defies description. Where oh where did he start to go wrong?

"Probably some very good samples," replies Ming, smiling pleasantly at Blake as she sits down. "It's been a good day, though. I think we may have a few very promising students coming in this semester, even if they aren't interested in focusing on genetics. How has your day been, Professor Blake?"

"Oh, quite well! I just got back from merry old England. And, I'm going to do something extravagant tomorrow." Blake grins quite thankfully. "Have you ever seen the movie 'Event Horizon'?"

Ming shakes her head, her expression apologetic, "No, I fear not. My parents did not want me to watch movies. My father was impatient whenever I didn't have a book in my hand." She asks more seriously, "Do you recommend it?"

Blake shakes his head. "Dreadful movie, no. But, there's a phrase that my colleagues like to say. 'Science Fiction is merely good ideas with bad executions'." His hands spread wide. "Dimensional rifts. Proof that they exist."

"Is this new research you are going to pursue, then?" asks Ming. "I wonder what you might find. I guess there is but one way to find out." She prepares herself to hear the professor explain his ambitions, but won't be surprised if she is left out of his plans.

A wag of his finger. "Oh, not quite yet! I'm going to find out if it works. I won't bore you with lots of physics mumbo jumbo; Dimensional Physics is a new field and quite... hard to condense in a few minutes of discussion. But, to put it in terms that really matter, I use this thing here, and something quite interesting happens." After a moment, "Assuming I'm not vaporized, but that'd be interesting for a spectator, I gather."

"Dimensional rifts," intones Guy softly into the radio. "Great. Hope you guys know how to deal with the beasts from dimension XYZ..."

Ming raises her eyebrows, wondering just what on earth 'this thing' is. Well, she might as well try to find out. "This thing here? And just what is that? And where would you find such a thing?" She won't comment about the vaporization part. She just hopes that's a joke. Or maybe this whole thing is?

Blake unzips the bag, and extracts the fancy brick. "A quite fabulous electromagnet. I propose that gravity links parallel universes; if they are suppored, parallel to Earth, then they must be on the earth's axis."

Ming will study the magnet closely, then look back to the professor. "It's an interesting theory, but I'm not sure just how you will penetrate another dimension. We can't even be sure what might happen if you fail or if you succeed." She tilts her head, "I suppose with some heavy research you might be able to safely experiment transferring particles, but I also imagine you have something much more tangible in mind."

"Hey Ghost Knight," Shawntae comes on over the radio. "You looked at today's paper in the Millennium City Free Press?"

Thomas beats his head against the back wall even harder. **I have not,** comes the well-disguised reply. **Summarize please.**

"Well... Someone's calling you out, WWF style. And I quote 'Dear Dead Guy, yeah you, punk crime fighter. I'm going to shut you down. Time and place, at 423-873-5520.'"

Blake shakes his head. "It's hard to explain specificly, but I and a few colleagues have been tinkering for half a year on this project. I'll let you know how it goes tomorrow, Hm?"

Thomas just holds his head in his hands and restrains himself from weeping. Why today of all days, for everything to happen? Everything was so simple before today...

Ming nods to the professor, finally starting to eat. She will just have to see what comes of it, if anything. And then she notices Thomas. Hmm.. and he's looking at her? She puts a hand to her mouth and smiles to herself. My, my, it seems she has an admirer! To the professor she says, "Well, I look forward to hearing about your success."

"Oh, GK? Yeah. I just got a call from the Champs. Apparently they smacked the punks around who went to shoot up the station? They're not tongs. Apparently, they're a chinese gang. Champs have a report from the woman, too."

Thomas smacks his palm into his forehead for a moment. **Go ahead.**

"Well, I'll just shave it down for you. She named a name: Hao Kinyosh. The name doesn't check up on any police records, or any legal documents at all. Either an alias, or someone's an illegal."

Ming politely excuses herself from the professor's table, saying, "If you will excuse me, there is a student I must talk to." And with that, she'll take her sandwich and books and head right over towards Thomas.

Thomas lifts his head from his hands. NOW what? "Uh, hey, professor," he says nervosly. What the hell? Is it my cologne or something? Or am I just being punished for my sins?

"Thomas," greets Ming. "I guess you didn't want to wait until office hours. Was there something you wanted to talk to me about? You know I'm not really mad at you for missing class. Things happen." She can't help but notice that Thomas is acting strangely, at this point.

"Uh, no, prof, everything's fine," says Tom meekly. "I'm just very stressed out..." Oh, to be back in my armor again right now... GK is far more confident than I am.

Ming looks Thomas over, her expression making it clear that she doesn't think Thomas is doing very well at all. "Maybe you should rest? You seem to not be yourself at all today! You are a good student, and I'm concerned. Are you sure there is nothing you want to talk about?"

Thomas nods emphatically. "Absolutely, everything's fine, I guarantee," he mumbles, the words coming out on automatic pilot.

Ming looks at Thomas intently, studying him very closely for a time. Her eyebrows shoot up. Well, that's interesting! She doesn't say anything, she just stands there, looking at Thomas and learning all sorts of things that would dismay the young man to no end.

Ming goes from curious-looking to stunned to, well, thrilled and very very excited. "Wow," she says softly. She isn't likely to explain, she's too busy violating Tom's privacy.

Thomas gives his professor a look that one might give to day-old mackerel. "Professor... you're all quiet," he observes.

Ming laughs nervously, coming out of her musing. Or Thomas' musings? Whatever! "Wow, it's so cool!" She won't ask, she just sits by Thomas and smile at him in a way that would send terror into even the bravest heart. It just screams 'I know something you don't know.'

Thomas sighs, pocketing the radio as best he can without inciting notice. "Professor? Is there something you want?" he asks flatly.

Ming grins widely, "You sneaky, sneaky boy," she murmurs. "I can't believe it. You know how fascinated I am with genetics, and here you hide a fascinating case study from me! It's very unfair." She mock-pouts at Thomas, then grins again. "And here I thought you were just following me because you had some kind of crush."

"Huh?" is Tom's most eloquent reply. "What case study? And who's following you? I'm just here to relax."

Ming looks around suspiciously, then turns to Thomas, meeting his eyes. She does not speak, though her voice is clear in his mind. << You are the Ghostknight. It's an honor to meet a real, living super hero! I'm so excited! I hope you have time to help me with my research! I simply must have more samples, and it would be such an aid to the future of humanity! I'm sorry to find out this way, but I was afraid you were interested in me in an inappropriate way, and I wanted to know how to let you down and now you are such a big hero and I hope you can forgive me! >>

Thomas simply gets up and walks away from the table. His thoughts are seething. A telepathic teacher? His identity outed? All in the space of sixty seconds. This day has turned into something indescribable. **Discontinue surveillance,** he remarks curtly into the radio, striding rapidly away, hoping to get to his armor without attracting too much notice...

"You've got it GK. So what do we do then?" Guy looks confused. He finishes off the rest of his meal, if it can be called that. "This isn't the thing, I take it?"

Ming blinks and sits up straight as Thomas moves away. For a moment, she hesitates, but she's not going to be dumped that easily! She's going to follow him, matching step for step. Since he's not looking her way, she can't 'talk' to him as she wants, but she will keep up. "Thomas, please don't run away. It was a mistake! I won't cause you any trouble, I promise." She tries to not draw attention, though it's kind of hard not to on a school campus.

Thomas waits until he's across the open ground and at the steps of the building wherein his armor is stored. "Who are you really?" he demands angrily, whirling. "And what do you really want with me?"

"I am Professor Tiaoning Ming," she replies simply. "And I just want to learn more, I guess. I've always been fascinated by those in your line of work." She will choose not to use her telepathy right now, since Thomas was rather enraged by it. "Everyone knows how fascinated I get by this kind of thing. At least I figured they would, everyone seems to give me a hard time about it. Besides, we're not all that different, are we?"

"But my profes...." my professor's not telepathic. The unstated assumption that underlies Tom's universe, that his college life and super-existence are kept apart. He sort of gapes, not knowing what to say. "Fine. You want to talk to me? Let's go talk." And with that he wheels, passing into the building and walking for the closet.

Ming is incapable of being upset or bothered. This is still wonderful to her. She's talking to a super hero! She will follow quickly. "I must confess I'm very surprised! I have never had a student who did so much community service."

In the closet, Tom is assembling his armor, sliding into it carefully. He slips on his black trench at last, smoothing it down with two gloved hands, eyes carefully following the comforting and familiar lines of the suit rather than looking at his professor.

Ming will just loiter and marvel. Ghostknight! She hunts around in her books, pulling out a paper she's written in secret. She cradles it carefully and digs out a pen. "Umm, if you have a moment, could I get your autograph?" she asks softly.

Thomas turns to the side and just starts thumping his forehead against the unforgiving concrete wall. "You want my WHAT?" he asks after a moment.

"Umm, your autograph? Please? I mean, it would mean so much to me!" Ming bounces on her feet, looking more like a thrilled child on Christmas than a professor. "This is so exciting for me! To meet the real thing at last!"

"I'm not... Professor Ming, what can I tell you, I..." Tom hangs his head, sighing. "I just think that -- Oh hey, Charlie," he calls, interrupting his moment as a fraternity friend passes the closet. "Anyway, look, please just forget about me, okay?"

Charlie rocks by. He's a good student, but today is a Monday, and he was way too happy last night. His eyes are a little bloodshot and his brows are knit. All he needs is 'Hangover' on his forehead. "Hey Tom. Nice threads," He says half heartedly, though glances at Prof. Ming.

Ming looks at Charlie and then back to Thomas. She just smiles, "Yeah, he's just trying on something for me. It's just like the real thing, isn't it!" Hehehehe, could her smile be any more forced and unrealistic?

"Hey... GK... you there? Uhm... how'd that go... ah right, come in?" Guy's voice chimes, breaking the awkward silence for a moment.

Thomas looks down at the radio, then up at his professor, and down at the radio, and quietly resumes beating his head against the concrete wall, praying for the sweet mercy of oblivion.

"Your hair isn't right to look like a good Vengance," Charlie comments. Vengance being a recently released vigilante movie. "Don't change with the door open man, don't moon everyone." Charlie with that closes the door.

Ming blinks a few times and bites back the urge to giggle at how distraught Thomas is. Here is her great super hero cracking under the pressure from a young, more or less defenseless woman. "You should take it easy on the building, Thomas." And then the door shuts. "Umm." These doors don't lock, do they? Do they?

There's a clicking sound. From within, just one phrase can be heard. "Uh-oh."

Ming hears the click and hmms. In the dark, she asks, "So, umm, how about that autograph?"
