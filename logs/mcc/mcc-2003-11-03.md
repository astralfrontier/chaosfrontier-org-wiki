"Goooood morning Millennium City, your News at Noon top stories. Three Board members of Dew Chemicals went to court today; apparently after a foiled assault on them yesterday, the trial process has been sped up. They are facing charges of embezzlement, conspiracy to maim, and unlawful disposal of chemicals; interestingly enough, all three have pleaded guilty."

Several news items down the list, "And finally, on a lesser note, Foxbat has struck again!" The camera shifts a helicopter shot of Millennium University's football stadium, then the camera takes up Dr Ernest P. Blake's face. "I was testing a new device of mine, and I and a select few were demonstrating a Dimensional Relocator and then we heard some cheesy music." Footage shows Foxbat, a man in multi-shaded brown uniform glide in and snatch the device from Blake. In the corner, off to the side Lydon Yamaguchi can be seen, before the camera falls over. Back to the newscaster. "The mediocre villain has stolen Dr. Blake's invention, and is considered a liable danger with the machine."

"In other news, Wednesday is slated for the unveiling of the Largest Cubic Zirconium. Among the display of the most famous artificial jewelry includes the imitation diamond estimated at four inches in diameter. It will be on display at the Millennium City Mall Wednesday through Friday, before its' next stop in Chicago."

Shawntae comes over the radio. "Guys? Anyone listening? Ghost Knight, you out there? Somebody pick uuup."

"Yeah yeah, I'm here," radios Guy, "What do you need?" He is in his favorite reclining pose, feet propped up on desk and listening to the radio while he awaits his next case.

DarkGlow blinks away the afterimages that the candle he'd been staring at left in his vision. _Meditation wasn't going all that well, anyway..._ he thinks with a sigh. Standing, he walk over to his cloak and fishes out the radio. "DarkGlow here. What's up?"

"Lydon, Tengu, whatever. I just got a call from the Champs. Somebody just tore a fucking HOLE in a Greymalkin facility, and started busting shit up. By the time they got there to do something about it, got themselves smacked around and Tengu got away. We have **problems** people."

"Er... a Greymalkin facility? Who's he that got away? Will someone lemme know what's up? Clear things up a bit Shawntae, I think?" Guy sounds reasonably confused.

DarkGlow attempts a clarification: "Someone stole Tengu and smacked the Champions around with it? Heh--guess the suit's better than I thought. I take it Lydon's out of communication?"

"Right, DarkGlow," Shawntae replies. "Sorry man, a little incoherent. No, I havn't heard jack or shit from Lydon at all. He ain't answering his radio, not answering his cellphone, nothing. I don't know if he's gone or what."

DarkGlow mentally winces. "I hope he didn't object to the thief too strenuously... Any idea if the thing has remote tracking built in to it?"

"What? Naw... that _can't_ be right. Lydon?" Guy shakes his head as though in disbelief, in fact to further prove his disbelief, the sound of a detective falling backwards in a chair can be heard over the radio soon after.

The line is silent for just a second, before Shawntae replies, "Never thought of that. I'll go look throught the computer system in his lab to see if something like that is operational. Listen, you guys decide to meet somewhere, I'll keep trying to get ahold of Ghost Knight."

**We will meet at the Greymalkin building,** announces a voice over the radio link. **Immediately.**

DarkGlow blinks. "I was thinking more of checking out where the suit is normally stored..."

"Speak of the dev-er-Ghost Knight. Hi. Where's the Greymalkin then," asks Guy as he gets to his feet and rights his chair. "I'll be there... oh nevermind, see you guys there."

**Whatever is there will stay as it is,** replies the Ghost calmly. **Please meet me there.**

"I'll get that in a minute," Says Shawntae. "You go do your thing; I'll go do my magic."

"Sounds reasonable," DarkGlow says agreeably. "On my way..."

Thomas calmly puts the radio back into his backpack, and rises from his seat in class, trotting down the aisle as several heads turn to look at him curiously. "Uh, professor," he mumbles in a low voice. "I ah, need to take care of some business. For, like, the rest of the day. I need a cover story. What's it gonna take?"

Ming blinks a few times, raising an eyebrow. Her voice isn't hushed, "Oh my, that serious?" she says. "Well, if they need us, they need us, right?" To the joy of many students, Ming announces, "I'm afraid class will have to be postponed. The quiz will be bumped back until next week!" No way is he getting away without taking her.

Thomas blinks. "Us?" he manages. Well, if that's what it takes.. "Anyway. Uh. Yeah, come on." And with that he leads the way out of the classroom, cheeks burning.

Greymalkin Inc Deals with various technologies, plastics, and a slew of other areas. The roof has a sizable hole has been left like a laughing mouth. With the Ghost Knight looking it over, it's obvious that the hole erupted from the underside - or if it was Tengu, was pulled up rather then pushed in. The interior is a wreck. Lab equipment, machinery, even walls have been torn apart. The ambulances have all ready carted out the wounded, except for Kinetik who's waiting patiently until the initial survey is made. Standing several yards from him with a small centrifuge is an older man with salt a salt and pepper beard and hair, wearing a suit that cost no less then seven hundred dollars.

The uninjured security guards offer a rough summary. Tengu attacked, they came running, several workers were all ready fleeing or held down by rubble or under the suit's powers. They had held him off by the time Kinetik showed up. Some computer hard drives, as well as some several thousand dollars worth of equipment and supplies were stolen, but the purpose of none have been eluded to. Either the guards don't know (which is what they say), or they are hiding something. With Greymalkin glowering beside them, employee loyalty is likely a must.

Kinetik seems a little perturbed by the situation, mainly because he did not get many licks in. The heaps of equipment and debris in the center is where Tengu had drawn it in a ball, causing the speedster to slam into it. That's when he held him down and pummeled him, then left him hanging in the air while the escape was made.

GK inclines his head thoughtfully as he listens to all this. Finally he nods, and selects a few of the more recaltricant guards and witnesses, gathering them together. **I would like for you all to give brief statements to a professional I have brought to the scene,** he explains. **She has some professional knowledge of superhumans and their psychology, and anything you can offer her on the matter would be of inestimable value.** He chuckles softly. **While you are speaking to her, I would like to offer my services for repair. Nothing sensitive, naturally, but your roof, for example...**

Thomas then steps aside, gathering DarkGlow and Guy in a huddle, ensuring a zone of silence thereabouts with his powers, for a conference.

Shawntae comes on the radio. "Uh, guys? I have... freaky news."

**Speak,** says GK.

"Freaky news...?" Guy muses, into his radio, "This can't be good. But go on..."

"Tengu's suit is turned off, and in his lab. And from what I can tell, it hasn't left all day." Shawntae replies.

**Another suit then. If it's Lydon, he built a backup - sensibly enough. If it's not Lydon, someone got the schematics,** muses GK. **Either way. Gather what evidence you can of the suit's disposition, and have it forwarded to Greymalkin's Legal department and the police. I'm confident Lydon's lawyer is right over your shoulder and sweating...**

Ming will simply stand off to the side, trying to not draw attention. Not like she really can draw attention away from men dressed in outlandish costumes. Hearing some of what GK says, she adds, "If you could also give me your names and a contact number it would help greatly. It may be important to ask more questions later."

The security guards and the technicians who were there when it went down but fled give all of their brief statements to Ming, replying to the few questions she has, before giving information to reach them.

Shawntae sends over, "I'm on it."

Greymalkin walks over to the huddle, his mouth moving a moment but the words are blocked by the silence.

Thomas drops the zone of silence and stares at the new arrival. **Repeat yourself, please.**

Ming will listen carefully, storing all that information away in her mind and also making sure to tell as much as she can about who is speaking honestly and who is holding back or lying. Throughout this, she remains polite and sympathetic to the anxiety of the people she speaks to.

"Excuse me," Continues Greymalkin as though he had just began. His tone is chrisp and well oiled; while not yelling or even giving the overtone he's angry, he seems to just radiate subdued aggravation. "You are Lydon's employed agents, correct? Or have worked with his official corporate endorsed power suiter Tengu?" A gesture across the room. "I would like an explination and an audience with Mr Yamaguchi as soon as possible."

"I think that's the one thing many people would like at this point," replies Guy. "This day just keeps getting better and better."

**We are not his employed agents. We have at least worked with him,** replies the Ghost, patiently. **The Tengu suit itself is intact. Whoever ispiloting this suit is piloting a duplicate. Once we review your security-camera information and can establish a point of origin from witness accounts, we will have an explanation.**

His disapproval is evident, but he seems satisfied. "Very well. I believe Mr Willis will have a tape for you in the main security room. You are welcome to reconstruct what you will. If you find the individual who did this, I would also like the stolen property back to me post haste." As if on an after thought, "Thank you. You are welcome to reconstruct what you may."

With that, Greymalkin shoots a look at Guy, then DarkGlow, as if first noticing them. It's a knowing expression. With that, the corporate head turns and walks towards his men.

Thomas restores the zone of silence and pulls back his fleshless face in a grin. **How cooperative. Gentlemen, how shall we proceed?**

DarkGlow straightens from leaning against an out-of-the-way wall and stares after Greymalkin. _What was that look for...?_

"I'm not quite sure. Viewing the tape seems to be the first order of business. And I think we'll also have to see about finfing Lydon," muses Guy, somewhat helpfully, "I can try and track him down, I think."

Hoping (forlornly, perhaps, but still...) that the secutity cameras don't reach down into the infrared band, DarkGlow unobrusivly steps backwards along the wall and, when no one's looking near him, fades into the shadows. Mentally he examines the trace of shadow he'd been tracking since Greymalkin left his sight, and scans around its present location for an appropriate pool of shadow to teleport to. He glances at the others, throwing a longer, harder one at skullface's _guest_, and decides that tagging along to security would be pointless and boring, but not necessarily in that order. He waits patiently until Greymalkin passes the requisite shadow, and then wills himself there.

Ming, Ghost Knight and Guy are lead by Sgt Willis down to the security level. From the looks of how high tech the station is, Greymalkin has enough money and something worth protecting. The video center consists of a controls deck and two chairs for observation. The tape is inserted and viewed. From the camera's angle, it can spot the technicians looking up before one starts to run, then another. By then, workers are being pushed to the ground while equipment falls across them. Tengu himself enters - and from the looks of it there is no difference except for metalic silver talons then Lydon's chrome. Tengu goes straight for a certain computer terminal, lifting several pieces of half-formed equipment. Enter Kinetik. The battle ensues.

Guy watches, wincing as the battle ensues. He offers up commentary, "Oh... ow! That's gonna leave a mark... ahhh so that explains why he was walking that way." He looks back at Ghost Knight, then at the tape, "The resemblance is uncanny... but not quite perfect."

Ming looks from Guy to GK. To GK she suggests, "Perhaps we should speak more quietly, so that we need hide no secrets?" Hopefully he realizes she's not referring to whispers.

The camera gets a great shot across Tengu's back; a Japanese symbol is etched between the wings. If it was on Tengu's suit itself, it was never noticed, but the symbol itself is not significantly large. Kinetik is thus dragged up into the air, his legs churning fast enough to be a pure blur for the camera, but even his speed helps him not as Tengu escapes through the hole.

Saying nothing for a moment, the black stalker meditates on the scenes from the tape. Finally he beckons. **We will speak to Kinetik.**

As DarkGlow follows Greymalkin, he and his men - two having Bodyguard written all over them so thick it could be a tattoo - the corporate head walks to the elevator and they get in. As soon as the doors close, the shadow-stalker slips inside. "He stole it. How could he know precisely where the access codes were? The schematics? The machines wern't even _finished_, much less announced of their purpose to anyone but the workers. We may have a mole gentlemen."

_Not to mention a spy or two. But, pray, continue..._ Caution rules for the moment in DarkGlow's mind--he stands still as a rock, barely breathing.

"Those two men look suspicious. Familiar even. Take a note," He announces. The man beside him extracts a notepad. "Find out who they are. I want to know where I remember them from." The elevator doors open, and the group moves out into the lobby and into a lemo.

Kinetik is waiting upstairs. "Hey, Ghost Knight." Thumbs hooking in his belt, "Tell me something; you butt heads with the NPG?"

**Yes,** replies GK, somewhat shortly. **And won.**

Kinetik grins. "That makes two of us. Good work. So, you wanted something?"

**How did you arrive here?** is GK's first question. **In pursuit of Tengu, or otherwise?**

Ming sits quietly, seeming oddly subdued despite the fact that she's in the company of super heroes. Mabye she's gotten used to it and calmed down? Not friggin' likely!

Guy takes this time to ask Ming, "So what's yer name? What's yer story, and why in the world are you here?"

"Actually," Replies the Champ, "I was on a sting. I suspected there was a hideout that the NPG was taking up nearby. I was watching the place to see if any of the usual suspects came by. I saw the bricks hit the sky in my peripheral vision, and I was there soon enough."

"So you were on a sting, eh? Huh. I wonder if the NPG had anything to do with this... although it doesn't seem like it's their style. Their style is more like... 'fall down on the ground' when you take away those wonderful toys of theirs." Guy gives a rather winning grin, as is his wont. He looks back at Ming, "Well what'samatter? Cat got your tongue?"

Ming grins at Guy, her voice revealing a little.. distraction. "I'm Ming, a umm, friend of the Ghost Knight, you might say. He was kind enough to let me tag along and see just how he operates. I'm hoping he will help me do some valuable research. And who are you?"

"I'm not sure these days. But you're a friend of GK's eh? Well I suppose that explains why you've tagged along. What kinda valuble research canya do," asks Guy, as GK moves in to talk with Kinetik about battling Tengu.

Ming considers Guy for a moment, then explains, "I take it you don't really read science journals, so I'll try to keep it short and to the point. I'm a geneticist, I'm interested in what makes super heroes the way they are, and I'm thinking if I can get enough of them interested in helping me, I might find out. And maybe, I hope, help my sister."

Kinetik found Tengu's attack pattern very precise, like he had known exactly how to handle himself when dealing with someone like Kinetic; Tengu didn't flinch. Then in passing invites the Knight to a game of pool some time.

"I'll have you know I do read science journals. Some of 'em anyway. A geneticist? Well that's interesting, to say the least. Although I don't want anyone dealin' with my DNA and it's makeup, not at all." Explains Guy, he ponders, "How would you help your sister though?"

Thomas only inclines his head once, a polite but silent agreement to Kinetik's offer. Nothing like establishing more cordial relationships with the 'day-time' super-team.

"It's a simple story," Ming says softly. "She was hurt in an accident, and she can't walk." The professor sighs quietly and looks away, "I'd rather not talk about it. She's a very good girl, and she is smart and popular, but.. she should have legs that work. She deserves a fair chance."

Guy hmms at that, "You ought to look into cybernetics lady. That sort of thing works wonders, from what I understand. Or atleast some kind of... robot legs, maybe. Not sure. It'd help to give a chance, if nothin' else."

Ming hmms at Guy and looks over to Kinetik, "Maybe, but.. I want her real legs to work. If you will excuse me a moment?" She can't resist, she has to head on over to see what GK and Kinetik are up to.

"... and that's where we get the term 'Threshold'." Kinetik pauses. "Yeah, I can ramble." His attention shifts over to the approaching Ming. The Champ gives her a little wave.

Ming, despite the rather depressing topic of a moment's past, is all happiness now. She reaches into her pocket and draws out a book. A book GK should recognize. And of course, a pen. "Hi, I'm very sorry to interupt, but I was wondering if you might do me a huge favor. It will only take a moment."

Kinetik reaches forward and collects the book and pen, flipping to a few pages like he is all too familiar with the procedure. "Anything paticular you want down?"

Thomas says nothing. A bit of damaged wall rises from the groud where it lays, and begins smacking softly against his helmeted head, thus saving him the trouble of having to move to accomplish the same deed the normal way.

Ming bounces slightly on her toes, briefly shooting Thomas a dirty look as if to say 'this is how _real_ super heroes are supposed to act'. "Oh, anything is fine. It's really a pleasure to meet a great hero. And it is so kind of you to hang around to help Ghost Knight out." She half-implies that he needs it, there!

With a chuckle, the man's wrist flicks several times, unearthly fast. "No problem. The rest of you guys are welcome to a game of pool or something. We don't have water coolers, so we might as well work together."

Ming smiles at Kinetik, watching his wrist move and laughing softly. "That's impressive!" She waits calmly to get her autograph book back, smiling. Her sister won't believe this!

Kinetik hands the book back, grinning like a fool. He pats Ghost Knight on the shoulder while avoiding the segment on the wall. "And I'm out of here. You know how to reach me." And he's gone. His notation in Ming's book: "Anything is fine; from Kinetik on the Go."

"Alright. I'd work with ya if it came down to it." Guy gives a nod, "Although I have to warn you, I'm no good at pool."

On the roof of the Greymalkin Building, the Ghost has brought Ming and Guy together. **Guy,** the vigilante says sharply, with a hint of threat in his voice. **I want your assurance that you will keep the secret that is about to be made known to you. If you do not, I will end your life myself. I will have no compunction about doing so. Do you understand?**

"Uh... well seeing as how I have no choice in the matter, I may as well accept. Rest assured your secret will remain safe with me, but uh... before you go revealing anything terribly incriminating, there's somethin' you ought to know. And since my life's on the line, I may as well come clean." says Guy."

**Please do,** says the Ghost, calmly enough.

Ming just listens, not sure what to make of all this. She would rather be a few million miles away than in the first row of a super power battle.

"Well er y'see... it's an interesting story really..." And Guy sets about explaining the circumstances of his joining the team, and the perilous deal under which he exists at present. "I don't really have much choice in the matter here. But the guy has sources of his own. I've been doing the best I can to ignore him completely, or give him stuff he already knows. He has the impression I'm incompetent. Well... there you have it."

**I'm glad you are going to be so open with us. It will make things easier,** says GK. **Ming. My experience with telepaths tells me that they can almost always connect with more than one mind at a time. Is this true of you as well?**

"Only if you will allow it, full-willing," says Ming softly. She smiles and stretches a bit, "I'm not really as useful as strong telepaths, I'm afraid, but I can try to help out. Did you want to try?"

**Guy. Relax yourself and open your mind. Ming, come in. Connect our thoughts.** The Ghost relaxes himself, as he has before, calmly breathing and awaiting the sense of connection.

"Uh... open my mind?" He blinks at Thomas, "GK, yer scarin' me.... ohhhhh you mean metaphorically... see I thought you meant... ahhh I'm shutting up now." And with that, Guy shuts up and opens up his mind, as best as he can. He actually seems to understand this concept.

Ming looks from Guy to Thomas. She concentrates carefully, first opening the way to Thomas' mind, provided he doesn't fight. It's easier to wander in where you've been before. Then comes Guy. Ming studies him for a bit, and then carefully pushes her way inside. (( Do you hear me? Just think, don't talk. It can get kind of loud, too, so try to focus. ))

_Yeah yeah I hear you. Hey, just 'cause my office is the old storage room of a bar, doesn't mean I don't know what yer talking about. Or that I can't focus either. Where in the name of Sam Hain did I put my keys? Gah... I hope I remembered to turn off my coffeepot. I think it's developing intelligent life... my foot itches._ Well... Guy tries.

Thomas relaxes himself. (( Ming, I am going to engage my 'sense of perception'. It is a lot of information. Relay it to Guy just as you get it. )) **Guy. You are a professional detective; I am not. Make what you can of this scene, to whatever detail is possible. I want to establish what happened, because this was not done by the man we are used to.**

Ming stays focused, not nodding, though there is a clear sense of affirmation. The images are relayed cleanly, as if there were no barrier at all.

To Guy and Ming, all is black for a moment, as Thomas concentrates. Then the world changes, unfolding like a rose with an infinite number of petals. Here is the surface of the building, the strong roof. Its every detail is open to inspection; the folds of steel and ducts and wiring and insulation, visible into their final depth. Below, the air of the wounded building is similarly detailed. The slabs of roof that fell are intricately textured, with invisible threads of geometry leaping from them to touch the roof, as Thomas' agile mind instantly analyzes the pattern of their fall. The exact molecular composition of the substances in the building, from the chemical-laden air to the exceedingly complex arrangement of nasal filters stored in the emergency kits scattered here and there. Everything is open to inspection, save people. Two utterly black shapes, amorphous and menacing, crouch on the roof. Below, more zones of emptiness move about, and nothing can be sensed or felt 'past' them.

**You understand my power,** says GK, calmly, to Guy. **Use what you sense now. Use what you know of Tengu. Tell us what can be learned of the battle here.**

Ming wavers for a moment, but the link holds. Her eidetic mind floods with information unlike anything she's ever felt. Her soft gasp is echoed along the link as is the feeling of her astonishment. For the first time ever, she's hit by so much information she can barely handle it.

_Whoa._ Guy has to blink at the sensations that are unfurled to him. Well... so much for keeping his mind the same way throughout his life. _Okay. Now my nose itches. Whoa. So what do you want me to figure out? I can see how the things fell, and I can see where he got in. My guess is that he had someone working with him though. I should have had a better breakfast. I should do situps. I'll start tomorrow. He being this fake Tengu. Hmmm. Lemme see what else I can figure out._

Ming silently fine-tunes the link, carefully filtering stray thoughts out whenever she can. And also bracing herself for still more wild flows from GK.

Finally the Ghost breaks off his transmission, once the trio has learned all that can be learned. **Ming, desist,** he murmurs. **We must pay a call on Dr. Ernest P. Blake.**

Ming drops her connection and lets out a soft sigh. "Professor Blake, huh?" she murmurs to herself. "I suppose that can be arranged easily enough."

Dr. Ernest P. Blake is at home. A quick check of his home address from the Physics department send the trio there. A bottle of liqour is laying like a dead soldier on the floor. He's pacing back and forth, and yanks the door open. "I don't want an- oh, hello."

Thomas grimaces. **Dr. Blake. We wish to talk to you about Lydon Yamaguchi. And Foxbat, I suppose,** he adds with evident distaste.

Ming looks to Gk and then back to Dr. Blake. "I think these gentlemen can help you get your device back. I thought you'd want to see them as soon as possible."

"FOXBAT! The git weasel of a man! Come in, come in." Blake waves them in, "Yes, please... you are familiar." He stares at Ghost Knight a little wobbly.

"Hiya Ernie. We've come to talk to you about the stuff that's been going on as of late. Maybe even figure out what this whole mess is about," replies Guy. He ponders, "Foxbat? A git weasel? I always thought of him as a prat..."

"In any case," says Ming. "We are here to help, if you are interested in catching him. I want to see your research come to fruition, and I know how frustrating it can be to focus on something only to have it pulled away."

"Yes! I saw you on the television," He concludes after staring at Ghost Knight. "You give that arm-flapping rodent a sound thrashing." Leading everyone into the living room, "Indeed. I had almost all of my grant money funneled into that thing and I swear..." A shake of his head. "Foxbat flew in and he gave this ignorant presentation, babbling on about Master plan this, Master Plan that... Would you like something to drink? Anyone?"

Thomas politely declines.

"Er... nah that's alright. Need to keep senses y'know." Guy explains, then asks, "So he babbled on about some kinda Master Plan? I don't suppose y'have the details?"

Ming shakes her head, "That's fine, for now we will just listen, but thank you." She's all ears, for now.

"Not a damn thing. Something about a cubawhatsit at the Mall. Any ways," Blake continues, "He fires this ping pong ball and there's a plume of smoke and he grabs the machine. By the time I get out of the cloud, I see the man's boots disappearing through the... is there a name for the tunnel the football players come out of? Anyways, he went that way. And Mr. Yamaguchi was chasing after him. Probably went after my machine; never found out what happened to him, but I'm guessing the rodent got away and he didn't want to show up. The police would've found something otherwise right?"

Thomas sighs. **Find Foxbat and we find Lydon, I imagine,** he muses.

"Tunnel," offers Ming, unhelpfully. "It's hard to say, the police occasionally make small mistakes. The mall? You mean that stupid hunk of zirconia?"

Blake flails his hands. "I wasn't paying attention, I had smoke in my eyes. He was rambling on, I don't know. Perhaps, maybe. Does that help any?"

Thomas nods. **It does.**

"Of COURSE! He plans to steal the World's Largest Cubic Zirconium, and the Lydon and Tengu are all part of some kind of elaborate scheme to do so..." Or so says Guy.
