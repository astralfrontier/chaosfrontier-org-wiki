# Millennium City Chronicles 2003-11-15

Ming sits at home, waiting for Thomas to stop by. The pretense is schoolwork, should anyone official ask. The reality is, well, quite different, of course.

There's a short, sharp series of knocks at the door. Outside is Thomas Temple, looking a little ragged. _Why me?_ he thinks to himself.

He really shouldn't be so negative! You'd think Ming was evil. Anyway, she gets up and heads to the door, opening it after looking out the peep hole. "I'm glad you came. I was afraid you might start avoiding me." Once he enters, she shuts the door. After a pause, she also locks it.

Thomas just sighs. "What can I do for you, professor?" he asks wearily. His hands are in his pockets; his mind is in turmoil. _Sure, I used her to help my investigations. And sure, she took advantage of my thoughts. So we're square. Right?_

"Please sit down," says Ming. "And feel free to help yourself," she adds, gesturing to a plate of cookies set out there, as well as some milk. "My little sister really wanted to do something special for you, so she made you some cookies. I wanted to thank you, but I'm not sure how. You gave my sister a normal life that no one else could have."

Thomas sits quietly, cookie in hand. "Not alone," he observes. "Anyway, thank me as I requested. Keep my secret. It's... well, it's the only way I'll have a normal life for myself."

"That doesn't sound like enough," answers Ming. "I would have done that anyway. There is something else, though, when you are trying to think of something. Your father contacted me." She doesn't say what she so wants to, though.

Tom nods. "I told him about you. It was the easiest way. I trust he was't too much of an asshole." He sits back, calmly taking a bite out of the cookie and staring at the floor.

"I'm worried that he might harm my sister," says Ming. "He seems a very difficult, unpleasant man." She sighs, looking from Thomas back to the cookies, "They are good, aren't they?"

Nodding, Tom takes another bite. "He won't harm her," he says flatly. "That's not his way. He... He's a difficult man. But he's not evil."

"That is a relief, at least," says Ming. "He seems to think I've invaded his turf." She fidgets a bit, looking towards the door. "If he comes back I'm not going to be so pleasant. I don't appreciate someone acting threatening towards my sister."

Tom hmms. "Did he actually threaten her?" he asks, frowning. He shakes his head, not quite understanding.

"He hinted that he might do something," Ming replies. "You know nobody knows what I am. Nobody until you, and now he knows."

"Well if you're worried he'll tell anyone, set your mind at ease," suggests Tom with a smile. "Dad's many things, but he's very, very good about keeping secrets. You might say it's his hobby."

"Who else knows?" asks Ming softly. "This could cost me my job. My sister doesn't even know."

"Myself. My dad." Tom shrugs. "I won't tell anyone else. I know he sure as hell won't."

Ming nods slowly, "Good. Anyway, how is school going for you?" Apparently Ming is tired of this subject. Or she'll put it off until later.

"I sort of ignore school these days," the young man says with a sigh. "I have friends, I have an S.O., I skip my classes and hand in A+ papers. I mean, it's not a challenge, and I'm glad. It's more like a shelter now. I like it like that."

Ming hmms quietly, "Then it's also not serving its purpose, Thomas." She frowns thoughtfully, "You know, you could help me in the lab. Most of the group isn't.. well." She sighs, "They aren't really up to speed. They don't keep up, though I think they try."

"And how would I help?" Tom asks, a little wearily. "I used to do this night job part-time. Now it's getting almost to be a full-time thing."

"Well, I'm sure I can think of a lot of things you can do," says Ming. "And I can pay you, if that matters. What do you actually want to do with your life, Thomas?"

"I want to help people, and make the world a safe, good place to live in," he replies. Lofty goals indeed, but spoken directly, with honesty. "I wish for evil men to fear, and for good men to feel secure."

"You really think that's reasonable?" asks Ming. "I mean, honestly. Looking at history, it would seem an impossible goal. It is worth trying, but it's important to be a little realistic, too."

Thomas smiles, and extends his hand. A cookie flies to it, unbidden, unguided except by this young man's will and force of concentration. "My power is to change what's possible," he says, and takes a bite.

Ming smiles, "You really think that the powers you have are any more likely to go to good men than to bad?" Her voice is soft and serious, but when she answers herself it is sad, "I fear it is unlikely. In face, if the old principles are true, the reverse will happen. Power can corrupt, after all."

Thomas chuckles softly. "I'm probably as close to incorruptible as you can get. Let me ask you this. What do you offer a man to sway him to your side? Money, sex, drugs, precious gems or metals, influence over other men... I could have all those things myself. What little you could offer is in the negatives - threats against my family and friends and loved ones. And that's a temporary affair, because anyone who makes such threats knows I will be coming for him, sooner or later."

"You think corruption comes from external things?" asks Ming. "Corruption comes from your own mind, the devices you let it chase are not the cause. Aren't you at least a little afraid of what you can do?"

"Constantly." Tom settles back in the chair, taking another bite. "Have you ever gotten into a car that was a bit too small for you, professor? And eased yourself in, using your hand on the roof? There's a span of time - a second or two - between when you have your hand on the roof, and when you reach for the door to close it. Imagine, for a moment, that the door closes on your hand. It'd hurt, right? Your hand would go numb, probably all the way up your whole arm, as shock set in. It'd last maybe twenty to forty-five minutes. Most people aren't afraid of that, because to them, telekinesis isn't a factor in their daily lives."

"Doors. Unsteady walkways or guard-rails. Have you ever gone shopping, and looked up to see one of those big industrial air conditioners over your head, suspended by the thinnest of metal supports? Ever visualized what it'd do to your skull when it came down on it? For you, visualization and reality are a very long walk apart. For me... they are not."

"I think that fear helps you," answers Ming. "I can pry into just about any mind I want to. It's fairly easy, most of the time." She sighs softly, "I don't like talking about this. My power is rather unhelpful when it comes to aiding people, you know? It's just my luck."

Thomas nods slowly. "The fear does help me. I fear more what I would be without restraint. I imagine you have similar fears. But you could probably aid far more people than I, ultimately. That's why I've invited you along on our cases so far."

"It doesn't seem that way to me," answers Ming. "But I will do what little I can. I think it might be good publicity for the university, though I also am beginning to think I shouldn't go publically anymore."

Thomas nods. "That'd be safest. But, tell me something," he says. "If, tomorrow, a front-page headline in the newspaper appeared, explaining when and how the CEO of a major bank, for example, had funnelled money out of the bank.. what would happen?"

"What do you mean?" asks Ming. "I'd imagined he'd be arrested, in that case." She reaches down to try one of the cookies her sister made, managing a small smile.

Thomas nods. "And what else? Think beyond that, to the consequences. What about the bank's customers? What about the new CEO? What about CEOs of other banks, who had formerly thought about doing the same thing, maybe?"

"Some might be deterred," answers Ming. "But that's kind of a matter of sociology. From what I've studied of this area I've found that most criminals don't think of getting caught."

Thomas nods. "Ordinary detective methods don't permit most criminals to be caught," he replies. "But we are not ordinary detectives. Nor are we bound by society's laws, though I believe all of us are still party to society's larger, unwritten considerations. Policemen can only catch speeding criminals because they are allowed to break the speed limit in performance of their duties. What more can we do, who are not restricted to the letter of the law, only its spirit?"

"You have to be careful, though, since there are limits for a reason, Thomas," says Ming. "Imagine if you would a judicial system based upon someone like myself, who can read every last thought and potentially share it. What if I started deciding that this man wasn't really guilty of this, but he was evil nonetheless? We tread a dangerous line, I think." Ming puts a hand to the small of her back, stretching and cricking it. "Anyway, what made you decide to become.. well, to take up that other odd job of yours?"

"I was the dutiful son for many years," says Tom softly. "My mother died when I was 14. Up until that time, I accepted everything my parents told me. My dad was the strict authoritarian, my mom was the loving nurturer. I think that was sort of like chosen roles for them. Privately, now that I've had a few years to reflect on it, it seemed like they were doing a job, acting out these roles of Tough vs. Loving. But then.. Well, I think my dad got sort of stuckin his role. And I got to thinking, after he'd told me about my family and its history, that.. well, that there was no reasonable way she SHOULD have died. That it was preventable. If this was just about revenge, then.. I'd be out prowling the alleys and all that."

"I think I realized, then, in a very real way, what my parents had been teaching me. There is good and evil in the world, but nobody starts out as either one. So I thought about it." Tom leans back, speaking more contemplatively. "I realized the answer was simple. Find the reason people on the street turn to mugging, and drugs, and whatever. Deal with that reason, and everything else gets easier to fix. And that reason is the people in power, who permit those things to happen."

"Hmm," is all Ming offers for a response for a while. After some thought, she says, "So you are going after the people on top, mainly?"

Thomas nods. "Society places its trust in its rulers and leaders and luminaries. My role is to ensure that such trust is not violated."

"I suppose they do, at least in theory," says Ming. "Though honestly few people really care who rules them anymore. After all, the vast majority are corrupt anyway." She sighs softly, muttering, "This is all so philosophical and depressing."

Thomas smiles. "And what would happen, do you suppose, when society's most influential people became trustworthy and respectable, by and large? Would the masses not follow?"

"It's hard to say if the masses would believe it anymore," Ming replies. "And to do that you'd have to change the entire system that favors the dishonest. If you could achieve that task, you might see a change, but you can't expect that to be very quick, even if it were possible."

"I have plenty of time," says Tom, with a determined smile. "And I will not give up."

"I'm glad someone does," answers Ming, smirking. "Some of us might not even notice the world has changed."

Thomas shrugs. "You could help in this regard, if you chose. All you have to do is care enough to try. Care enough to risk."

"I already am set to do this, Thomas," answers Ming. "But.. it's not enough for me, I guess. Maybe that's selfish, but I'm not like you, nor any of the others. I'm just a normal person who can do things she feels are dangerous. My gifts are very unwelcome, honestly. At least they have done something of use, though. And they are helpful for my research."

Thomas nods, thoughtfully. "Can I show you something?" he asks.

Ming simply nods in response, watching Thomas closely.

Thomas gets up out of the chair, beckoning with a hand. "Let's go. You drive."

---

The apartment building is, like much of the old construction that predates Millennium City, located in the northern area, "old Detroit". Unlike some of its neighbor buildings, the establishment is in relatively good repair. Curtains, rather than bars, can be seen in the windows. Thomas walks up the steps, opening one of the double doors for Ming, and waiting for her to walk into the tiled hallway ahead of him. "I came here about six months ago," he says, running a hand along the walls as he walks. "It was in worse shape then."

Ming goes in, wondering just where this is going. She looks around, "I'm not really looking for an apartment," she says, trying to joke, though it's obvious her spirit is not in it.

Thomas shakes his head and smiles, a little wistfully. "If you were, this isn't actually a bad place. Rent is fair. The building is kept in good repair. Here..." He stops, drawing Ming's attention to a vertical scar in the wall, almost an inch thick. "This is the only hole that will never be patched in this building." He frowns in silent thought for a few moments. "This is where I caught up with the old landlord, about six months ago. After he tried to draw a knife on me, I stuck it through his hand here."

Ming tilts her head, nodding a little at Thomas. "I imagine you are trying to make some kind of point with this," she murmurs. "Besides talking about some poor man having a knife stuck through his hand, that is."

"After that, I called all the residents out," he continues softly. "I told them to look at what had happened, to listen to this man's promises that he would not allow pushers or peddlers through the doors, that he wouldn't be a slum-lord any more. I patched up everything in the building after that. Every leaky faucet, cold room, broken lock...Well, he tried to go back on his word, a month later, but I had another talk with him again." Tom shrugs. "This is a nice place to live now. People here don't feel like they are powerless any more. It makes them feel happier."

Ming nods slowly, "And did you enjoy having to do it that way?" she asks. She reaches out to run a finger along the tear, shaking her head. "Is this the way it must be?" she murmurs.

"Enjoy it? No, not really." Tom shrugs a little. "But you'd be surprised... Some people really don't know what it is to hurt someone else, until someone else hurts them. It can shock someone into perspective very fast."

"Thomas, I want to ask you a very honest question," says Ming. "Why do you want me involved in your other job? Nobody seems to want me around, and I've accomplished nothing at all of use, which is rather how I expect things to be, unless you start need information in the areas of chemistry and genetics. I could do that just as easily in other ways. Why bother bringing someone so limited with you? I will go, because I am indebted to you, but I want to know what you expect of me."

"Because Team Tengu is not a team," says Tom softly, sighing. "DarkGlow is an unknown commodity. He seems trustworthy, but I have my doubts. Guy Neville has confessed that he was sent to snoop on us. Together we could be formidable. But we aren't together." He turns to face his professor, smiling. "You can change that."

"Only if they want me to," answers Ming. "Only if they trust me. They clearly do not. DarkGlow I think hates me, for one." She sighs, "I can't blame anyone. I hate your father for the exact reason. I am sad to say it, but people who can do what I can should not exist. We violate the last free world that exists."

"That's bullshit," says Tom, with a frown. "And you know it. When you are on the street, that's one thing. But when you step into a position of power, you have lost some of your right to privacy. It has to be that way, or else society collapses very quickly. The people who enforce order cannot have the same order enforced on them. They have to answer to a higher authority."

"What right do I have to be that authority?" asks Ming. "Who on earth would want to be? And if they did, would you ever want them to be? Do you really trust me, Thomas? You don't have much of a choice, I suppose, do you."

"You're right, I don't," he smiles. "So, I do trust you. But if you do not have the right, then who does?"

"No one has the right," answers Ming. "No one is up to the task, in any case." She sighs, tapping the wall, "I owe it to her, though. As in all things."

Thomas nods, then begins leading the way out of the apartment complex again. He speaks again as he holds the front door open. "You can help make a better world for your younger sister to grow up in," he says. "You can do something that will make her life better, in all ways."

"I do, but that is not directly what I meant," replies Ming. She departs the apartment complex eagerly, quite pleased to avoid any potential confrontation.

Ming smiles strangely as she goes on, "I was referring to my mother. She and my father molded me into what I am, and now that my sister is alone I must be everything to her in their place. Mother, father, and guardian. What we will do is part of this. It is the part I am not so likely to enjoy, but it is important."

Thomas nods slowly, as he walks toward the car. "I think when someone smiles at you and says 'Thank you for what you have done for me', you will understand the enjoyment I get from this job."

Ming just opens the car door, unlocking Thomas' side in silence. "I'll need a call name of some kind," she says softly. With a groan the engine comes to life. "You mind if I play some music? Trying to improve my mood. You'd think I'd be happier, finally get to chase my great obsession. I guess I get to track my own actions now."

In answer, Tom begins to tap his fingers against the dash. It's slow at first, but each fingertip that brushes over the dash sounds uncannily like a drum-beat. He begins using more fingers, steadily building up an arsenal of invisible instruments on Ming's dashboard as he plays. "Come on, join in if you like," he suggests, then opens his mouth again. Rather than words, the sweet sound of a jazz sax begin to fill the car, as Tom's power turns the air of the vehicle's interior into an ensemble.

Ming raises an eyebrow. For a moment, she just listens, finally allowing a small smile to come to her lips. For the rest of the trip she sings, using her real voice to mingle with Thomas' unexpected music. Very slowly she starts to allow herself to feel better, not worrying anymore about the broken team she has landed herself in.

The song continues, and winds down, as all music must. Tom holds up a finger, getting Ming's attention. He holds his nose and begins twisting, as though tuning it. The sound of radio static fills the car, finally settling on a slow and classical waltz. From his his head, Tom plucks a few hairs, then arranges them carefully in his open palm. They stand upright of their own accord, shaping themselves into a pair of miniature, stick-thin humanoid figures, and as the music progresses they join "limbs" and begin dancing.

Ming watches Thomas and shakes her head. (( You don't seem to be enjoying yourself. )) She focuses on the road, of course, but occasionally checks to see what odd things Thomas is up to.

Thomas chuckles, breaking the waltz music off abruptly. The dancing figures, too, fall into his palm as merely inanimate strands of hair. "I was rather hoping you'd be enjoying it," he comments.

Ming smiles. (( I was, but.. something in me likes to resist any attempts at relaxing and having a good time. I've been cooped-up a long time, Thomas. )) She sighs, letting random thoughts flit down her link. (( Must be nice to be young. ))

Thomas hmmms softly. (( Young in some ways, old in others, )) he transmits silently. (( Forgive me if I seem tentative.. I'm not used to telepathy except for cursing one particular person out... ))

(( You think I use this often? )) She's amused. (( It's tempting, I'll admit, but talking is more personal and polite, normally. )) Ming sighs softly, navigating the way back without having to pay much mind. (( I hate traffic. ))

Thomas nods slowly. "I prefer subterranean travel myself, but I don't think I can really recommend it to you," he replies with a smile.

(( I suppose not. )) Ming taps on the steering wheel and sighs. (( Jiao won't be home tonight. She's staying over at a friend's house for a birthday party. It's so damn quiet. That's part of the reason I invited you, honestly. Pretty sad, huh? ))

"What, you want me to hang out?" Tom sounds sort of surprised by this. "Why me?"

Ming laughs softly. (( Have you ever seen me walk across campus, Thomas? )) she asks. Images of her walking flit through the link. In almost all of them she's alone. (( There is no one else, I'm afraid. I'm 23, I have no friends among the faculty, just colleagues. ))

"Well, uh..." Tom shrugs a little. "Sure, we can hang out." He smiles. "I have some good friends. But, nobody I really trust, y'know? Like, even my girlfriend has no idea about what I do. I trust her, and I would tell her, but she'd be in danger, I think. But you are different."

Ming nods. (( I guess I am. )) She's obviously not sure if that's a good or bad thing at this point. (( It's kind of pitiful, huh? A teacher who bribes a student over cause she's lonely and bored. ))

"Well, hey, I haven't actually been bribed with anything," points out Tom with a smile. "It's just sort of weird, you know? But sure, I'll hang out."

Ming laughs softly. (( I guess it is weird. )) She drives the rest of the way in silence, lost in thought, apparently.
