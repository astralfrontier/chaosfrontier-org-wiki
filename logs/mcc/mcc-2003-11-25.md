# Millennium City Chronicles 2003-11-25

Sirens get closer. As the crowd disburses though, something catches the eyes of the team; the private eye spots heads turning as a group to follow someone. Ming sees someone duck behind an escalator, but DarkGlow sees it for what it is: someone who looks like him, running.

Ming hmmss, studying the shape, but not really knowing it is. In this big of a mess, she rather doubts there's time. "I think someone else has the right idea, too. We had better get out of here, right?" she says to Ghost Knight.

Thomas turns, trying to ascertain context for a moment. **Yes..** But he makes no move, spending a second to try and determine what the others are looking at.

DarkGlow's widen as he comes to an abrupt halt. He shoots a quick, sidelong look at Ambiance. _Uh... when it rains, it pours...?_ He feels the fleeing shadow in his mind, and comes to a decision he doesn't really want to come to. "I'll... uh, I'll be back in a while. Ambiance..." _Crap, crap, crap..._ "I'll leave you in my companions' care." He moves forward a step, in the direction the figure ran. "Guy, I think, can point you at a decent place to eat." He steps forward again, trying to localize a place to jump to catch up with the figure.

GK looks curiously after the fleeing figure, then comes to a decision instantly as DarkGlow teleports out. _Too many unanswered questions..._ He's off as well, commanding **Come!** to the others behind him as he races.

Ming shrugs at Thomas, looks more than a bit curious right now. She just runs a hand through her hair, wondering what it was that Dark Glow saw, anyway. And then Ghost Knight is off to run. Sigh. Oh well, she'll run, too!

The shadow manipulator reammerges from the weak shadow from a store's harsh lighting. Across from him is a man, skin far too pale, hair bobbed short in an executive cut. He looks pulled out of an office building. After a moment of what looks like nervousness gripping the individual, he looks around. "Oh shit. They're coming," He says out loud, peering across the way as Ghost Knight and the others move through the parting crowd.

Guy simply steps between ticks of the clock, moving from one place to the other quite literally in the blink of an eye. After all, it wouldn't do well to be caught just yet. Or... ever really. He stops, appearing just outside the mall, radioing to the others, "Where're we off to then?"

**There are at least two cognates of DarkGlow. There may be more,** replies the Ghost crisply into the radio. **Above all we must collect them all and keep them safe.**

Over the radio, just before he teleports back inside, Guy radios "Oh wait. Okay so we're not fleeing the scene." _Collect the alternate universe DG... I swear if we have to catch 'em all, I'm going to scream_ He runs back into the mall, taking a moment to catch up to everyone. "So... which way?"

Fading to invisibility, DarkGlow thinks rapidly about what he wants to do. _If he teleports somewhere and he's like Ambiance--or how Ambiance probably is--I may not be able to follow. So do I just take him down? This is a **hell** of a time for it to start raining doubles..._ He feels the weak texture of the shadows about him. _And there's nothing like dealing from a position of strength. Maybe I should try diplomacy--minus the gunboat-- before I possibly get my ass handed to me..._ Mentally shrugging, and keeping what grip he can on the shadows in case it gets ugly, DarkGlow steps forward. "If you're confused as to what's going on, please let me explain."

The other DarkGlow looks up, and blinks a minute. He just stares across at the shadow manipulator with a mix of emotions too thick to pick out individually. A glance to the onrushing individuals, before back to the original. "... better start."

Ming is going to stop her chase at a reasonable difference. Somewhere nearby, but not too close. She can at least do her mental thumping from here if it is needed. (( So.. just how many of these are there? )) she projects over the link.

Thomas shrugs mentally. (( It remains to be seen. Keep alert. ))

(( Well if memory serves the theory states there's an infinite number of alternate realities. Given that each and every decision we make has all possible choices taken throughout reality, if you buy into that mumbo jumbo. Me, I'm gonna hope this is the last guy. )) Thinks Guy, although he's not quite sure he believes himself. He looks around, (( So what happens after we catch these guys? Should we be worried about destroying all of time and space? ))

"They're friends," DarkGlow replies, with a nod at the others. _Blast, can't they leave me alone for a minute? Then again, they're not grilling Ambiance..._ "An invention got stolen here which can bring things from different dimensions here. I got hit with the damn thing while we tried to get it back, and you showed up. You're my duplicate or whatever you want to call it in your world. Me, I think one's enough for this world and I figure you're gonna get homesick pretty quick. So what say you help us get the gizmo back?" He notes abstractly that his speech has quickened by the end, prodded by the undoubtedly imminent arrival of the others. He raises a hand to wave them back, but keeps his eyes on his second double.

(( Little late to worry, and pointless until we know how to do something about it. That idiot Blake would have to find something this dangerous. )) Ming sighs softly, looking for Ambiance. Hopefully he's kept up? If not, she'll go latch onto him before he runs off somewhere.

The other man processes this information with a tight face. However, as DarkGlow ends the little explination, a quick shake of his head. "I don't... no, that's okay." The crowd is certainly moving now as the police start jogging to the screne.

The Ghost steps forward, all business in his bearing. **This is not the time. We must evacuate. Now.**

Ambiance is waiting with a funny smile on his face. Instead, the white-bedecked double moves between Ghost Knight and Ming. His mouth opens, but as the police approach and the vigilante's unearthly voice is offered forth, he closes his mouth.

DarkGlow glances quickly at the cops, and resists frowning at GhostKnight. "They're rather annoying here, too. Come with us. Please?"

One look at the police earn a nod from the double. "Sure, I'm fine with that." He moves towards the rest of the team. "Hey!" Calls one of the police, "Stop!"

Ming sighs softly. (( Great. Just great. Just what I need, trouble with the police. ))

"And that is our cue to exit, stage left," muses Guy, as the police officer calls out. He shakes his head, "Let's go..."

**Guy, take Ming. DarkGlow, escort your doubles. I'll handle this,** suggests the Ghost, then turns, arm outstretched, fingers splayed in a harsh gesture of command. By his will, the very air of the mall begins to solidify, the moisture freezing solid into sheets of ice that block the way.

DarkGlow nods rapidly, backs towards the storefront shadow. "Right. Good. GhostKnight can get you away quickly--" He stares at the sheets of ice. "Uh, I doubt they can follow me. Ambiance certainly looks like he can't. I was hoping you'd do your sink-into-the-earth trick with 'em and we'd all head to the warehouse...?"

Guy grabs hold of Ming at GK's insistance, (( Nothing personal, I just have to be holding onto you, and this is the quickest way out of here. You might wanna close your eyes here... )) And then Guy once again slips between ticks of the clocks, teleporting away from the crowded mall, headed for the more familiar areas of town. Namely the warehouse.

Thomas nods slowly. **I'll take care of it then.**

Something pulls DarkGlow's eyes like a beacon, as though he knew something was there when he looked, a presence. Staring across the mall, in the shadow beneath the escalator. stands a woman. Her dress is a black business suit, the shirt beneath a stark white, contrasting with the tie. The compliment it pays her pale, far to pale skin is lost to him, as is the hair so white, tinged with streaks of silver. It is lost because the eyes, his eyes, stare back at him. A feeling like a comfortable breeze soothes across him with the sound of silk against silk in the background building towards words. Then a chilled wind rides up his body. The angry hissing, the cold rush of the phantom lashes through his form, and with a frown, the woman is lost to DarkGlow's eyes, the spot empty to him.

Ming lets Guy lead the way. She keeps her eyes open for a bit, then shuts them. (( Ugh, dizzy )) is about all she can manage.

DarkGlow locks his knees to stop himself from falling. Slowly, limbs numb as from the essence of winter so briefly revealed, his gloved hand comes up and pulls down his hood. The shadows covering his face fade as if they never were. Eyes--too pale, but matching his face and hair--stare frozen at the spot where she stood. Where _she_ stood. "Oh, no..." he whispers. The feeling of numbness is gone like a layer of ice shattering, and he steps backwards. And again. "I'm..." He almost falls, quickly recovers. "I've gotta..." He stares around at he others, his expression like a lost boy's. He opens his mouth but nothing more emerges. He spins, and dives into shadow.

The warehouse is still. Lydon is pacing, though there is an odd, almost pleased expression on his face. Shawtae's leaning back in a comfy leather chair, watching with an amused expression as Ambiance and the so-far unnamed dimensional relative of DarkGlow stare at one another across the room.

**Privacy is important to many,** begins GK, neutrally. **Nevertheless it may aid us if we understood something about both of you. Please speak as plainly as you feel comfortable.**

DarkGlow stands, arms folded, radiating anger like heat. "I'm thinking that would be a touch intrusive, the life stories of the rest of us here being what they are. I think a brief summary of their experiences just prior to their arrival would be most relavent."

(( You guys sure don't get along very well for a super hero team )) suggests Ming along the link. She sighs inwardly and suggests, "I'm not quite sure what exactly you are worried about, since these two come from totally alternate worlds."

Guy nods, "Yeah well calm down everyone. Look we don't need to have everyone's life story, but it might be nice to know a little bit about each of you, so we know what we're dealing with, as well as DG's suggestion here. I think a sort of best of both... oer... all three, worlds, y'know?"

(( There is much fear, and many secrets, in our midst. That which makes us so effective in our niche - mystery, danger, apprehension - also keeps us apart. It is the way of things. )) The Ghost Knight's mental voice is tinged with a hint of sadness, wrapped in a steely resolve - these are how things are, and he accepts them.

The two alternates look to their shadowy kin. Ambiance begins. "I was speaking to some children. I understand how hard it is as ... I seek to be a role model. I was just going home to check with some who know things. I've been dealing with a vicious group of powered individuals, and I have been parlaying with the shadier types to find out who, what, when and where. Then I was pulled here."

(( That's not good enough for me )) Ming answers softly. (( And I rather doubt not trusting each other helps you. I can't even put a link to everyone in the team because of that 'strength' of yours. )) Disappointment rolls down the link as Ming sends her thoughts. So much for the high esteem of the group in this fangirl's eyes.

"I was taking a break from work," replies the other duplicate. "I'm a computer technician at Skynet Industries - I view the networks and fix any problems, as well as do some coding when need be." He sideglances to DarkGlow, before continuing. "I glanced at the news, and was shaking my head about something about a bombing, and then I was in the midst of some costumed guys - you, and there was a fight. I bolted."

DarkGlow broods, barely listening, unfocussed rage pricking at him. _It wasn't her. It was almost her, but no. She doesn't have white hair and the other does. And the eyes... I think they're different, too. But..._ His heart still thuds in his chest like it was on an adreneline high. _Another of my duplicates? Me as female? That'd be a laugh._ Thoughts of NightStar are too close not to tinge the image. _Yeah, a real killing joke._

(( Well one of these days we're going to have a 'very special episode' and then all the secrets will be out on the table, and then where will we be. Trusting each other. Gah. My socks are too hot. )) Guy blinks at Dark Glow, wondering, "So... uh... anyone else?"

**The points of commonality are obvious. In the observed cases, only the 'local' person was hit with the weapon's effects,** points out GK. **Duplicates of each person were drawn through space and dimension; it was not necessary for them to be located in similar locations. Thus, a return should be equally easy to effect, provided we can obtain the weapon.**

The computer technician looks from DarkGlow back to the others. "Well, since some of us don't want us to say names... then what should you call me? 'You there' doesn't quite work."

DarkGlow senses Guy's regard and looks at him from beneath a restored hood and shadow-chased face. He looks to GhostKnight as the other speaks, and finally to the computer tech version of himself. "I'm Daniel. I imagine you are as well."

Ming sits herself down, 'listening' along the link for now. She'll stir after a moment and pull out her PDA. Along the link, there's a sense of concentration as she writes things out. Ideas for a super hero name and costume, it would seem. There's still a fair amount of annoyance broiling down the link, as well.

The relatively normal man blinks. "Okay. Call me Dan then, to make some distinction."

DarkGlow shrugs. "It's a rusty, unused name for me. Use Daniel, if you prefer. I go by DarkGlow, and nothing else." _How easily that came out--as easily as dying._ His pulse is still too rapid. He tries calming himself down, fails.

Lydon turns to the Ghost Knight. "Well, I did appear above a roof... and that was an unpleasant surprise. So the two duplicates may trade places. But I don't know how it works when the two enter the same world."

_Three,_ DarkGlow adds silently. _I think. I used to wish for family to visit. Now I just want them to all go away...._

Thomas nods slowly. **Our first priority is the device. All else will follow from that. Dan. Ambiance. Cooperate with us for fastest results.** He offers a gloved hand.

A desire deep inside the shadow manipulator for removing the third duplicate all otgether springs forth. An uneasiness, a threat to him. _... Daniel._ The words echo in DarkGlow's mind, the feeling of cold on his spine. The room is dimmer to his eyes, and not from his powers.

Ming hmmss quietly. "I suppose no one has a good idea of just where the device is now," she muses. "We can't even be sure who has it anymore."

Ambiance reaches forward to clap his hand with the knight. Daniel however lingers back. "What makes you think I ... even have powers of my own? I mean, we're different people even though we're similar. I could be completely normal."

**'Normal' is not 'ineffective',** points out GK. **All of us have useful talents. All of us have a purpose and a place.**

"And I like to think my purpose is staying out of this sort've thing," Daniel replies warily.

DarkGlow shakes off the feeling, but his thoughts move slowly, as if through clotted blood. He laughs, but the sound is wrong. "Didn't you ever want to be a hero?"

"So does that mean you are finally going to let me make a link with you, Darg Glow?" asks Ming. She won't get her hopes up. To Daniel, she says, "But it's a lot of fun, and it's not like you have anything better to do, right?"

Guy nods, "Well now, that's better. And my head doesn't feel like it's going to explode anymore either, which is always a plus. So lemme ask you guys this... what do you think's going to happen back in your respective universes?"

Daniel snorts. "Right, right. Risk my well being simply because I can? If I wanted to do that, I'd buy a fast car and drag race."

Ambiance simply remains quiet, watching Daniel with piercing eyes. Though his attention shifts towards Guy. "Without us in it, you mean?"

Guy nods, "Yeah, without you guys in it."

Shadows flicker between Ming and DarkGlow, ominously. It'll have to do for an answer--DarkGlow's thoughts are elsewhere. _**Hero**_, he sneers to himself. _Blood and violence and lives past counting. Hero, indeed._ An image appears in his mind of a figure of white, slashed with dripping red. It vanishes before he can see it's face.

Ming sighs softly. "Figures." She will just use her PDA to check her main computer for any kind of strange super hero activity in the past hour. Besides the mall, that is!

"I'd figure the world would keep turning," Shawntae tosses out. "I'm more worried about what's going to happen in this world. I mean, with all these alternate people coming into this world, won't it harm our space-time-something or other? I mean, the first rule of time/dimensional travel is that you can't exist in the same space as yourself."

Guy says, "Now that's funny. See, I always thought the first rule of time/dimensional travel was... 'don't think about it too hard or your head will explode.' Maybe that's just me."

**The first rule is that physicists don't study in movie theaters,** responds the Ghost gruffly. **Let us consider how to proceed.**

Ming snorts and checks the system, then checks for email from Blake. That useless, good for nothing hack idiot ought to do something of use.

"All right then." Lydon perches on the end of a table. "The first thing we should do is find out how to get to Foxbat, or Chesire Cat, or whoever might have the device."

Ming keeps busy. On a random note, she looks through her chemistry database, seeing if there is a frequency at which zirconium would resonate.

The PDA reports that a few activities are showing up. Tsunami, a hero associated with San Francisco, was spotted touching down outside of Homestead, the Champs' base. Preperations for Detroit Day are steadily underway. Blake left a small note that he's almost finished with a prototype to find displacements in the dimensional rift. Namely the duplicates.

Ming hmms. She sends the info along the link as she speaks, "Looks like our friend is making a little progress." She talks to herself aloud, "Ahh, 9.3298 MHz is the resonance frequency for zirconium. Interesting."

Ming looks to Ghost Knight, "Do you think we could get a magnetic pulse generator? I have been thinking of something.. oh, and some kind of wave collector, as well would be needed."

Thomas simply points a gloved finger in Lydon's direction.

Ming looks to Lydon, "So..?" she puts to him. "You want to try something a bit weird?"

"So uhm... hmmm. What if instead we set a trap for these guys? I mean if we know GRAB is on the job, and that Foxbat is their uh... nemesis," Guy cannot keep a straight face, but continues, "Maybe we can snare the weapon and the guy at once?"

Thomas then turns his attention to 'Dan'. **It is not necessary that you be a hero,** he says. **Recovering the device may prove dangerous. However, consider this your opportunity to at least observe what might have been, and what might still be, for you. DarkGlow is a hero; he has aided this team when it needed him. He has been a benefit to those around him, and not only because he used his powers.**

Lydon leans back with consideration. "Well... we did do some work with magnetic pulse a few months ago, last I checked with some of my technicians. I'll have to see if it's still with us." He grins. "Weird? Sure."

Dan looks from DarkGlow back to Thomas. "I would think the bright one would be better to look to. He's not sulking." Though he still doesn't appear pleased or even wanting to consider the Ghost Knight's words.

Ming claps her hands together and hops to her feet, rushing over to Lydon. She looks around, then just starts writing on her PDA screen. "Tell me if I go too fast," she says. And then she just starts working, writing out a very general design for a machine to first send out an extremely potent pulse, and then for a collector to search for resonance waves at the frequency of zirconium. As she goes, she moves faster and faster unless told to slow down. She's not as fast as Thomas, but he might be the only one who can crunch her equations with ease.

Still stung from GhostKnight's words, DarkGlow lashes at Dan. "I would dearly love a nice, normal nine-to-five as a computer tech, a wife, two kids and the parents over on the weekends for a barbeque." A shadow rips the air like a whip, then settles back in a credible imitation of a hissing serpent. The anger flows out of him as he watches the serpent sway. "Child's tricks," he whispers. "That's all they were supposed to be..."

Lydon seems to keep up with Ming, never stopping her. "Impressive," He returns while looking over her shoulder. "It seems like this team is a constant stream of people with the potential to work for me." The CEO shoots a glance Ghost Knight-wards.

Daniel shrinks back from the shadow, while Ambiance lets loose a sigh. "So, Dan," Shawntae pipes up. "Since you're not busy..." The cyberkinetic starts the two down a technical conversation about networking. Shawntae's classes are starting to pay off.

"Now there's an interesting equation right there. I'm not quite sure I understand what the exponential multiplication is for, though I imagine it has something to do with the resonance frequency. Or I could just be making this stuff up." Guy gives a rather interesting grin. He looks at the alternate universe DG's. "Well then, uh, with any luck we'll have you guys back ina jiffy."

Ming laughs sofly at Guy. "Something like that. I have a feeling we'll need to tell the authorities we're doing this. They might get a bit angry otherwise. This will be quite a pulse." She is very eager to give this a try, actually.
