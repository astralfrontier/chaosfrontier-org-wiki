# Millennium City Chronicles 2003-11-29

Work progresses on the tracking device; Shawntae has called, reporting that final parts should be arriving via UPS by the end of the afternoon. Thomas nods, giving thanks in his crypt-like voice via the radio, then begins opening other packages. On the floor of Ming's living room, he begins laying out the contents of the boxes - para-aramid weave, the successors of Kevlar, along with numerous dyes, paints and other things, including a carefully wrapped collection of ceramic inserts. "Alright," he says to his professor, "tell me what you want."

Ming watches Thomas curiously. "This is really amazing," she says with a grin. "Well, I was thinking something, you know, super heroine-esque? I want to use the name of Clarity, and I'd like the costume to be a bluish white, like ice."

Ming steps forward, tilting her head, "I was thinking two parts, really. I'd like a body suit and over that I'd wear a rather formal outfit. A suit top with a skirt. I'd like it to be cut for ease of motion. Oh, remind me to get some good, high-quality shades, too."

Thomas nods, thinking for a few moments. He stretches out his hand, narrowing his eyes for a moment and wielding his powers of concentration. The armor rises from its resting place, animated by will alone, rising into the air. Segments of it are sheared off as though cut by invisible scissors. Slowly the armor wraps itself about to form a general outline. "Come into my mind. Guide the image in my head, and the physical suit will follow," he suggests softly.

Ming nods, though her head doesn't move. Thomas can simply feel it. (( I will try to control stray thoughts. )) Then images are offered, and this time she adds a mask of careful craft, a design carved into its surface that means nothing at first, but grows in detail. Equations of physics and various chemical equations are etched into the mask, and where her eyes will be there are openings left to be filled later, with more appropriate materials. (( It's strange, I know, but somehow it fits me well. Or I hope it will. )) The body suit is designed to be tight, and rather immodest. Fortunately it serves as little more than protective underclothing. She maintains her concentration, trying to guide Thomas with the pictures in her mind.

Thomas moves the materials to fit his mental image, gesturing with his fingers and rotating the whole costume in the air from time to time. (( Mind, body, spirit, )) he thinks openly. (( Power comes when these are united. This is not your power, but you can tap it when my mind allows it. )) He watches the process impassively, adding his own adjustments here and there as he draws upon his own memories and experiences of wearing body armor into real combat.

Ming watches the subtle changes both in her mind and secondly through her eyes. (( I never imagined you knew so many things. I never thought you could have such a different life. )) She continues to guide with her images, adding an afterthought. (( I never thought my powers would prove useful. ))

Thomas chuckles softly. (( And my powers have never been used to cure another human being, yet yours permitted that. You made me a gift, and I appreciate it. This is small repayment indeed. )) He gestures firmly, closing off the last of the seams of the undergarment, and slowly it floats to the couch nearby. "Alright. You want to go fit it, while I relax for a minute?" he asks.

Ming nods, picking up her new costume and grinning. (( I'm going to feel so absurd. How do you get used to wearing these things? )) She wanders into the next room and begins to change. She's careful to quiet down the link just before Thomas would get to know far more about his professor than he wants to. Within a few minutes the link returns and Ming is studying herself in the bodysuit in the mirror. This she does pass along the link, with careful omissions. (( It's a comfortable fit. I guess I really do like tight clothes. )) Then she slips on the suit top and the skirt, stepping back out so Thomas can see with his own eyes. The mask she offers to him, "If you wouldn't mind, I'd like you to put this on me."

Thomas nods slowly, getting up from the chair he was lounging in, and taking the mask. Carefully he aligns it on his teacher's head, frowning a little. "The idea is to obscure your features, while not obscuring your senses," he remarks. "You need to be able to see and hear and feel as much of what's going on around you as you can."

(( I can see myself through your eyes if you let me, or smell what you smell, or even feel what you feel. )) Ming smiles inside, adding a playful bit. (( Though I will try to keep the embarassing things from spilling down the link. Like the adoration I feel for you since you helped my sister. You know, little things like that. ))

Thomas chuckles softly. "Fear is a useful weapon," he says, in a thoughful tone. "But it's not how I always want to be remembered.." He sits down again, breathing for awhile and relaxing. "Get changed out again, and we can put on the dyes and such.. as long as you're comfortable with the fit, that is."

Ming nods and steps back to the room to change again. (( Now no peeking, okay? )) she teases along the link. (( Oh, and I hope you've found time to get your homework done. I'll be calling on you in class, you know. )) She again changes, setting aside her costume with care. For a moment, there's a strange emotion pouring over the link that is hard to put a finger on. Part joy, part sorrow, part excitement. (( I'm not entirely sure, but maybe part of me has always wished for a day when I would become a hero. Say, you ever going to give me a proper autograph? ))

Thomas laughs softly. (( I'll make you a deal. I'll stitch 'made by the Ghost Knight' on the inside of your armor, a week or two after your secret ID is known to the papers. That should keep its distribution down. How about it? ))

(( I'm only asking for you to write Ghost Knight on a piece of paper! )) replies Ming. There's more than a little exasperation on the link. (( Well, I suppose I have something even better, since I get to keep copies of your research papers. Real work of the Ghost Knight is right in my filing cabinet! )) She's truly hopeless.

(( Right, so what do you need my name for, then? )) Thomas asks with levity in his mental 'voice'. Deep down, the same mistrust lingers, the paranoia that has preserved his life and identity thus far. (( You done in there yet? ))

For just a second, a teasing image of her half-dressed flashes and is gone. She walks out a moment later. (( Sometimes I just can't help myself! I like to collect autographs of super heroes. It's more than just a small hobby. It's.. I don't know, a piece of history. Maybe I can get a lot more signatures after I do things that are important. Nobody seems to recognize scientists these days. ))

Thomas smiles. "Well, what do you expect? Sure, science gave us television, lasers, and orbiting satellites. But popular culture takes celebrities, Britney Spears music CDs, and pagers from that. You might build the road, but the common man drives the car, and that's where his attention lies."

"I guess that is true," admits Ming. "But it'd be nice if we'd occasionally be noticed, too. You know, when we aren't doing something awful." She sets herself down on the couch, "So, where do we get the color work done? Oh, and I'll need matching lip stick, just for completion's sake. And dye for my hair, I think."

"You'll get noticed in THAT outfit," remarks Tom with a hint of a smirk. "Anyway, we get it done right here. Just direct me again, okay?" He lifts cans of paint into the air, cracking open their lids, directing the paint inside to form levitating spheres of color. The completed costume floats between them, waiting. "You know what to do."

(( I guess I do. )) Ming guides Thomas, uniting color with costume in her mind and then watching it become reality. (( This is kinda cool, isn't it? You really think I'll get noticed? I'd rather like that. )) More than a touch of embarassment over that admission flows along the link. (( I never really had the whole social queen thing going for me in highschool. )) Which is to be expected, considering her age at the time.

Thomas smiles gently, saying nothing as he works. The last of the coloration is applied, and Thomas blows on a sudden burst of controlled wind, focused neatly around the costume and not so much as ruffling a strand of his hair. The pigmentation dries in no time, and he sets the completed outfit down on the couch again, carefully. "That takes a lot out of me," he remarks, breathing somewhat quicker than before.

Ming grins widely, examining the outfit, "It's amazing! You do grea-" And then there's the sound of the lock on her door working. "Oh dear," murmurs Ming. "She said she was going to a friend's house after school.." For a moment Ming panics, then she looks to the suit. "We need to hide this, quick!" she says. And that's about the time the door swings open and in walks Ming's sister. With a friend along for good measure.

In a flash Thomas is moving, leaping for the couch. His hand smacks down on the costume, pushing it bodily through the couch and behind. He withdraws his hand from the solid matter of the sofa quickly, hoping he properly angled his body to obscure the maneuver.. All that one can see, should they look at him, is a college student lazily slacking on his professor's couch.

Ming shifts on the couch, letting out a sigh inside. Then again, this is only the start of the craziness. Jiaojung beams once she sees Thomas, but remembers that she's not supposed to say much. "Hello Bigsis!" she calls out cheerily, half-bouncing over to give her older sister a peck on the cheek. The relationship is clearly more like that of a mother and a daughter with these two. Which is how Ming likes it, judging by the emotions sent over the link. "I didn't think you were coming home today, change of plans?" asks Ming. Jiaojung nods, "Yeah, Sarah forgot her key and is locked-out until later, so we decided to come here. I hope we didn't disrupt anything? Are you guys going out, or just hanging around here?" Jiaojung is more than a bit curious.

Thomas blinks in surprise. "Going out? What? No, uh, I just came over for a consultation," he mumbles, turning his head. Oh yeah, consultation on super ARMOR DESIGN.

"Wow, your sister's boyfriend is a hunk," whispers Sarah to Jiaojung. (( Oh my, I think this is way beyond control at this point. )) Jiaojung grins at Thomas impishly, "Sure you did. You two shouldn't be so shy! I'm glad you are happy, bigsis." Ming can only blush and laugh inside. (( Well, I guess this is better than the truth. I can always set things straight later, right? )) Jiaojung just goes on, "We'll just go to my room. You can have your date and pretend we aren't even here." Without allowing any further chances for protest, she suits her words, heading to her room with Sarah in tow.

Thomas breathes out a sigh of relief, withdrawing the costume from its hiding place behind the couch. "You're gonna need a place to hide this," he remarks. "A good, secure place, where NOBODY is gonna look."

"I will think of something, probably a secure locker made of lead with a good padlock," says Ming softly. (( It's how I keep all my research papers hidden, this seems to fit in with those. )) She laughs softly, "So now I've got to convince her that I don't really have a boyfriend. She'll be rather disappointed, I imagine."

Thomas taps his chin. "Should be easy," he comments. "Get a girlfriend?"

Ming blinks in surprise, "Very funny, Thomas." She snorts at him, "You are really quite difficult. I'm afraid your suggestion isn't quite workable."

"Well," muses Tom, "I could invite my girlfriend over to meet you and your sister. That'd certainly dispel any such notions pretty quickly. Sure, I'd have to explain things to Chris, but she's very understanding." He smiles a little, looking guilty for a few moments. "I gotta tell her sooner or later about me, I think. Sooner would be better."

(( Maybe I could help with that a bit? I imagine she might kinda flip out over it. Hmm, you know, I don't know if I've met your girlfriend. I'm guessing she's not like.. us? )) Ming does some talking, to keep up appearances, just in case. "I think in a way Jiaojung will be happy to know I'm not going out with you. She kinda was hoping she'd have you for herself, after all."

Thomas nearly falls off the couch. "She what?" he stumbles. Carefully he crawls his way back towards his seat, and a hint of composure. (( Like us? She has no power, if that's what you mean. It's a major stumbling block in our relationship, since my father doesn't approve. ))

(( Your father is an asshole. )) Ming is giggling inside. (( Sorry, but that felt very good. )) "Of course she adores you. She remembers what you did, even if we never talk about it, save to whisper occasionally. I think she would burst otherwise."

Thomas frowns. "Well, I didn't really do anything, officially," he mumbles. Rubbing his head, he lets out a long sigh. "Seems like nobody is ever happy with my choice of romantic partners, eh?"

"I wouldn't know," says Ming. "On the bright side, at least you have some? Trust me, the prospects among the faculty aren't exactly promising." She laughs softly and sighs. "Oh well, I already have all the good things a relationship can bring just by getting to take care of my sister."

Thomas nods slowly. "I guess that's what's important. But hey, I doubt the faculty is your only range of choices. I have a um, sort of tournament thing coming up. Detroit Day. Lots of powerful people, so to speak. Feel like coming along?"

"A tournament?" asks Ming. "I suppose I could go. And what do you mean by powerfu people? I generally don't get on well with politicians. I have trust issues with those types. Always seem to turn out to be liars and thieves, you know?"

Thomas coughs. "Other power," he remarks discreetly, tapping his own forehead. "It's a uh, sort of challenge deal. Sort of an arena thing. I doubt you'd want to participate, but you probably would love to be there."

"Ugh, like a power olympics?" suggests Ming. The idea clearly doesn't make her very happy. (( Isn't there enough danger in the world without beating the hell out of each other for sport? Why on earth are you going there? ))

(( It's for charity, called Building Bridges, )) Tom replies. (( You know, now that I'm not on the 'arrest on sight' list down at City Hall, I might be able to do good for more than just your sister. ))

(( If you need my help, feel free to ask anytime. I'd like to do something really good, rather than fail to break-up robberies and demonstrate my general lack of interrogation and deductive skills at crime scenes. )) She lets out a soft sigh. "It'd be nice if I could find more ways to help. I really do want to be an asset."

Thomas laughs a little. "I know a thousand ways you could be helpful. Trust me. Of course most of them involve reading bank account numbers and dirty secrets from the minds of powerful big-shots, so we can expose them."

(( I imagine things should be kinda quiet on Detroit Day. With that many supers, I wouldn't steal candy for fear of bumping into a hero, if I were a criminal. )) Ming lets her mind wander a bit. (( Then again, there will be lots of powers there, I bet. Maybe some will be nice and autograph my book for me.. )) Ghost Knight can look forward to being the guy who brought 'Ms. Autograph' along.

Thomas nods. "Yeah, pretty much." He smiles broadly. "Interested, then?"

"I suppose it will be fun. I'll try not to embarass you, Thomas, but you know how I am about these things," she says softly. Ming can't help but be a bit excited. (( Umm, are they going to want to know what my powers are? I'm guessing it's a fairly exclusive group, huh? ))

Thomas chuckles. (( Exclusive in one sense, at least. Powered people or at least very capable people. As for powers and discretion... use your best judgement ))

(( But should I go as Clarity, or as myself? )) asks Ming. She seems a bit uncertain. (( How should I act as Clarity, anyway? You seem so different when you are.. you know, umm, on stage. )) She's even squeamish about revealing his real identity on her 'private line'.

Thomas smiles. (( Well, I act different, but it's easy for me. Umm, everything that the Ghost Knight does is designed to convey a single impression. )) Tom tries to summarize easily what he has spent a year honing. (( The Ghost Knight is a revenant, an angel of death, who preys on the guilty and avenges the innocent. That's the core of his being. So... you must clearly understand what Clarity is, what Clarity was meant for, what her um, I guess 'destiny' or 'fate' is. And everything you do should be an expression of that. ))

(( Right. )) She clearly has no idea how to do any of those things. (( I haven't a clue what Clarity is really about, I guess. It's kind of like acting, I suppose. I'll have to come up with something. At least the costume is cool. I'm really grateful for it! ))

Thomas nods slowly. (( Before you go out in it, before you do anything, decide what it is Clarity must do in this world. Then you will be set. ))

There's a little giggle as Sarah and Jiaojung peek out. "Isn't it cute how they are just staring at each other like that and not saying anything?" whispers Sarah. "I told you it's all about the expression and the eyes. That's love, right?" suggests Jiaojung. With wide grins the two dart away, not even taking note of the costume that Ming has set behind her. (( Maybe we should go out somewhere? She's not usually like this, Thomas, I assure you. She's very well behaved, but.. she's excited. Probably for me, in all honesty. When she wants something to be true, it just is for a while, you know? ))

Thomas thinks. "Oh, I think I can give her something far more exciting to think about," he murmurs after a moment, rising to his feet. Casually he withdraws three pencils from his backpack, sitting on the floor by the sofa, and holds them between his hands, behind his back, as he strolls towards the door of Ming's younger sister. He taps on the door after a moment, keeping the pencils concealed behind his back with one hand. "I'm told there's a Princess Jiaojung in this castle," he says in a light-hearted voice.

Jiaojung is speaking with Sarah in hushed tones as the door swings open. Ming's sister looks up with a smile, "Hello, Ming's Boyfriend. Who told you I was a princess?" She watches Thomas very curiously, but keeps smiling.

"Why, Queen Tiaoning," replies Tom with a gallant smile. He manipulates something behind his back, then offers his left fist, uncurling the fingers and revealing the palm up, along with what's inside - a diamond, precious and sparkling, tiny as anything. "And so this humble knight brings a gift to this princess, in hopes that she will find it pretty to look upon."

"Wow!" says Jiaojung. "That's really pretty!" She leans close to inspect it. Of course to her if it's clear and shiny it has to be a diamond. She wouldn't know how to really tell. "It's a lovely little stone," she murmurs. "Are you going to use one like this on a ring for my sister?" She's not going to let up. She's almost as stubborn as Ming!

Thomas chuckles softly. "I'm sure whoever actually does will be a very lucky man," he replies, depositing it carefully in the girl's hands. "So why don't we wait and see who that might be?" And with that he turns, returning to the living room and reaching down for his backpack. "Heading out's probably a good idea.."

Ming nods quickly. By the time Thomas is out, she's got her costume put away in a large bag. "I was figuring we might want to, yes." She laughs a bit, "I imagine that you tried to tell her we aren't going out? And hmm.. failed, if what I'm picking up is right, too."

"Well, that's what I get for trying to use charm," grouses Tom, though he's smiling widely. "Next time I'll just put on my mask and say 'we are not going out' and hope that scares her into believing, hmm?" He's out the door as he finishes speaking.

Ming follows suit, shutting and locking the door behind her. There's a note left behind, since Ming kinda anticipated this. And she has a cel phone, just in case. "So, where to, Thomas? And she doesn't scare very easily. After what she's lived through, I guess that's to be expected."

"Where to?" Tom asks, with a smile. "The gym. I need some practice, and you'll get some benefit too."

Ming laughs softly, "You just want to see me in spandex, don't you?" she teases. She's going to have to badger Thomas, until he finally lets her have that autograph. She's hopelessly obsessive.

---

The "squash box" is a simple enough room - two racquets, one ball, four walls. Tom plays it rather differently. "I'm already as fit as I can probably get for awhile," he explains, kneeling in the lotus position, facing away from the front wall, his racquet resting in his lap. "I need to get on a serious exercise and diet program, but I just don't have time for it yet. I could cheat, but... well..." The racquet rises from his lap, as Tom closes his eyes. "My powers, though, are far easier to train up. So let's play a round. After that, mind-link with me, so you can feel my sense of perception at work. We're probably going to be using it in concert in the near future, so you want to get used to it."

"Hmm, not exactly my game, but I'll try my best," says Ming. She picks up a racquet, shaking her head. "This is very very weird." She snorts, "I'm a hero-wannabe who is now playing a game against a paddle that is floating around. Right."

"Just wait until you meet Foxbat again," replies Tom, calmly enough. "Sevice.." And so it begins.

"That guy is a complete moron," says Ming, hitting the ball harder than is strictly necessary. "That damn cat is a pain, too. Next time I'll be more prepared for them."

A few rounds and the score is about even, which doesn't surprise Tom too much. "You've got really good reflexes," he observes, as the ball and racquet levitate a few feet from his head. "Now.. come into my mind, and see what I see, and see if you can play that way, with your eyes closed."

Ming opens up her link, stepping as carefully as ever into your mind. (( So, like this? )) She shuts her eyes, saying (( If I always had someone nearby to link with, I wouldn't even need to use my eyes. )) She's shared Thomas' perceptions once before, but not for very long.

Thomas smiles. "Service," he says softly, batting the ball toward the wall, now a glowing mass of data and material analysis hovering in his mind. Its geometry and imperfections are glaring and its composition can be felt, almost like a sense of touch large enough to cover the entire surface of it.

The first swing is a clumsy one, guided half by impulse, half by sensation. She nearly misses, but there is contact, if not precisely controlled. (( That is weird! )) She tries to focus, not at all used to this kind of perception.

"It's easier.. if you.." Tom pauses, responding to the hit. ".. shut your .. sorry.." (( Shut your eyes. I was going to say close your ears, but I was speaking, stupidly. Sorry. ))

(( Right, sorry. Just opened them by reflex. Speeding ball coming at me, you know? )) Ming keeps them shut tight, this time. She's also a lot more prepared, as well, placing a solid hit on the ball. (( So you see this way all the time? ))

(( If I did I'd go nuts, )) replies Tom with a mental grin. (( Nah, I only use this when I have to. It gets too much after awhile, and it sort of creeps me out how people are these walking humanoid black holes, you know? Like I was watching a horror movie or something. ))

(( Must be strange. You know, I haven't mind linked with anyone before I met you. It doesn't hurt, does it? Sometimes after we all link I get headaches. Especially since Guy tends to rattle off grocery lists when I'm trying to think. )) She grins, keeping up with the game as best she can.

(( It doesn't hurt me. But I'm used to controlling my thoughts with a telepath in touch. )) Tom follows suit, exerting his powers to keep the racquet moving. (( I'm not touching the ball either, promise. ))

(( I'm not that worried )) replies Ming. She obviously isn't really a sports freak. (( You ever practice martials arts this way? I bet it'd be very educational. I've taken a few self-defense courses, so I'm not completely stupid. ))

(( Of course. This is how my sifu and I practice, lately. Since human auras extend out a bit from the body, it's more of a challenge, since I'm not sure exactly where a punch will land. )) Tom chuckles ruefully. (( And sometimes an aura extends before the punch itself, which is both good and bad. Good, because I can sometimes dodge early. Bad, because sometimes I dodge early right into another hit. ))

(( That would be a problem. As you may have noticed, my attacks are.. more mental. )) Ming grins, keeping up with the game more and more easily. (( This is still strange, but it's starting to feel right. I think the strangeness will go away with practice. ))

(( I wish some of my life's strangeness started feeling right with such ease, )) remarks Tom, laughing softly.
