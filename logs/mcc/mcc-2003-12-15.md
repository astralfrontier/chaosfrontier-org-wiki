# Millennium City Chronicles 2003-12-15

Club Pandemonium is packed. The Upper floor of the club is filled with the murmur of excitement, everyone filed in to get a good view of the action. Beneath, part of the seating areas have been roped off, while others line quite close to the dance floor. Numerous cylindric devices have been placed around the first floor, with a few on the second floor, all lit up. Radiating from the hubs look to be an arc of blue that fades into the air.

"Ladies and gentleman, your attention please." A crisply dressed man stands on a dias in the center of the dance floor, a simple raised platform ten feet wide. "Welcome to the first annual Total Pandemonium. We have asked a hand full of powerful individuals across the globe to come here tonight for a gladiatorial competition. Not for prizes, but for what many brave men and women do across the world: work for the betterment of people. Betterment through violence." That earns a little chuckle among the audience. "A match of skill. Our first match is brought by a surprise: Those local to Millenium city may recognize him. The Ghost Knight himself." That certainly sparks some interest in the crowd.

"His opponent, the up and coming hundred-decibel hero, Sounder!" The announcer's voice cuts through the cheering of the crowd as the round gets underway. The young superhuman on the other side of the ring, Tom reflects, couldn't be much older than himself. But still he radiated confidence. His skintight costume was striped, a clear homage to that of heroes that had come before. Thomas just shakes his head, watching the kid bask in the roaring adulation of the crowd. Then he launches himself forward.

Sounder throws out his sonic force-field, of course. Thomas just smiles, making a swiping motion with one hand. In a moment his own powers over the molecules of air asserted themselves, and the sonic wall is reduced to nothingness. His rival's eyes bulge behind the mask, and the Ghost grins visibly, throwing a punch. _Let's see if that's all this kid's got._ It isn't, and Sounder manages to dodge the initial attack. The Ghost sweeps in two more times, knocking his opponent to the floor and leaping back to avoid a clumsy counterattack.

The sonic hero tosses a blast of focused sound at his opponent, but the howling wave of screeching noise dissipates harmlessly with another curt gesture from the man in black. Again the Ghost grins. **Wrong move,** he observes, and as the lad picks himself up off the floor the vigilante is once again on the attack. Back and forth the battle goes, for several seconds - Sounder throwing his powers over sound at the Ghost Knight, and Thomas neutralizing them where he must, throwing a few well-pulled punches back in return. Finally he slips past his opponent, kicking hard and sending the striped hero to the floor of the arena hard.

Spikes jut from the floor suddenly, called up by the vigilante's power, springing up around Sounder and immobilizing him. The Ghost's fingers linger near the lad's throat as a silent suggestion to concede the round, and willingly he backs away and withdraws the spikes into the floor again as the youthful hero does just that. While the announcer proclaims victory, the Ghost leans in. **You did well,** he remarks, in a voice meant for no other ears. **My advice. Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Wear armor. Learn to fight. You are impressed with your powers, and rightly so. Learn to use them, not rely on them.** And with that he rises, returning to his corner and awaiting the next match.

While a fight commenses, between an acrobatic beast of a man and a bat-wielding biker woman, Ghost Knight is 'back stage', in an office area, waiting. "Congradulations, sir," Says an attendant, who offers Thomas an envelope. "This is for you."

Dear Mr Knight

It is a pleasure for myself to challenge you. You are, as I have read, a very capable and skilled man at arms for the good of the people. For that very purpose is the cause of my writing to you; I am a novice in the ways of battle. I have practiced, and am aware of my capabilities, but I have come up against very few with your skill and capability. Furthermore, I am not publicly known; this is my first attempt to 'Be Noticed' by the public. I come to the city in hopes of matching with likeminded individuals to congeal into a team effort.

Because of this, I was hoping you could resist humiliatedingly thrashing me to an inch of my demise. My request is not to go gently, but I ask you not to completely annihilate me within moments. I will not be ungrateful enough to strut about if you offer me this lenience, I will be respectful - to the extent that a proper showman should, naturally.

Sincerely,

The Hand

Thomas frowns a moment, and the note bursts into flames, crumbling to ash in moments. **Such peculiar people,** he observes to nobody in particular.

Two fights wage on, until it is Ghost Knight's turn again. As he steps out onto the dance floor, the announcer picks up. "The Ghost Knight, victorious, returns to us." The lights fall over the knight, as does his visage appear on the television screens placed on the platforms. "And we have the new comer, the Hand." The audience claps while across the rings, two force field generators turn off to allow the participant to walk out. He is tall and slender, looking for all the world like a victorian gentleman. A frock coat of charcoal rests over an ashen waistcoat and pale undershirt. Charcoal trousers come into leather loafers. A domino mask rests beneath a simple bowler. The opponent holds a cane of amber energy, seeming to have it simply to have it.

Thomas inclines his head slowly, then stands ready in the patient pose of a man expecting anything. This fellow's note has put him more on edge, and he's unwilling to make the first move before he sees what develops.

The Hand tips his hat in turn, and casts the cane aside to have it melt away. An ambiant tinge to the air fades into existance, and as gloved hands raise in the air, the man's loafers leave the floor with a gap of several inches. With little else he glides towards the Knight, but the eyes this one gives are careful, watchful.

The Ghost holds up a gloved hand; his opponent stops short, politely respecting the gesture as a request to withhold. Carefully Tom shrugs his way out of his longcoat, then turns and hangs the black garment on an invisible coat-rack - a rack he himself has created with his telekinetic power. The garment hangs there, apparently motionless, as he turns and beckons for his challenger to resume. This is perhaps not to be a battle of weapons, but one of wits and showmanship?

This earns approval from the audience, and a smile from the Englishman. "How rude of me." Slipping the frock coat off, folding it in half, and placing his hat atop it, a tilt of his wrist earns an amber 'table' to draw beside him, where the items are set. From there, he glides forward, presenting a gloved hand in a handshake.

After the shake in silence, he pulls the glove off, and drops it to the ground. When it hits the ground, he claps, sending threads of energy towards the Ghost Knight. Threads become a spinning, spreading cluster that, once over and around the Knight, begin to constrict and knit together, starting to clamp down.

Thomas suddenly moves, acrobatically flipping out of the way backward, planting his hands on the ground and returning to his feet at the end of the flip, six feet away. The coat hasn't wavered a hair in the excitement. The skull spreads broadly, revealing a nasty grin.

Thomas darts left, scooping the frock coat off the table. He flings it with perfect grace towards his own garment, and his powers invisibly sculpt the coat over a second 'coat-rack', so that it sits calmly beside his own.

As laughter filters down from above, The Hand can't hide his smile as the glide sends him through the field of still present energy, and as he moves through it the stuff congeals into a glowing thin sword. Feet touch the floor as he offers a, "Have at you," thrusting towards the ever grinning vigilante.

Thomas reels, his confidence shaken as a very accurate blow strikes home. Near him, two coats fall to the floor of the arena, and Thomas nearly joins them. He shakes his head, trying to clear it. His armor saved him, but barely.

The Hand darts back like a fencer, sweeping his blade as he poises, ready. The coats are plucked from the air as a coat-rack catches them just in time. The crowd takes a collective breath, before a cheer goes up. "Go England!" Someone calls out. "Kick his ass Ghost Knight!"

Rather then standing and waiting, The Hand lifts from the floor a good six feet. The sword falls from his hand, folding in itself as it begins to spin in the air, following the swirl of his fingers to break into pieces. The bits continue to spin, but now orbiting around his body in whirling disks. Then he draws back to hover a few inches above the floor, a beckoning gesture offered forth.

Thomas shakes his head, trying to clear it. _That really rang my bell,_ he thinks to himself weakly, drawing on his powers to restore his constitution. Fatigue poisons, stress, shocked nerves and damaged cells throughout his body are corrected, adjusted, eliminated, and he rises effortlessly from the floor, twin pools of wood rising with his hands as though something had liquefied the arena floor. The unearthly masses shape themselves into paired maces, and the Ghost stands ready to fight again.

With a simple discarding gesture, the spinning disks hurl themselves, circling each other until binding into a spinning saw blade moments before impending collision.

Thomas leaps out of the way, but not quite fast enough. The weapon impacts the Ghost on the side of the head, making his ears ring a little bit. It's not quite enough to knock him down again, though.

Thomas crouches down, one hand plastered flat on the wooden floor of the arena. The whole floor MOVES, sucked into some sort of void. As more and more of it leaves the surface, its destination becomes clear - the Ghost Knight is actually drawing the floor into himself, filling out his body with the stuff, until he looks like an armored knight sculpted from a tree's core. He leaps, his reinforced arms wielding his maces, and strikes decisively. The Hand falls, and the Ghost lands with a resounding smash on the other side of the arena.

The strike dumps The Hand into the floor, sending the crowd wild. Obviously he's been hurt, but with wrencing shoulders, he stays on ahnds and knees for a few moments orienting himself. Then once more the cane returns, and climbing back to his feet while propping with the aid, a wobbly bow is offered.

Thomas waits patiently, then offers a bow in return. He extends a hand, a gesture of invitation for his opponent to act, or to recover, as he wishes. Aside from this show of politeness, the Ghost Knight remains silent and motionless.

The Hand raises the ungloved hand to acknowledge the hit. A single digit is offered up, as if to wait. As the moments tick by, his strenght seems to return, and finally feet settle down on the floor, square and ready.

Striding forward, his hand flings outwards as if drawing a sword, and the weapon is back, a little more hefty, less for fencing and more for hacking. With a salute, the stance is taken up, and he darts forward with a sideways slash.

Thomas turns sideways, easily avoiding the thrust. The tapping sound of wood upon wood sounds as the unnatural golem-ghost steps across the arena, and the wooden face he now wears stretches into a solemn smile.

He makes two quick steps as the Hand makes two quick slashes across the air, leaving glowing slashes in the air that linger before they fly towards the knight. Another cut, another, before the sword-lunge sends it streaking towards the knight.

The wooden warrior sidesteps easily, his reflexes now tuned to the offensive nature of his opponent - as he suspected, and briefly forgot, "go easy on me" was a simple ruse.

It's the Ghost's turn to attack, and his twin maces swing - but do not connect. It seems he is not the only wary fighter in this arena, and as the crowd hoots and cheers, he backs away, prepared to deliver another telling attack.

With each sweep he glides fast side and side stiffly. Then the hulking knight drops downward, a trunklike leg lashing towards the man's knees. It hits air as the Hand flies upwards in a leap before dropping down several paces away, set and ready.

The third time's the charm - so says conventional wisdom. The weight of the wooden armor he wears encumbers the Ghost not at all as he leaps forward, kneeling quickly to avoid the Hand's defenses. His first stroke slams into the man's knees and sends him buckling; Tom spins, completing a circle by bringing the other mace down hard on his chest, and sending him with a resounding crash into the arena floor. He rises fluidly, dropping his maces without comment to the floor.

The building is a tomb, watching The Hand. To the Ghost Knight, one palm is raised weakly to acknowledge the strike. Then, obviously pained, the second glove is dragged off, and tossed up to his wooden opponent before The Hand passes out. The crowd explodes.

Thomas steps out of his wooden shell, carefully draining the surface of the arena back to its proper place. His maces, too, once again resume their station as part of the flooring. Only when this is done does he offer a low, sweeping bow of respect and admiration. He offers one more touch, too, before retreating to his corner - retrieving the magician's frock coat, with his own hands, and laying it over the man's shoulders.

The crowd continues to cheer as the protective field comes down, a stretcher and paramedics come out into the Arena, carefully picking the man. "The Ghost Knight!" Comes the announcer.

A small intermission is given to the audience - or more accurately, given to the participants to shake off the second round's wounds. The numbers have dwindled down to two. The Knight, and Blitzkrieg. As the tournament begins again, the two are on either end of the Arena. Blitzkrieg wears a suit of thin metal of black and red and chrome. His helmet looks more suited for a motorcyclist. Before, his motions were purposefully slow. The match is set.

Blitzkrieg, within a heartbeat, is a blur to the center of the ring before skidding to a stop, and simply stands there. Slow is the beckoning gesture. "Bring it on."

The dark vigilante crouches low, and his overcoat pools around his feet on the hard surface of the arena. He thrusts two fingers at the floor, as though pushing his very will by force into the resistant heart of the wooden surface. There's a sudden wind, and from the point of pressure a sheet of ice begins springing forth. It sweeps outward in a wave from the Ghost Knight's outstretched digits, encompassing the whole area of the arena. He looks up, rising, and strides forward confidently, passing over the ice as though it weren't there.

This seems to cause pause in the quickster for a moment before a chuckle escapes him. "Good." Spreading feet wide before and behind him, he begins to sway back and forth, slow at first, and then faster until he's almost a blur. Two steps quicker then the eye take him to the edge of the ice, and then he's rocketing across the ice on his chest, feet first towards the knight.

Thomas leaps into the air, doing a forward flip over the doomed speedster. He lands in a comfortable crouch, grinning and withdrawing weapons of ice from the floor beneath his feet. **Better luge next time.**

He continues to slide, slamming his hand into the ice and sending him into a spin. Keeping the turn going while spreading limbs out, the momentum is partially stolen by the time he hits the force wall. Blue energy crackles across like a bugzapper, bouncing him back across the ice.

Waves of heat and steam rise as Blitzkrieg's gloves glow. Ice melts beneath the warmth, and as he stands up, rather then glowing the gloves unleash sheer heat in lines across the ice, melting it in a thick swath to stand on.

In response, the Ghost Knight plunges his fist down on the ice. Around the arena, the frozen water begins converging, rapidly, piling around Blitzkrieg's legs, and creeping upward toward his arms.

"Cool." The ice rocks side to side for a moment before cracks start to spiderweb through. As arms burst forth the ice, he rapidly drums hands across the remaining areas and shattering it. "But I don't feel like chilling out."

Thomas leaps forward. **I'll put you on ice yet,** he remarks, swinging his maces, once, twice, three times in their painful pairing as his opponent breaks free of the icy containment.

Thomas waits for a fist to swing his way, then grabs hold of Blitzkrieg's arm. Almost effortlessly he throws the man, just as his uncle taught him, using the speedster's own leverage as a weapon.

Thump. "Ow." He makes a show of slowly standing up, then dusting off his armor. Hands go to hips, staring back at Ghost Knight. "This floor is for clubbing, not break dancing."

Before the man can even regain his feet, the Ghost's icy maces catch him - twice upon the chest, once upside the head, shattering the mace on Blitzkrieg's helmet, and finally one in the stomach. The speedster falls with a thump to the arena floor once again.

Blitzkrieg shakes his head, holding it for a second, then getting his feet under him in a crouch. Looking up, a salute is offered before he explodes upwards. Hands clap onto the Knight's shoulders while knees yank up into his opponent's face.

The Ghost Knight takes a short lived flight before he skids to a stop across the other side of the floor, only feet from the barrier's edge. Blitzkrieg snatches a chair and sits down beside the Knight, sitting down to wait.

As the Ghost Knight shows signs he's ready, the speedster is up with the chair in hand. It rockets down to slam into the surface of the floor, and all ready Blitzkrieg has the pieces in hands as make-shift cudgels before it dawns on him that the Knight is gone. "Hey!" Like lightning he moonwalks several yards back, waiting.

A black bolt shoots upward through the floor, from one corner of the arena, and the Ghost Knight ends up perched on the ceiling, clinging to it like a gecko, his black coat dangling and flapping slightly.

Sound erupts into a ringing wave of power. Blitzkrief leaps forward to get out of the way - and jumps right into the wave. Falling to the floor, the speedster just looks up. "Stop ringing the bell and come down here so I can clean your clock."

Down falls the skull headed figure, cloak fanning out like a net beneath him. Poised, ready to dodge, and just before he touches, Blitzkrieg is there with a simple, quick jab with two knuckles extended. Despite the contorting, it scores right into the Knight's side, folding him over onto the floor.

Blitzkrieg crouches down, saying quietly, "I can't keep letting you pull yourself back together. One way or the other, we close this down soon." With that he simply rolls over to begin doing pushups.

A moment later the Ghost is back on his feet, leaping upwards again, clinging to the roof. From stricken victim to full-strength vigilante, he sprung back into action and into the air. Now he hangs from the roof, stretching out his hand, grimly scowling behind his mask as he does the one thing he has left to do. _It's me or him... and his reputation is not on the line._

After several seconds of gasping (from Blitzkrieg, and from the crowd), the speedster slumps over, collapsing to the ground. There's a hush as the Ghost Knight drops from his perch on the ceiling, crouched down on hands and knees beside the unconscious figure. He slowly rises to his feet, looking about as though warily appraising the crowd, daring anyone silently to speak out.

The place has become a tomb again. The announcer is lingering at the edge, until Blitzkrieg regains conciousness. He gives a sigh, a simple wiggle of his foot. The announcer - and everyone else spots it. "And he's OUT. The Ghost Knight wins." There seems to be some displeased folks in the audience, but others are rooting.

Blitzkrieg is taken back on stretcher, even though he did try to walk and ended up disoriented. Moving fast and not baving all the proper blood in your head doesn't do well. A break is taken while the floor is being fixed - the wood removed to show the disco floor beneath. Meanwhile, in the 'locker room', a simple office converted for the contestents, Blitzkrieg is getting a breath of fresh air..

Thomas steps in after a few minutes, once the man's had his chance to regain something of himself. Once there, he regards his defeated opponent with an impassive gaze, the fleshless skull of his head not moving a bit.

A finger is pointed at the Knight. "That was a cheap shot. But, you were nice enough to, y'know, not kill me." Leaning back against the wall, "And it was one of your things. So, good job."

**By all rights, you should have had the victory,** says the Ghost, quietly, factually. **I won not because of my pride, but because of my power. I create fear. I am dangerous. This is my power, not.. this,** he says, demonstrating by way of levitating a nearby stack of papers, then setting them down again. **I sacrificed you to maintain that power. However, I also seek justice, and justice was not done. I apologize.**

Blitzkrieg gets up, and it's not fast. Strolling over, he punches the Ghost Knight in the chest. It's not like a blur. It's just a simple slug. "Okay." Sitting back down on a table. "I understand what it means to be a slave to your powers." This said while staring at his hands. "It's not fun."

**And yet it is the life we choose,** replies the vigilante. **And we are responsible for our actions. I will make this right. You may call upon me for whatever service you require. If this is not sufficient, tell me in what way this may be made right, and it shall be done.**

"All right, Mr Grim Reaper." The speedster crosses his arm. A nod of his head. "I'll expect your phone number or email address or crypt where I can reach you when I need you."

Reaching down, the Ghost plucks off a piece of the floor, then holds it in his hand. A phone number is etched out of the wood, as though written by a quill-pen of fire, and the Ghost extends this 'card'. **As you say.**

Claiming the card, Blitzkrieg takes it, and unzips a pocket on the hip. "I would say I look forward to seeing you, but I won't hold my breath."

**Nobody looks forward to seeing me,** says the Ghost, softly. **That is my nature.**

The fight is about to begin. The final challenge; everyone is abuzz. An attendant comes up to the Ghost Knight before hand. "Luther is rather upset about how you won the last fight. He wants to ask you not to do that again, at least here."

**Once is enough,** replies the Ghost calmly, waiting. **The point was made to the people who needed it.**

"Okay." He touches an ear piece. "Okay, go out into the middle of the arena, and wait please." The veil of the force field lowers, and in walks the Knight. The floor is different; rather then wood, but now plastered like a psychadelic checkerboard. The audience is excited. This continues for several moments before the field relents on either side of the arena, and from one side walks a woman.

She's in a flashy uniform colored a purple and yellow, dusted with sparkling flecks, a belt lined with strobes. Upon her neck is a medallion, reading "Disco Championship 1999". From the other direction walks Luther, a jumpsuit of white with orange flames licking up the cuffs and pantslegs. His shoes shine like a polished mirror, just like the amber sunglasses the jewelry that decorates fingers, belt and neck like a king's ransom. The medallion on his neck reads "Disco Championship 1973". The two walk until they stand a few feet on either side of the knight.

**It's too late for me to be Stayin' Alive,** remarks the vigilante softly, his words kept from the crowd and directed at the two.

"Ladies and Gentleman," Luther begins, "I am the Disco Inferno. I have been inactive for years after my retirement. But for this occasion, I am pulling on the threads and offering forth the challenge to this groovy cat. At the same time, I pass the torch down to my funky protege, the Groove." A gesture to the masked woman who nods. "The Knight has to un-medal us, to win. He has two minutes." The screens call up a two minute clock.

The Bee-Gee's music bleeds through the speakers as the lights of the floor turn on, sending hypnotic flashes across the combatants' clothes, the two dancing fools costumes coming alive with sparkling refractions. The duo begins moving, warming up the dance with a slow rock of hips, before feet follow suit. The clock begins: 1:59.

The Ghost Knight begins the exchange with a very simple approach: he makse a grab for the old man. One hand clamps down onto the Inferno's shoulder, biting down long enough for the gripped dancer to do drop into the splits, pulling himself from the grasp. The Knight's free arm is caught by the elbow and armpit, a dipping swing sending him hard to the ground and skidding, while the Groove turns the toss into a low-rolling move, coming back up with a shuffle of feet, dancing with her mentor.

The Ghost Knight thumps to the ground, rising slowly and warily after a few seconds of shaking his head. _Not again,_ resolves Tom, privately. He rises again, apparently undisturbed by the violent impact, and dashes forward.

Down comes the Ghost Knight with a scythe-sweeping leg. The Groove drops from below onto her hands, then back onto her feet in an easy tumble. The Inferno dives forward, onto hands then his shoulders in a tight spin. As the Knight rises, so does the white-suited dancing demon, body twirling in a corkscrew upwards, feet lashing in a rapid assault. But the Knight will have none of it, shifting to the side and letting each swipe pass him by a hair.

The duo continue to churn upon the multi-colored floor, before as one they turn. The Groove's belt lights up like an angry spotlight, blacklights and strobes blasting in rapid succession. The Inferno's jewelry - gold buckles, rings, even his necklaces - light up like a small sun.

The Ghost stumbles back, raising one arm - too late, far too late - in front of his eyesockets. He takes a few uneasy steps, appearing for all the world like a surprised and blinded fighter. An easy target.

The two dancing heros move on either side of the supposedly reeling Ghost. Then Luther spins, swinging the back of his leg at Knight's knee bend. Up comes the expectant leg, knocking Luther's up into a lashing hand. The Knight twists and throws the Inferno off of his feet.

Thomas turns, ready to make his attack - when he's set upon by Groove. The younger fighter goes for a grab, and this time the Ghost's trick of throwing his attacker is seen through and avoided. He's grabbed at, but his arms swing shut, managing to grab the incoming limbs and throw them off at the last second.

Free of troublesome obstructions - such as Groove - the Ghost Knight leaps forward, going for a hand-spring. With one hand planted firmly on the arena floor next to Disco Inferno for support, the other reaches down as the vigilante vaults overhead, snatching at the gold medallion that is the object of the contest. He completes the maneuver, coming up in a crouch with the glitter of gold in one black-gloved palm

The Groove is all ready moving, leaping into an airborn whirl following the tumbling Knight. Her kick hits him in the shoulder, but he moves with the force, batting the woman aside and stealing the bite of the strike.

Vaulting away, the Ghost continues his acrobatic motions across the arena, settling some twenty feet away. Carefully he tucks the acquired medallion into his longcoat's inner pocket, to keep it safe from any attempt by the duo to regain it in the time available.

1:42. The Knight has the first medallion within a quarter of his time. Disco Inferno kicks to his feet with a rhinestone swirl, and instead moves towards the Groove. The two are watching the Knight, also on the protective side. They dance around eachother, moving with easy rthyme.

The crowd, having offered 'ooos' and claps at some of the moves, are now getting a little more antsy. It's a dull roar among the music, especially with some who know the words singing or clapping along. Various calls for either side to beat the other, from encouraging to enthusiasticly angry.

Having spent a few seconds to regain his breath, the Ghost rushes forward. He vaults easily off the floor, passing overhead of the two disco heroes, landing easily on his feet behind Groove. Right where Disco Inferno is waiting.

The man takes a few wide, sweeping steps before leaping into the air. Legs swing wide, then snap closed, hooking his knees on either side of the Vigilante's head and twisting. The momentum of his flight and weight of his body drag the Ghost Knight down, while the Inferno comes out of it in a tumble that puts him back on his feet for a two-step.

Thomas manages to land softly, planting both hands on the floor as he comes down and using his body to spin, seeking to sweep the legs out from under Groove with the momentum he retains. Good, but not quite good enough, for the agile hero easily dances out of the way.

GK rises easily, in time to see Groove approaching for another chance at a knockout. Instead, the Ghost spins, slipping to one side of the approaching fist, grabbing hold of it and slapping his foot down on the arena to force Groove to eat floor rather abruptly.

After having dropped the Groove, GK rolls backwards intent on striking the disco fiend. Yet the lashing sweep does not take it's target; the target takes the leg, Inferno running across it and dropping down, kicking upwards while his quarry finds his feet. Back flies Ghost Knight, skidding across the slick floor, his black outfit reflecting the neon lights.

1:24. The crowd explodes at the display with applause. The Inferno helps his protege up off the floor, who takes time dusting her outfit off. They turn towards the Knight, moving closer but at the same time holding back, waiting.

Thomas rises to his feet again, then dashes forward, targeting Groove. He leaps into the air, twisting forward, planting his gloved hands firmly on the wood surface of the arena. As the flip continues, his hands leave the floor with half-formed maces intact, and he lands in a crouch to swing the improvised weapons hard against the Disco hero, who goes down satisfyingly.

The Groove hits the ground squarely, and is for a second seeing stars. But she's all ready in motion, rolling onto her shoulders and curling legs tight to her before lashing upwards in a square kick across the Ghost's midsection. He tilts backwards, arms coming out, one snatched up easily by the Inferno. A simple twist as he swirls around, driving the Knight to the floor.

With seemingly no effort at all, the Ghost Knight leaps off the floor directly, streaking upward, as he has in the previous battle. He clings to the ceiling, hanging upside down as though gravity were reversed, just for him.

The figure on the ceiling moves like lightning. In two heartbeats, a pair of spotlights are shattered, dimming the arena momentarily, as the figure stretches out angry fingers at the offending lights. Then it seems to leap, a black cloud as the Ghost - apparently - comes like an avenging shadow at the Disco duo.

The garment comes down, and the Ghost follows, zipping through it, landing on the floor in a crouch, concealed by the falling longcoat. In a flash his hands slide around Groove's own medallion, lifting it quickly away...

The Groove reacts purely on instict, turning a quick circuit to slam her elbow into the Knight. However, he is not there, whirling the Medallion by its' chain. Her hands fall to find it lacking. "Hey! He got it." The Disco Inferno claps his hands. "He got it!" And the audience explodes into applause.

Thomas vaults backward a few times, holding up both medallions as he regains his proper footing. His coat stirs on the arena floor, then whisks through the air, wrapping itself around him again, commanded by his unnatural power. His arms are stretched upward, displaying the shiny gold for all to see.

The audience gives a standing ovation, while the announcer comes out, proclaiming the Knight the winner. The lights flicker - except for the ones he had left ruined. There is no trophey, no title, but the Knight will be asked back for the next year's championship. No doubt someone else wants a piece of GK. Later, after the fight, Luther offers a handshake, while Blitzkrieg is off to the side.

Thomas shakes dutifully, once the heroes are away from the view of the crowd. **It was an interesting way to joust,** he remarks.

"You put on a good show, Mr Knight. Despite your dark approach," Blitzkrieg crosses his arms as if on cue, "You fight good. Glad to have you back next year. Glad to have you in the city."

**Day and night must come in their courses,** replies GK softly. **We may meet again.** And with that, he slips downward, through the floor, disappearing from sight, bound for some dark destination.
