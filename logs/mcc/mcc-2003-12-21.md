The bar's not crowded. A few are clustered around the tables, and a game of a foozeball is going on in the back. "Hey, Guy!" Sam calls to the detective heading for the stairs. "C'mere."

"Yeah?" replies the detective, using the word in a way that would make an English teacher cringe. He turns towards Sam, and begins a slow, meandering walk that way, casually scanning the few barflies for prospective cases. "Whatcha want?"

Sam holds up a check, waving it at Guy. "Found this sittin' on the bar this morning when I came in." The check has Guy's signature on it. One he didn't write. "You're caught up on the rent now. Thanks."

"What?" This can't be happening. _Okay... so I'm caught up on rent... where's the other 3 horsemen?_ Guy looks puzzled. "Uh hey Sam... can I take a look at that check? I don't think I remember writing one, let alone having a bank account..."

Sam gives the P.I. a funny look, before sliding the check over. "Refill?" He calls down to a guy who looks like today is his birth day - young, and drunk at two in the afternoon. The tender wanders on down to his customer.

"Heh." Guy shrugs, and takes a look at the check. _Wow, this guy signs my name better than I do,_ he muses, while examining it carefully. After having put on his gloves, of course. "Wonder if there're any prints..."

Nearly stumbling over a manilla envelope on his threshold, he powders the check while snagging the foot-trap. A partial thumb print along the bottom is scored, along with his and Sam's. The phone rings.

_Okay so someone's playing the 'mess with Guy's mind' game._ Guy shakes his head, and scoops up the manilla envelope and picks up the phone. "Guy Neville private eye... you need something done, and I'm your Guy..."

"Good, something needs doing," Croons a familiar voice. "How are you doing today?"

"...but unfortunately I'm not in the office right now, so please leave a message at the sound of the tone, and I'll be happy to get back with you as soon as I can. Beep." He peeks at the envelope, debating reaching into his pocket for that trusty lighter and burning it... but... he does the stupid thing and opens it instead. _I'm going to hate myself in the morning, but I wonder what's in here..._

"Cute. Okay, here's the deal. Your bill has been payed for. Consider that payment up front. Your team has a new member. I want to know what she can do. We all ready know who she is, but not what. And don't jerk me around like you did before. Also, in the envelope is information on an assignment. We want you to track down everything on this guy. Tell us what he's up to. Who he's in league with, everything. Earn your keep here, gumshoe." Click.

_I swear... if this is Foxbat, I'm gonna retire. Better still, I'm gonna give Foxbat this guy's home address and tell him that there's some kind of..._ Guy grins wickedly, pondering that thought. He hangs up the phone, and peers at the contents of the envelope. "Well let's see what they want this time..."

Edward Hald is the name on the mug shot, as well as the rap sheet that reads like a juvenile dilenquency text book. A native of New Orleans, Mr Hald has been out of jail for six years. However, the information in the packet goes beyond police reports. Mr Hald, or better known as "Snake" has been connected with several violent actions across the American Continent. From drug trafficing to ties with a rebellion in Argentina. According to the packet, he owns a warehouse in Rivertown.

_Now what in the world would he want with a loser like this guy... hm, maybe the warehouse._ Guy picks up the papers, _Snake... geez, that name hurts. So Mr. Snake... quite the rap sheet, well let's see where you are now..._ He picks up the phone and dials the MCPD, identifying himself and making a request for information on Edward 'Snake' Hald.

The only information they can provide is an address to his condo, also in Rivertown. Apparenlty Mr Hald has not been charged with any crimes within the city.

"Yeah yeah, well start a pool..." Guy hangs up the phone. _Rivertown. Yeah I can get there._ He puts on his standard-issue trenchcoat and fedora, and in the blink of an eye he's out of the office, moving rapidly towards rivertown. Rapidly for Guy anyway.

The warehouse is typical, like the others aroudn it; brick with new additions, well cared for but after ten years the age is showing through. A truck pulls in at one of the bay doors, a man yanking up the truck's back before the workers begin unloading barrels.

_Well everything seems normal around here, which means of course that nothing is. Or that something's very very wrong. Of course I'll have to come back later to prove it..._ Guy makes note of what's being unloaded, and by whom, and who is hanging out around the warehouse, before making a trip to the condos, specifically Mr. Snake's...

The condos are pleasant little things, homely even, with a decent view of the Detroit river. A decent view being several hundred yards over a fence and through some trees. Still, the condos are spread apart, choked in trees. No one seems to be home.

_Hmmm. Nobody home..._ Guy peeks around the condo, making sure. He keeps an eye out for security measures, after all, not everyone can go around invisibly... "Wonder if he's in..."

No signs of life appear to be present. The lights in the house are off. Fortunately the trees offer very few places where a neighbor might see Guy sneaking around. A glance into the one car garage proves that no one is home.

_Well the worst that can happen is pretty bad... but then it can't be worse than listening to Foxbat._ Guy looks around, carefully, attempting to spot a place to teleport in from, or, barring that, a place to quietly pick the lock and take a look around inside from...

The back door shows signs of a lockpick, but otherwise Guy makes it inside unnoticed. The place looks less like the place of a well traveled criminal and more like a goofy slob. Knicknacks from voodoo dolls to a mounted deer's head decorate the man's house. On the ktichen table, an ugly thing with Elvis tablecloth, is a stickie note. A number scribbled quickly across it.

_Ugh. Even I have better taste than this, and that's saying something..._ Guy notes the hastily scribbled number that serves as the king's nose, before continuing his examination of the place. He glances around, afraid to touch anything for reasons aside from leaving evidence...

The path is made down into the basement. A yank on the chain send the naked bulb swinging back and forth to pull shadows along with it. Though the detective's eye spots something; a reflection of the light through some loose boards along the wall.

_Huh... wonder what's in here..._ Of course these words are usually famous last ones... but Guy, well, he goes on to investigate anyway, peering through the boards before looking around for a way to move them aside and back, without leaving any more visible signs of disturbance than he has to.

After a few seconds deduction, Guy discovers that the boards lead to a small 'pocket', a walled up room that is nearly a crawlspace. One board is removed, the other slid up to fit, a third slid downward, allowing him to step through. Nearly tripping over an electrical cord, this leads him to a lamp, which he turns on. Within the space - among a few fleeing spiders - are three trunks with heavy padlocks.

"Huh. Well, I suppose if you're gonna catch a criminal... you'd best act like one..." He sighs, and peers at the trunks, looking around for a set of keys, or something. _I mean, why'm I gonna pick a lock just to get at a Velvis..._

After a bit of searching, Guy checks Underneath one of the trunks. After rubbing his hand across the dirt, he feels the coolness of metal under his touch. Half buried in the soil is a shiny key. It's slipped into the lock and turned. Pushing open the trunk, Guy is treated to the sight of shadows clinging to the metallic body of some ugly rifle with a wide barrel. And with one look to what else is in the trunk - shells the size of Guy's wrist - it's obvious what the weapon is with a few looks. A grenade launcher.

"Sweet merciful..." exclaims Guy, as he discovers one of the grenade launchers. He shakes his head, _There is NO way this thing is legal... I think I'm gonna have to do something about this._ He checks for keys to the other two trunks, before picking up the shells and the gun, trying to figure out a way to disarm this... permanently.

Only one other key is found. The third trunk proves to be the owner of the key, and when it's opened, a new proble presents itself: several machineguns. Not uzis or simple M-16s, but two large, dangerous looking things with several banana clips inside the trunk.

"Well then... someone's planning a fun, shiny, happy little get together..." Guy picks up the radio, "Hey... hey GK? You there?"

It's several seconds before the voice on the other end of the line responds. **Speak.**

"Hey yeah, I need a bit of a favor, I think. I uhm, found a buncha weapons that someone really shouldn't have. If you can get over here, it's a funny story, and I'll tell ya all about it, but these need to be taken care of. And fast." Replies Guy.

**Where are you?** asks the dead voice after a moment's pause.

"Rivertown." Replies Guy, as he gives the address as well.

Minutes tick by, leaving Guy nervous with this small stockpile. The owner may come home at any time. But the Ghost Knight arrives, stepping through the wall and into the small alcove arsenal.

The vigilante pauses for a moment, then gestures. **Speak.**

Guy explains what's going on, taking care to leave nothing out. "So yeah I came here to check this guy out, and well, here we go..."

Guy says, "Call it a hunch, but I bet he's plannin' something nasty..."

**Who is it that is giving you these orders?** asks GK, after hearing the explanation.

Guy says, "Oh, the same guy that told me to spy on you guys. Or his crooning croney, rather."

Thomas shakes his head. **This business cannot continue,** he states flatly. **If you intend to remain with us, you must sever your ties with this man. When you have made your decision in this matter, I will do what I can about these weapons.**

Guy nods, "Consider them cut. But a tip's a tip, and this time, the tip paid off. I think. In any case..."

**I do not think it will be as easy as that,** remarks GK coolly. **If you are serious, you will aid me in tracking him down, in due course. Until then we have more pressing business to attend to.**

Guy nods, "Now of course it's not gonna be as easy as that. I'll have to hang up the phone, and deal with his more... uh... hands-on... goons, but I'll take him down." Guy smirks, "Yeah... we do."

Guy says, "Pressing business."

Time passes, as the Ghost concentrates. He shakes his head after awhile. **The work is incorrectly done,** he remarks, as he begins the process over again, gloved hands smoothly gliding over barrels and magazines and firing chambers. **Firearms are a new and difficult concept.**

"Ahhh. Well uh... I guess... just be careful with the grenade rounds. Hmm. Hey is there any chance you can help me get a peek at what's in this third chest right here?" Guy indicates the unopened box, "I'll bet it's full of all kinds of other goodies.

Thomas sighs inwardly, but gives no outward sign as he finishes tampering with the weapons a second time, with more productive results. One gloved hand reaches down, grasping the padlock; it comes off the chest, held securely in his hand, and he drops it to the floor.

Inside the chest are more machineguns. However these are different design, an upper-over design with an auto-fire above and a shotgun below.

These too are neutralized by the Ghost's uncanny power. And when it is done, he replaces the padlock just as it was removed. **Once this matter is resolved, Guy, I would like to track down the Professor. I trust I can count on your assistance.**

"Sure thing GK. We'll find him, no problem." Guy chuckles, nervously. Though he's quite sincere when he says, "You'll have my help. Can't say it'll be easy, but I'll do my best."

Thomas inclines his head. **Then I will be here, should you require my assistance in this place further.**

Guy nods, "Certainly..." Now that this is taken care of, Guy gestures back out, replacing the boards where they need after they're out. He moves to continue the search, looking for things that would indicate just where those weapons were headed...

While Guy stalks away, leaving GK alone in the weapons lair, the vigilante quietly pulls out a physics text and cracks it open. _Can't believe he interrupted me in the middle of study hour,_ Tom thinks to himself. _I need a fuckin' secretary._
