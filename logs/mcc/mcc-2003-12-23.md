The fingerprint found on the check belongs to a punk named Carl Bedessy. Carl doesn't talk - for the first ten seconds until the Knight removes from the wall a mace of spikey brick. Then he talks - and doesn't shut up. Apparently the check came down from a man named Joseph Bosher. A quick check proves that Bosher is a socialite - a home in Gross Pointe, a fancy apartment complex near the gated communities along the St. Claire lake. The pair decide to head to Joseph's place near two AM. He's in, along with someone else.

"So we'll make a killing," Explains a male voice. "You don't say," Replies a female voice. "Yes. Gullable old man. I've done some checking with a few people and he had a daughter with an escort a few decades ago." "And I'm supposed to stand in." "Exactly."

"A little more Brandy. I'm not tipsy at all," Intones the woman with a teasing tone. "All right - be right back." Obviously it's Bosher who moves through two rooms, where a mini-bar of liqours has been set up within an attempt at a study.

"So what're they talkin' about GK?" whispers Guy, as he keeps his own watch, though he's quite sure that the undead vigilante is much better at keeping tabs on things than he.

Shrugging, the Ghost reaches out a hand. The lock on the door snaps open quietly, and the vigilante steps through the otherwise-solid door as he answers, **Another job. Come..**

Guy nods, and follows after the Vigilante, making sure his fedora is kept tipped in that 'about to burst in on you and ruin your date' manner. He is well aware that actually causing a panic and such is a bad idea though... but it never hurts to be prepared. He nods to GK, motioning for him to lead the way.

The interior of the apartment looks like someone attempting to look rich. But it certainly looks like a professional decorator went through in a whirlwind. Joseph is in the study, tipping some brandy into two glasses. His back is to the desk, which is at least well maintanied and orderly, with papers and a few day planners.

The Ghost extends two gloved hands. The dayplanners on the desk are drawn by his power, silently flinging their way through the air into his grasp. He hands one to Guy, then begins leafing through the other one at an incredible pace.

Guy reads through the day planner he's been handed at a rather rapid pace, but not quite as rapid as GK does. He's skimming, looking for information that catches his eye, should any such things present themselves.

In the Ghost Knight's day planner, Guy's name is listed on several days within the month. The time of day he was called, with little notations. Below, in the notes section, it describes the subject of each call. "Carl Bedessy, check for Nevielle's apartment." "Ming Tiaoning. Edward "Snake" Hald." Earlier, "Request for report on Shawntae Howard." "Powers of the Team." Two days before the first calls to Guy are made, a note, "The Professor: Guy Nevielle to observe Ghost Knight and his associates."

Guy's day planner regards a woman by the name of Amelia Grok, which reads back several months. The calls are more spare. "Send information package on the Stalking Jogger," The date yesterday. "All information on the Dew Chemicals assassination attempt," Dated last week. "Destroy evidence on Sidney Eddings case," The three weeks ago. "Send package of info for Tellings' Warehouse burglary and murder," Last month. Two days before the first calls were made, "Professor: Seargent Amelia Grok, MCPD."

The two intruders are out of sight, and unseen by Joseph as he walks towards the living room.

GK gestures to Guy, then at the turned back of their quarry. Boldly he steps out, longcoat trailing behind him, and with all stealth his dayplanner is set back down on the desk. **Joseph Bosher,** looms a voice throughout the building.

Guy sets the dayplanner down on the desk, and while he might not be as imposing as the Ghost Knight, with his Skullface Mask and all, he does have that Fedora. Ad so he steps out alongside of GK, trenchcoat trailing behind him.

Bosher almost jumps. He does spill a little brandy. "Joseph?" Calls the woman down the hall, as the man turns. He looks just a little pale, but smiles none the less. "Ah. You. I was warned you'd show up eventually." He offers a glass forward, "Brandy?" All ready it looks like the nervous stress is melting from Bosher's body - or at least being hidden.

One gloved hand snaps out in a violent gesture; the liquor rack shatters, as decanter after decanter breaks into shards of glass, spilling the pungent aroma of alcohol out. **What is your business with me?** asks the Ghost, cold and certain as death itself.

He winces, just a little. Setting the glasses aside, Bosher rubs his hands down the front of his shirt. "Okay. I guess I'm the interrogated villain type guy you're hassling down. Well, I know nothing." Looking towards his desk, "Hey, my day planner..." Frowning, looking back, "If I had a day planner, I'd show you. I'm sent information, that I'm supposed to pass down to Guy Nevielle - I'm his wrangler, the go-to guy. All I know is who sends Me what I need to send to him."

**Keep talking.**

Joseph turns enough to see Guy - when you have the Skull Face in your presence, most things are often ignored. "Oh, hello. Yes, I'm the guy on the phone. Anyways, I was roped into this becasue I conned a few people out of several hundred thousand dollars. They found out, and wanted me dead. The Professor stepped in, payed them off, smoothed the waters, and now I work for him. I don't know who he is, but I know who does. You want to see Him, right? Since I'm a middle man, I can hook you up with the guy above me."

**Then do so,** replies the Ghost, calmly.

"Right." Joseph fishes into his pocket and retrieves a nice cell phone. He makes a call. Giving a sigh, he makes a second call. "Woman never picks up." Finally an answer. "Hey, it's Bosher. Yes, I know what time it is. It's inconvient for me too. Trust me, it is. I need, hold on-" He puts a hand over the mouthpiece. "You want to see the Professor, right?"

Thomas nods.

Guy nods, "Yeah."

"I need to see the Professor. Yeah, I know, I can't meet him. But they're here. No. Yes, that them. They want to meet him." Joseph taps his fingers on the desk. "So this was expected? Yeah, figured as much. Okay, they want to meet him." A smile shot towards the Knight, though it's hesitant. Holding the mouthpiece, "She's checking." Another heartbeat. "Okay." A piece of paper is removed from his desk, and he begins to write. "Is that on Third or fourth? Okay. ...1938?" He scratches that. "1930. Gotcha." He hangs up, and claps his hands. "Okay, you're cleared."

Thomas snaps up the paper. **There is no ambush I cannot escape. There is no distance you can run that will keep you safe,** he intones carefully. **Think on this.** And with that he turns to leave.

Guy gets that annoyed look on his face. He pinches his nose as though he's got a headache. _Oy. I've got that headache again, that little pain right here, the kind I always get when dealing with people who plan on just about everything that happens. Ow._ "Hey wait up..." To Bosher, he asks, "Hey, got any aspirin?"

Bosher lets out a silent sigh of relaxation. "Trust me, I don't like my ass in a sling from any direction." A pause, then a nod to Guy. "Sure. Wait right there, got some in the bathroom." He pushes into the hallway, quietly saying, "I've got everything under control." "Well it's good to see you squirm," Replies the woman disdainfully.

Joseph returns with some asprin and a glass of water. He seems content with the current situation. "And leave the day planner. And let's keep this hush hush; I'd hate for the other people I'm watching to come down on my head and be less... reasonable then you two are. No skin off your backs, none off mine." Guy is given a clap on the shoulder.

Guy nods, "Right of course." He shakes his head, and takes the aspiring. _Why is it always that same spot? And don't forget to check up on Amelia Grok. ASAP._ "Well here's hopin' you get exactly what you deserve. Have a good night."
