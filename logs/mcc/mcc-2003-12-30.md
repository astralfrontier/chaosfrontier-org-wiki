# Millennium City Chronicles 2003-12-30

Friday, 3 PM. On a local news radio, "Early this morning Police apprehended a man suspected to be the Jogging Stalker - Eran McMillan was arrested in a suburban home in Dearbone. Police are still looking into the evidence, but amazingly the call came in as an annonymous tip to the whereabouts of the arrested suspect. I'm sure everyone can breathe easier now that he's wearing a pair of cuffs."

Downtown Millenium city. A hub of activity as people pass back and forth along the street, going to appointments in law offices, standing outside to smoke cigarettes, or catching a late lunch in the overpriced fastfood around the doctors offices, law firms and other similar establishments. Smack dab in the heart of the urban jungle is Starbucks. And dwelling within it's dark depths is the notorious Foxbat. Five individuals have gathered to deal with the troublesome loon. They wait with baited breath as DarkGlow sinks into the shadows to survey what lies ahead of them.

...and slips back out a short while later. "He's reading a comic book. Alone. I was slightly tempted to just wrap him up in a shadow-made straight-jacket, but considering what happened last time, I decided that massive overkill wouldn't be out of place--nutbar or no."

Thomas nods. **Let's take him,** he decides.

Clarity considers this news carefully. "We must be ready for a trap. He may be an imbecile, but I'd rather not be surprised. Let's do this quickly and quietly."

DarkGlow s murky hood points in Clarity's direction. "Say, doc--have you come up with some team battlecry, for just that extra bit of team unity?"

Clarity grins at DarkGlow, "I have, but somehow I don't think 'kill them all and let god sort them out' is really a good battle cry."

DarkGlow shrugs. "It'd work for me. Do we go on 'three', or just, well, go? I wouldn't want to disturb the teamwork, after all."

Ambiance tilts his head towards the Ghost Knight. "Is he normally this snarky?"

"We go whenever you are capable of acting like a big boy," answers Clarity. "Feel free to take a time out or a nap, if you must. Ghost Knight, if you would be so kind as to help me get in quietly?"

**To each his own,** replies GK, softly. **I will arrange it.**

"Well I wouldn't go so far as to say he's an imbecile. He's either genuinely loony, or one heck of a good actor. Either way... he has some kind of smarts to him..." Guy turns to DarkGlow, and suggests, "I think if we all go on three, or somethin' it'd be fine. Okay... GK, can you sink Miss Clarity and I down into the pits of despair? By which I mean the everpresent Starbucks..." He ponders, "In any case, if we really need a battle cry, I think something along the lines of: Justice is Served, fits in well. It has the same meaning as 'kill them all' but you get that extra bit of rationalization in there, if you really want it. As for me... well I'm ready... now..."

DarkGlow barks a laugh. "Last time we went up against this bozo, I got blasted and Ambiance et al showed up. I'd say call it nerves, but if he was honest, skullface'd probably answer 'yes'." He laughs again, the sound for once containing humour. "Sorry, doc." The words sound sincere. "Shall we go, people?"

Ming nods to DarkGlow and lets out a soft sigh. Here goes her first official super showdown, it seems. At least this time she's wearing armor and looks the part. Which is to say is dressing in the eccentric, corny outfit that identifies her as a super hero or a lunatic. "I'd hate to keep our friend waiting any longer.." She is as ready as she can be.

"Yes, who knows what nefarious plans he has made for when the last page of that comic goes by..." DarkGlow gives an ironic wave and fades into shadow.

The Ghost Knight strides to the wall of the Starbucks, and as he walks the earth boils and rolls before him. A shaft of concrete has subsided to form a slanting tunnel, for Guy, Ambiance and Clarity to leap into. As the tunnel opens up, the travelers downwards are greeted with the sounds of a dog barking. Beneath the tunnel is a jumping, snarling chihuahua, wearing a little brown-and-yellow hat. It hunkers down as they get closer, snarling, before darting away.

The Ghost Knight walks through the wall, and falls through the roof into a crouch, beside him stepping from the shadows is DarkGlow. The _base_ is a single room basement, with a couch, a PC with the label MASTER COMPUTER and some LEDs covering the hard drive and monitor, a large, silvery contraption that looks like some sort of high-tech version of a 50s coke machine, and finally, Foxbat. Foxbat is seated in a button-laiden swivelchair, his pingpong ball poised. "You've breached my defenses!" The decloration is squeaky, one which 'No Fair' would sit well with. He leaps out of his chair, then pauses. "Wait! Pause! If we're going to fight, I need to prep the music!"

Clarity steps into the 'base' with a sigh. She watches the dog depart and projects (( You have got to be kidding me. )) As she strides further into the secret lair she answers Foxbat with, "I'm afraid the only music you'll be hearing will be sweet sounds of a jail cell door closing and the proposals of your new jail husband." (( Let's kick his butt. ))

Guy bursts through the tunnel created by GK, and strikes his best butt-kicking pose, and it's with a shrug of his shoulders he prepares to do battle with Foxbat. "Alrighty, prep your music. We'll be busy kicking your butt while you do that."

Foxbat drops into his chair. "That sounds like a merry tune! But so is **this**." He presses a button on the chair, and speakers in the walls blare out the beginning notes of _I'm a barbie girl._ "Wrong music!" He punches another button, as Bach's Tocatta begins to blare. A second and third button are punched, the machine behind him coming to life with a blare of lights and whirring. The coke machine's door swings open, showing a rack of smiley-faced projectiles. "And I had to prep the defenses."

Ambiance blinks, surveying the lair and it's inhabitants. "I all ready need some Tylenol."

As the door starts swinging open, Guy springs into action, darting around to one side of the diabolical Coke machine! In the span of the blink of an eye, the smiley faces are pointed right at Foxbat, and he raps it smartly on one side, and flashes the 'two-thumbs up' "Ayyyyy."

The shadows behind Foxbat amass, roiling like a coiled snake, before lashing forth in a spring-loaded strike. Foxbat whirls, and is struck across the side, sending his chair skidding across the concrete floor, just as one of the smiley-faces launches from the machine to crack against the wall with a CRUNCH, then erupting in a flash of light and glitter.

Ambiance begins to glow like a small star, shaking his head. For the moment the man is simply going to stand back and watch in bemusement, his guard ready.

The Ghost Knight is content to lean up against the wall beside the tunnel he crafted, arms folded across his chest. His sense of perception is in operation, but he's not yet inclined to take action.

Ming will, for her part, more or less just watch. To amuse herself, though, she'll reach out to grab hold of a crate of comic books and throw it towards the computer, which she suspects is probably running on ten year old technology. She makes sure that the books fly all over in the process, if possible. (( This is really embarassing.. ))

With a resounding keeeeeeerunch, the Coke Machine of DOOM is pushed over on it's face, smiley face missiles clanking in their racks, waiting to be served up. Guy then gives a tip of his Fedora to Foxbat, eyes closing as he tries to slow the maniacal villain down... but to no avail. _He won't sit still! Gah!_

As Foxbat rolls from the chair, coming to his feet near the center of the room, the man shakes his head. "Ah ha! I figured you'd show your face!" A flick of a switch on his belt activates small spotlights on his belt that blare outwards, shielding him in a small nova of light. "Hey!" Foxbat says in little more then a surprised squeak. "Hey!" Sounding a little more aggravated, "Now that was uncalled for. Those comics never hurt anyone!" He pauses a second, peering towards Clarity. "You're new. Who're you? No matter! You come into my secret lair and mess up my comics, you shall Rue the day!" Up comes the pingpong ball gun, in slow motion for just a second. It fires, the ball flying through molasses for a second, and then it's speeding towards Clarity.

The ping pong ball screams towards Clarity. The very walls launch forth intending to snatch up the projectile, but it threads through a gap in the reaching tendrils to strike the woman in the chest. The pingpong ball explodes in a brilliant light, sending her off her feet and into the stone wall. Foxbat pumps his arm at the shot, but for a moment looks a little worried at the crumpled, blue form.

The Coke Machine Defense System blasts another rocket, sending it rolling over and into a wall to fall face - up towards the ceiling.

DarkGlow snarls under his breath as Foxbat's belt lights up. _Fortunately he's not_ quite _a Christmas tree, and I'm not afraid of hitting below the belt..._ Hoping to break one of Foxbat's ankles, but content to just crash him on his keister, DarkGlow sends a whip of shadow strikes low, along the ground, and connects.

The radius of light around Foxbat ripples like a disrupted pond. The villain falls downwards, but is on the uprise his protective light becomes bright, coiling around his eyes. "Ah! Okay! Two can play at that game!" gropes across his belt and snatches a ball from it, popping it into his gun, before kicking into a run towards the center of the room.

The Ghost Knight is there a heartbeat later, crouching and drawing weapons from the floor. Still in his half-crouch, he slams them into Foxbat, one behind the knees, the other in the abdomen, and Foxbat goes down.

Guy holds a hand up as the light ripples around Foxbat, shielding his eyes from the bright glow, and as soon as GK slams Foxbat to the floor, the Detective is in motion. Power cords whip about as he yanks them off of the computer and monitor, and there's a rush of wind as Guy wraps them around Foxbat, tangling him in the cords of his own Master Computer! "Technology's wonderful, ain't it?"

DarkGlow wanders over to the downed Foxbat, squinting against the glare. Pushing aside the wire wrapping, he presses a likely looking switch on Foxbat's belt. The light extinguishes. "Made the belt just for me, huh? I'm flattered."

Foxbat lets loose a grunt from the ground before struggling against the straps. "Hey, I can't see - that's not what heros do!" He writhes on the floor, before making it up into a sitting position. "Yes! Yes I did. Now, we can act like civil enemies once I get out of these cords..."

"Foxbat," calls a familiar voice from across the room, "I got the distress ca-" The Chesire Cat pauses a second, while surveying the room. "Well, I see I'm a little late. Just in time to enjoy the show?"

Guy turns towards the Cheshire Cat, "Well now we know what the other button did. It summoned the rest of the Baddie Brigade." He turns towards the Cheshire Cat, pointing a finger at him, and for some reason looking rather ineffectual. The crate on the other hand, loses a good deal of agility as it's movements are slowed and sluggish. Too bad it's just kinda laying there on the ground.

DarkGlow eyes narrow in recognition as he spots the teleporter. Wordlessly he sinks into shadow and rises again behind the Cheshire Cat, sinking his sharpened shadow into the other's back and viciously twisting. _Skip lightly away from that one, why don't you..._

Clarity sits up rather silently, feeling rather disgruntled and wondering for a moment if her feelings about not killing villains are truly free amendments and exceptions. Sadly, she decides that she shouldn't be killing people. Yet.

The Cat falls forwards, bleeding harshly from his back. "Jesus that hurt." "Chesire! Outside!" The burglar disappears with a wince, while Foxbat rolls on his back to stretch out on the floor. Up come his feet, and he slams down on a segment of the concrete. The ceiling above swings open, while the patch he lies on erupts upwards in a springboard, sending him sailing into the crowded Starbucks above, much to the astonishment of the patrons. His place is traded as a man falls down, coffee splattering across the board while he lands on hands and knees. "What the hell-"

The Ghost leaps upwards as well, shooting effortlessly through the roof like a black angel and regaining his feet in the coffee-shop.

Guy watches as Foxbat tries to get away. "Oh no ya don't... not again!" And with that the Detective launches himself upwards, moving much to fast to even leave a blur behind as he blinks into existence inside of Starbucks, his perception shifting from Ultra-Super Fast, to merely Bullet-Time.

Hurtling through the air, Foxbat twists his body, bouncing off a table and skidding feet first through a window. Writhing his body, by sheer dumb luck or simple skill, the glass shreds the wires while leaving him relatively unscathed sans a few knicks. The villain picks himself up, and fires into the coffee shop. Smoke explodes into the crowded shoppe, sending everyone inside into a panic. They bump and push against Guy and the Ghost Knight.

Smoke pours into the lair from above. Ambiance moves with a sweep of his jacket to pick up Clarity, moving quickly over to the tunnel. A swelling of light scoops her up and lifts the woman through the tunnel, while his form becomes simple radiance, darting up the path ahead of her.

DarkGlow's expression betrays a flicker of annoyance as Cheshire Cat vanishes from in front of him, but smiles at the blood puddled on the floor. _However, when it rains, it usually pours._ He notes Guy and GhostKnight flitting after Foxbat and, figuring the situation is in hand, almost cheerfully slides through shadow back outside to his original entrance point. Invisible and radio ready, he scans for any sign of the Cat, or his friends.

Foxbat takes a moment to run into an alley, loading up his pingpong gun and removing something from a pocket behind his cape.

Guy coughs as he teleports into a smoke-filled area, and before he can become terribly blinded, he blinks outside of the coffee shop, getting out of the way of panicked customers and maniacal villains alike.

Almost immediately the smoke begins to gather near the center of the room, drawn there by the Ghost's power. He compresses it, then shoots it out one window to let people breathe and see once again.

(( This is the last time I charge in anywhere )) decides Clarity. (( Where is everyone? )) She's got no bearings for anything, so she might as well sit around and do nothing until she gets some information.

People spill forth from the Starbucks in time to see a swirling purplish rift rip into the air. Spilling forth from it is a winged Powersuit, Bluejay flying high before swooping to survey the street from above. Black Diamond falls onto a handspring that leaves cracks in the streets, coming up to her feet. Chesire slides out, looking a little less pained but still bleeding.

An azure beam lances through a side window, hitting the Ghost Knight in the chest and sending him crashing through the register stand, spilling coffee beans and change everywhere. Lightning crackles through the shop, small fires scorching across the ground.

Ambiance turns to Ming. "I hear fighting across th-" He is cut off as the air around him ripples, before a crackle of electricity flashes. The light manipulator is gone.

DarkGlow spots Foxbat, and has his eyes immediately drawn to the Dimensional Duplicator or whatever the hell it is. Normally not terribly possessive, DarkGlow can't help thinking _Mine!_ as a tendril snatches it from Foxbat's grasp. He rapidly hauls it back to himself.

The coffee shop explodes in motion. A black-barded horse leaps around, crashing across tables before jumping through a wall, carrying it's black-armored rider as though they had splashed through water. Across the street they go, bounding over a car before it hits them - and in turn smacks right into a news stand. The horse rears on it's back legs, while the horseman draws an ebony sword, surveying the field as people run screaming and GRAB merely stares onward.

Thomas hauls himself to his feet, shaking his head and looking around a little groggily. _Who hit me? And with what?_

Inside the shop is a mild-mannered man, looking stunned. The other is much like the Knight, almost human but rather than armor, it appears to be simple chitin. WIth one look around, the naturally armored skull-face dives into the floor.

"Bluejay. The shadow guy is here somewhere," Says Chesire, "Look for him." "I'm on it," Replies the suiter as she hovers a moment in the air, surveying. Everyone seems to pause a second as the rider peels into the open. "Uh." "I got a lock on him."

It doesn't take long at all for Tom to realize what's happened. **You and you!** he barks, pointing with a gloved finger. **You, get up! Follow me, right now!** And with that he makes for the door outside.

Clarity sighs softly, shaking her head. She'll start making her way out, trying to see whatever it is that is happening out there. (( Well, Ambiance is gone, now. )) Time to see who got hit this time.

The Chitin-wearing copy pauses, his armored skull the only thing visible. After a moment's hesitation he comes up, and follows GK's orders. The seemingly mundane duplicate nods, before walking outside - and a cry for help comes from the news stand demolished by the car. He takes a running shot across the street towards the crumbled stand, where an arm flails underneath the vehicle.

From above, Bluejay swoops over DarkGlow's position, an angry green light whirling around her gauntlet before it lances downwards and smashes into him from above, buckling his knees and slapping him harshly across the street.

Thomas runs across the street as well, gesturing with both arms. Like a conductor whose symphony is the material world, the shattered remnants of the news-stand obey his commands, flinging themselves away from whoever or whatever may be trapped underneath.

A bloody man slides out from beneath the car. The Thomas look-alike drops to his feet and begins checking on the man's vitals, while the driver of the car gets out, looking severely shocked. "Is he dead!?" Sirens blare in the distance.

The Horseman's stallion comes to all fours, as the knight surveys across the area. A booming, clothes-shaking voice rattles forth. **Name yourselves, and your purpose, now.**

Foxbat whirls around, the device plucked from him. He darts across the street, clicking something on his visor. "Ah ha!" He skitters across and kicks DarkGlow out of the way, plucking the device from him and putting it in place. "_Yoink!_" He waves to Bluejay. "Pick me up! Let's make a dramatic exit!"

Two cop cars skid into the street, pausing short of the horseman. Four cops jump out of the cars, guns held. "Okay, Everyone Freeze!"

Ming glares at the Cheshire Cat. (( You won't slip away so easy this time, you little pest )) she sends along the link. With a hiss of pain she lashes out at him mentally, sending lances of imagined ice into his skin.

There's a brief moment after Foxbat yells, 'Yoink' in which Guy appears next to Foxbat. A brief struggle ensues, during which Guy manages to wrest control of the device from the foul fiend. He is unable to resist uttering the phrase, "YOINK!"

Noting the thoughts fluttering through the link with Ming, Thomas distracts himself from the cops for a moment to transmit, (( Guy, bring the device to me, I can end this now. ))

On one knee, with stars madly fluttering across his vision and his thoughts mostly a disjointed mess, DarkGlow clumsily reflects that being spotted while invisible sucks more than just a little. He looks around blearily and tries to follow what's going on while mentally groping for a metaphorical exit, stage left.

_This ends, here and now._ With that, the whole world seems to freeze in place for a brief instant, and when everyone's moving again, Guy is standing next to GK. At least he's fairly certain it's GK. "Here... here you go. End this."

Another cop car stops at the opposite end of the street, two police officers bursting free and toating shotguns. "Freeze!"

Thomas snatches up the device, then leaps into the air, streaking skyward until he's at least sixty feet up. His unnatural voice booms over the street. **Attention GRAB: Retreat or the crystal will be destroyed. That is your only interest here, is it not?**

Bluejay stops her flight towards GK, while the other two GRAB members halt - Chesire still clutching his sides from the rush of pain. "Yeah, that's right," Replies Bluejay, a dozen yards from Tom.

**I am not here to arrest you,** continues the vigilante, hovering in place, wary and ready for an attack. **But this is not the place for such destruction. Go.**

Foxbat idly loads another ball into his gun, casually strolling towards GRAB. "What about the Master plan!" "I said _Freeze!_" Retorts a cop. "Shut **up** Foxbat," demands Black Diamond before looking up towards the Ghost Knight. "What're you suggesting?"

**I am suggesting you leave,** replies the Ghost, dourly. **If you feel unsatisfied, we will meet again in twenty-four hours, in the park atop the mall. But you must leave, without hesitation. Or..**

"Or nothing," replies Bluejay. "You have a deal. Make it Thirty One hours; that way there will be hardly anyone there to get in our way. Chesire!" A portal opens up before the teleporter.

Foxbat wags a finger at Team Tengu. "And then we'll see about the weapon, and Then we'll see about my Master Plan!"

The taleteller whine of an ambulance screams onto the street, the driver of the crashed car having called after a hushed advisement from the duplicate Thomas. The parametics run from their van, but halt, given all the people.

Thomas descends to street level again, setting down and handing off the device to Guy. **Get this back, right now,** he advises quietly. He turns his attention to the police, then. **This fight is over with. Are you going to try and arrest me, or am I free to aid people and repair damage here?**

Clarity lets out a soft sigh, leaning heavily against a nearby building. She's not really sure what is going to happen at this point, but she imagines getting out of here might be a great idea.

"Of course. See ya real soon... with any luck it'll just be the one of you..." Guy nods to GK, before blinking out of existence. He gets going before GRAB or Foxbat, or anyone else gets any bright ideas.

GRAB consecutively dives into the portal, Foxbat turning to say something, but is interrupted as Black Diamond simply picks him up by the belt and throws him through before stepping in herself. The police are quiet for a second before one lowers hes gun, waving to the other parametics. "It's safe!" she calls. The other officers lower their guns.

DarkGlow stands, one hand on a wall for support. Likewise, his other hand rests firmly on top of his head; it feels like that's the only thing keeping his skull attached to his spinal column. He vaguely wishes he had a third hand to rummage in his pouches for some Aspirin. _Bloody hell. We have to go through this **again**?_

The rider turns, the horse trotting towards the Ghost Knight. He pauses before the vigilante, making a light gesture with a gauntlet. **You are very respectable.** From this distance, the joints of the armor and the visor seem to be incompassed with an eerie, vaporish grey energy.

**We're a lot alike, I expect,** replies Tom, evenly. **Come with me with as much subtlety as you all can muster. I will explain the situation.**

The EMTs load the news man into a stretcher, and wheel him towards the ambulance. The normal looking Thomas approaches the pair, as does the chitin-bodied man, who seems more reluctant then the others.

Minutes later, the team plus the duplicates have been hearded into Foxbat's ruined layer. The chihuahua seems to have escaped.

"Anyone want to take bets on whether the 'master plan' is on the computer, or scrawled on paper in crayon?" DarkGlow asks. "I think the odds would be pretty evenly split either way..."

"I'd say it's a fair bet that he's done them both. Who knows?" Guy shrugs his shoulders once more, and dusts off his coat. "Well... that went rather nicely, in the end... no one's too hurt, I take it?"

While his teammates talk, Thomas stays behind a wall of silence, confronting his three alter-egos. **Who are you?** he asks. **Names can be spoken; those outside cannot hear us.**

Ming packs away the computer for the taking, as well as any disks that might be in view. "I hope to find something, at least," she says. "If nothing else, our school labs could always use another computer." She then turns her attention to the comics, "You know, I bet my sister might enjoy these.."

DarkGlow asks, "Anyone up to disarming a Coke machine?"

Guy chuckles, "She might." He looks at the Coke machine. "That thing scares me... but uh... sure... maybe we can disarm it, and figure out what the heck Foxbat was up to... or, something."

Clarity tilts her head, "Well, I think maybe we should leave that to the police. Who knows what that idiot put in there, after all. It might actually be quite dangerous to tamper with." She is now going to start inspecting the room, top to bottom. "I wonder if our good friend left any of his more personal affects behind.."

"Nathen Olms," Replies the normal looking duplicate, hands in the pockets of his jean jacket. "I was Thomas Temple," Replies the armored skull-face. There's no waver in his voice, but he can't exactly hide the rest in his eyes. "I am the vanquisher of injustice. I was once Jonathan Bellent of the Holy Brigade." This from the armored knight who stands beside his silent steed.

"Tom as well," replies the man behind the mask, smiling, using his own voice and feeling peculiarly out of place for it. "I was struck by the effect of a machine that attracts one's 'peers' from parallel worlds. We possess the device now. My team will find a way to reverse the process. Until then I am at your disposal. If you need further information, ask now. It would also be helpful to know your capabilities, and.. I honestly must add, I'm very curious about your origins."

Searching Foxbat's desk proves to be interesting; a notebook Labeled 'Adventures of Me', drawn comic book style; a Foxbat Fanclub Roster, with at least a dozen names; a coupon for a free cappachino; a snow globe depicting The Red Avenger flying through the sky, with an autograph on the bottom.

Guy has to blink. "Adventures of Me?" He shakes his head, groaning, "You know... we're gonna regret it, but we're probably gonna have to read that book..."

"How about you read it and give the rest of us a summary?" DarkGlow counters.

Nathen glances to Tom, and can offer a somewhat relieved and amused smile. "Nice to know I'm not the only dead guy here. I was starting to get nervous about my future." Jonathan Bellent nods the helmet, while Thomas doesn't reply.

Ming blinks a few times, "Oh wow! This cannot really be here.. you have to be kidding!" She is so taking that, and holding it as if it were her very life. "This is real! It's real! Real real real real!" She practically dances, bouncing up and down on her toes. "He signed it. He really signed it and now I'm holding it. You guys don't mind if I keep it, do you? I'm such a big fan, and he was the greatest!" She's so hopeless.

Guy groans. "Yeah yeah... stick Guy with the grunt work." He takes hold of the 'Adventures of Me' and draws a deep breath. With a tenuous look on his face, and the breakfast he'd had already beginning to churn in his stomach, Guy begins thumbing through the book.

The rest of the lair seems unimpressive. Except for the built-in-fridge in the wall. As well as a small armory of pingpong balls and a few gadgets, hidden under the couch.

Foxbat is not the greatest of artists. He is not the worst, thankfully. The panels depict Foxbat in glorious combat, or thrilling, awe inspiring or victorious speeches, and various acts of villainy like the illustrated plan to steal all the VW bugs in the city, an attempt to harness the power of Cheese (which proves to be non-existant, finally blamed on false advertising), a successful assault on a candy store because they had rare Belgium truffles and Foxbat's girlfriend likes those, and such. Finally, near the end, Foxbat's comic shows the previous battle at the Mall, and his severe buttwhopping of Team Tengu. Then the arm wrestling contest with Chesire cat over the Genre gun. Finally of he and GRAB striking a deal and explaining his plan: to duplicate every hero in Millenium City during Detroit Day, and causing so much chaos among the duplicates that none would stop him.

---

The sewers are not the most attractive venue, nor the most popular for meetings. Which is probably why four figures stand in a sewer tunnel, regarding each other. Thomas Temple, the Ghost Knight, has removed his helmet to reveal his face, and now stands still. "So tell me about yourselves," he says.

"I'm just me," Replies Nathen, trying not to lean on the slimey wall. "I come from a poor family, and I saw some of the most miserable people, and some of the happiest, in the lower class of society. I decided not to let society just break down for the lower classes, I want to help people." A shrug. "I don't fight crime. I don't fight at all. I go from person to person, and try to help them better their lives."

"You are Thomas Temple," Replies the chitin-faced skull. "Do you have the mind-capable father?"

Thomas nods. "Yes. How did you know?"

"As was mine." The man forms a seat of stone from the ground to sit on. "Father had insisted I keep my gifts to myself, like he did. We made it secret because it was tradition, and I listened, I didn't help anyone. And when the soviets unleashed a weapon that left radiactive gas circling the planet, I tried to help. In the collapse of the world afterwards, people with powers like I were seen as monsters or brokered for power; Father urged us not to do either, urged us to continue our lives, until they came for us. I have been on the run and delt with them at every turn." The chitin shrinks back into simple flesh, baring a face similar to Tom's. From his hands melt pieces of metal which fall to the earth. "My life is a precautious thing."

Thomas gets a knowing smile on his face. "Alright, guys. We're all going to lay low for the next day or so. I have stuff in my life that needs doing, but I want you to come with me, okay?"

The knight seems about to speak, before he pauses, and all three simply nod to Thomas. "What've you got in mind?" Asks Nathen.

"We're going to meet my dad," says Tom, leading the way through the sewers.

The sewers aren't incredibly unsanitary, since most of the city's wires are now beneath ground, most of the area is kept reasonably lit and accessable to the needed power cords. Filth and runoff are grabbed by gutters and pushed through big pipes towards sanitary stations. Still, the sewers are a place of trash and pests and dust. not the best place for Bellent's explination, but it will do.

"I was a Knight of the Holy Brigade, a chapter of the most devote warriors to the Holy French king Luke the Third. The a trio of the Brigade were detoured, and while traveling through a forest that was drenched in darkness even in day, we were murdered by something not graced by God. I was the most worthy of my comrads who were offered the chance to return to Earth and vanquish that which was not right by the hand of God in his name - foulness had crept into the world, beyond which mortal man could beat back, and that which God was yet ready to intervene himself."

**And thus,** Continues the Warrior, his movements causing the sword and mace at belt to clang against the darkness of his armor, **I went forth. But I did not bare the Holy Banner of the Lord, for if it were so, I would be an inspiration, a blatant idol that the Lord worked in the world; he did not want that. For it would show that Man had to depend on him, that they might sit back and let His soldiers purify the land and solve their problems. I sought the wicked and the foul along with that which Man could not stop. I visited them in open field and in their homes for a discussion to the heart.** This has a touch of laughter in the unearthly voice. **I could craft the elements - that which He had graced - as though they were something else; Air is a mere staircase, earth is but water, and fire is a stepping stone.**

"Are you barred from touching the living, as I am?" asks Tom, curiously.

There is a moment's silence. **Only to pull them from death's door, or ease them beyond it's threshold. It all depends on His will, and their redemption.**

"Interesting," muses Tom softly. "I've never been able to affect anyone else, with.. hmm, one or two exceptions. Living beings are off-limits, but everything else is possible. It seems you aren't so much alternate versions of my physical self as you are different takes on my nature. That might be useful data for the professor."

"All's possible," Nathen observes, strolling down the passage. Glancing over, "So France was the center of the holy empire?" Bellent tilts his helmet. **It is the center of the world.**

"Tell us about yourself," questions the second Thomas. "What are you like?"

"Me?" asks Tom, a bit surprised. A moment's reflection indicates that curiosity is probably mutual. "Well.. I'm a college student. My dad says my gifts are inherited, but all of us have something unique. I have a girlfriend, I'm majoring in Criminal Justice, and I'm part of a group of other metahumans. I used to work solo, since a year ago."

Richard Temple doesn't seem to be pleased to see his son, or his look-alikes. The man was caught in a phone call, and urged the group into a comfortable sitting room, until he finally pushes through the door to find Bellent most curiously playing with the faucet in the adjoining bathroom. After the Knight joined the others, Richard stares at his son for explination.

"Duplicates of me generated by a machine, pulled from alternate worlds, if you are to believe the creator of the device," explains Tom, tersely. "The device was used as a weapon in the recent encounter." He then smiles. "They have some interesting stories to tell."

Without complaint, Richard sits down, encourages them to speak, and listens. His face doesn't give much away. Yet Tom, having been keyed into his father, can tell when the man is not enthusiastic. "Well," He sas finally. "Interesting variations the world has went through."

"You like to sit on me and keep me quiet," observes Tom. "So I figured you shouldn't object at all to keeping three of me out of the limelight for a day or so." Shifting his attention, he directs a general inquiry: "okay, guys, who wants a beer and is both alive and legal to drink?"

"Alive and legal by which world's standards?" Inquires Nathen with a grin.

Richard, however, can only stare hard at his son for a little longer. With a shake of his head and a nasal sigh, "Very well. You've proven your point."

"Good," replies Tom, fetching a pair of his uncle's longnecks from the fridge. "I practice restraint. A lot more restraint than galloping around on a horse wielding a sword." He slips out of his black mood after a moment. "You guys got anyone like my old man at home?"

"Mm, didn't know my father much," replies Nathen. "He was a traveler." **My father was Duke of Paris. There is a resemblance.**

Taking one of the longnecks in hand, Nathen pops the cap. "If we're alterations on your nature, then what are you? Out to help your fellow man, but you do it with tooth and nail, against the face of authority?" Richard peers at Tom from the corner of his eye, a hint of ruefullness in his tone. "What have you been telling them."

"Me? I've been telling them a bit about myself," replies Tom, answering his father. "What, you expect me to keep secrets even from myself now?" He addresses himself to his questioner. "I wouldn't say tooth and nail. More that... those with obligations to society because of position or power should be held to those obligations when they stray. The era of personal honor is over, and I doubt that in ANY era, the rich and powerful held to the same rules that they enforced."

**The experience is the same,** intones the Knight. "Sounds reasonable," replies Nathen. "You like to help stop some of the rain that pours down on someone's head. I like to help teach them to stand up and hold their umbrella to keep the most dry."

"Nor am I the cops. There's a place and time for you, and one for me, and one for 'legitimate' law enforcement," replies Tom, nodding. "We each do our duty." He casts a sidelong glance at his father. "Even when we don't understand or agree with the reasons, we at least satisfy what's expected of us somehow."

Richard gets up, and walks across the room to get himself a drink. He can tell it is going to be needed for the long day ahead.
