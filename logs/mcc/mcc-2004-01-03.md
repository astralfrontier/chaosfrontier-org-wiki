# Millennium City Chronicles 2004-01-03

The events of the past day have weighed on the mind of Thomas Temple, and that mind resembles nothing so much as a fractured mirror now. Though in the past he's divorced his various facets from each other, the realization that they cannot be kept apart indefinitely has grown and grown as he's talked with his alter-egos. It's with these thoughts that he goes to meet his significant other, trudging up to her door with hands in pockets, almost precisely at the appointed time he called and made earlier. _How will this go?_ he asks himself, and the only answer he sees is the yawning abyss of the unknown stretched out before him.

Chris opens the door with a bag of trash, grinning over the tied hefty bag. She pushes it into Thomas's hands. "Here - tomorrow's trash day. Cans are in the front." Leaning over the bag, she gives the closet hero a kiss on the nose, then departs inside. The smell of cleaners wafts from inside. Chris lives in a douplex just outside of the University, shared with two other roommates. Today's apparently cleaning day.

Thomas sighs a bit, taking the bag. Obediently he disposes of the refuse before returning to the front door. "Hey, Chris?"

Leaning against an in-table, Chris is drinking heartily from a glass of water. All the furniture have been moved aside, the vacuum cleaner propped up against the wall. She turns. "Hm?"

"Any chance your two roommates could umm, take a break for about an hour?" asks Thomas. "I have some stuff to talk to you about, and probably show you, and it's sort of private." He hesitates, clearly knowing that his approach will raise questions.

This does earn Tom a little scrutiny. "Uh oh. That doesn't sound good. Should I get them to vacate the premises, or just take you up to my room?"

"Out of the whole place would be fine," says Tom. "And they'll probably appreciate it when they get back," he adds with a smile.

Again he gets the wary eye, before Chris turns and trudges half way up the stairs. "Hey! Would you guys be up to taking a break?" Cheryl pokes her head around the corner of the stairs. "Why? Tom show up?" That raises a snicker from further down the hall. "Yes, yes he's here." "OKAY, I guess we can leave you alone with Thomas." The two girls make a show of grudgingly walking down the stairs, before waving to Tom, purses in hand.

Thomas waves goodbye dutifully, following Chris. "Anyway, you'd better sit down," he says softly, leaning up against one wall, composing his thoughts. "I'm going to tell you something.." _I gave you plenty of advance warning, dad,_ he thinks, not knowing just who may be listening. _I asked you to tune in, and I don't want to be interrupted. But I'm not trying to betray you either._

No response from Father. Either he's being silent, or too distracted with his current guests. Chris looks a little worried now, sitting down on the couch. "You're normally not so dramatic, Tom. What's wrong?"

"Well, nothing's wrong, really," says the young man, smiling wanly. "A few years ago, I discovered that I had a gift. A very special gift. I could move things, just by thinking about it. I kept it a secret. I didn't want my family to get upset about the sorts of things I could do with it..." _This much is fact, if at least an attempt to weasel out of the truth,_ he observes to himself with some regret. "And my ability was changing, and improving, the more I used it. I'm quite adept, now." He stops, waiting for a reaction, knowing that above all else, some patience is called for.

Chris seems at the same time surprised, skeptical, and a little excited. Likely the last is almost a professional habit. "You're kidding. You have powers? Real powers?" She leans forward a little. "Show me?"

Smiling, Tom nods his assent, then glances at the bookshelf on one wall. "Alpha sort," he says, then stretches out a hand. The books, as one, slowly withdraw from their positions. Rapidly, then, each volume begins changing place with its neighbor, as the mass continues floating without any support whatsoever. After several seconds, he begins filing the books away again, one a second punctually placing itself back on the shelf.

After moments of silence. "Wow! Tom, you really do have powers! Wow!" There's a hesitation. "Why didn't you tell me? But you are. You did tell me. Because you had to hide it. Since this sort've thing isn't easy. But you have them and that's great! Or are you in danger?" Normally she doesn't go in so many directions at once, but excitement can do that.

"It's what I decided to do with them that presented a problem, Chris," says Thomas softly. "I wouldn't say I'm really in danger, but there are people who would very much like to know what I've just told you." He smiles a little. "I've already got something of a reputation."

Now she's calmed down, and appraising Tom very hard. "So you're... all ready a hero?" There's almost a tenseness, 'Or criminal' could have been tacked onto the end of her question, but she knows Tom enough not to be that tactless.

"Some have used that word, yes," admits Thomas with a smile. "I like to think of myself as such. I have no need to rob banks or take hostages. I have no need for money, really, and I don't particularly enjoy seeing people hurt, so I hardly think of myself as criminal material."

Chris just nods. "So... who?"

Thomas hesitates, then withdraws the safest piece of evidence he could find. It's a simple photograph, taken from his jacket pocket, that floats its way over to his host. The picture is a familiar scene - Tom's room. He's sitting on the bed, and next to him, neatly folded, is a suit of black body armor with a white, skull-shaped mask atop it.

Chris plucks the picture out of the air and holds it in her hands, studying it with a shocked expression. "No way." A shake of her head, looking up. "No way. He's you? I mean, you're him? But he's... he's ruthless. And you're... Tom."

Thomas nods. "He is. And I am," he says softly. "I can't tell you I'm a nice guy, or that my intentions are good and pure. But I can prove it. You have that photo. If I see it splashed across the headlines tomorrow, I'll know what you decided to put your trust in. But I've put my trust in you."

Chris shakes her head. "No, no I wouldn't give this to the papers. That's like stabbing you in the back." She frowns through, looking from the picture to Tom. "How did you hide it? How ... did you hide it? I mean, I know with school I havn't been around That much but..."

"I studied medicine on the side. Did you know I could take the physician's exam tomorrow and become a licensed doctor?" asks Tom. "I can't eliminate sleep, but I can purge fatigue poisons from my bloodstream. It's like getting a jolt of caffeine, only without long-term side effects. I don't need to study. I remember everything I need to. College is.. more for being with friends and people I care about, than for learning, now. There've been a few times I've cancelled on you, because of my other existence, but I've never lied to you, said I was going to be somewhere when I didn't mean it."

Chris now seems a little shellshocked. "But you... really did it. I thought I knew almost everything about you." She frowns a little. "It's so dangerous out there. I know the Ghost Knight's rep, everyone wants you locked away or wants your head... How can you do that?"

"You mean, how do I avoid getting my ass kicked?" asks Tom with a gentle smile. "Or, what could motivate me to do it?"

"Both," Chris replies quickly. "I ... yeah. Both."

"Well, avoiding an embarrassing beat-down is pretty easy. I studied fighting, a lot. I'm pretty good at it. I can heal injuries at will." Thomas smiles again, privately considering a demonstration and just as quickly rejecting the notion. "But 'why' should be obvious. I'm not out there to bust heads. I'm out there to make the world a better place, the way I can. The problems we have today are because people in power can get away with murder, quite literally. Dew Chemicals? The court case just recently?"

"Which you delt with," Chris says almost absentmindedly. She just shakes her head. "It's just... weird, Tom. I guess it's just a little... radical. I always had an interest in supers for reporting. Never thought I'd know one personally. Or even date one."

Thomas nods. "Well, one of my concerns is how you'd react to this. I don't need you to say that you're not going to avoid me, or anything. Take your time and think about what you want, what you feel, and how much you trust being around me now. If you want to hear why I've waited to tell you, I'll explain. If you don't care, I can accept that."

She sits back and runs fingers through her hair. After a minute, "Well, what made youd ecide to tell me all of a sudden?"

"You could say that I was given a vision," says Tom, vaguely. "Someone really impressed upon me what can happen if your world changes radically around you, and you've left things unspoken or undone. I didn't want to have any regrets. Not that I'm anticipating dying soon or anything," he adds with a grin. "But.. you know, the future is never certain."

She laughs a little bit. "Well I hope so. But you never know, what with you throwing yourself out there with all the bullets flying." Chris pauses. "Is _that_ how you got me the interview with Lydon Yamaguchi?"

Thomas grins and gives a thumb's up. "You're sharp as usual. If you have more questions, though, now's the time to ask me, because I'm going to clean your apartment in record time. Just point me at what needs doing."

"I think I'll hold off on the questions. I want to wait a second and let them all collect. For now..." She points upstairs. "There's a city of mildew hiding in the tiles of our bathtub wall. We've tried chemicals and scrubbing.

It takes longer for Tom to get upstairs to the bathroom than it does for him to strip off the tiling, and as each tile floats pendantly in the air, it's methodically stripped of all offending foreign matter. "I ain't doing this all the time, you realize," he says over his shoulder from inside the bathroom.

Chris laughs, following behind. "Just a one time offer, huh? Well, then I guess you can just... show me what you can do. Impress me."
