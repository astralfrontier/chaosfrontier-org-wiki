The Millenium Mall is closed. Not because it normally closes at eleven - the closing time is more towards the AM on the weekends - but something interesting happened tonight. The night manager was convinced it was closing time. The woman who assured him of the time followed him as he made his rounds, talking to the security guards and the announcers. While the majority of the workers and shoppers were baffled, by 10:45 the mall was locked down, left to the janitors.

"Hey!" Announces Guy, brandishing a pair of old binoculars, that are in need of a good cleaning. "I can see my house from here..." He nods to the others, settled in beneath the night sky, which consists mostly of streetlights. "Sooo, when're they supposed to show up again?"

Clarity shakes her head at Guy, sighing softly. She just hopes to not get shot this time. She's in no mood to let anything like that happen again. No, she's going to try to get even this time. Somehow. "They'll show up soon enough," she replies.

DarkGlow makes a sound that's reminicient of a growl. "Can't bloody wait. I'm getting hungry."

For himself, the Ghost Knight waits, arms folded, his coat blowing lightly in the subdued breeze. He arrived only recently, his analogues in tow. Now he silently stands vigil.

The lamp lights atop the mall brighten like runway flares. The night sky alight offers a nest for the swirling purple portal, made almost indigo against the starry canopy. Out drops Black Diamond, her landing sending a tremor through the surrounding topsoil. Chesire cat nimbly falls beside to tumble to his feet, while swooping above the pair is Bluejay. Foxbat calls up the rear, lit like a Christmas tree and just this moment, silent, standing off to the side but looking triumpant and ready.

The vigilante in black steps forward, unfolding his arms. In one fist he's clenching something - a crystal of cubic zirconium, either the one taken back from GRAB or a very convincing imitation. **We have a deal to make,** he intones.

Black Diamond steps forward to meet the Ghost Knight's dark eyes. "You hold the prize, so offer up some terms to hash out."

**You take this crystal. You give us Foxbat. You leave. There is a further term, which I must explain.** The Ghost smirks a bit. **This is not the original crystal, which we are keeping. This is a duplicate, a reproduction of perfect fidelity. I could make more, if I wished. Your desire for it is senseless, given that you could achieve much greater wealth through the legitimate use of your talents. However, if this bauble is all you require, it is yours. My final term is that you consider the benefit you could receive by a change in profession.**

_Sorry, gotta tell ya the benefits are few and far between, old ghost..._ DarkGlow thinks to himself. With attention elsewhere, he cloaks himself in shadow--_For all the good it did last time..._\--and teleports to another section of roof. There, he wraps shadow tightly around himself and waits for the situation to melt down. His anticipation borders on eagerness.

Clarity prepares silently, her mind readying something special, this time. Should things fail, she is quite prepared to manage. There will be no mistakes, no foolish uses of power that make her a target.

BD turns and simply looks back towards the others. "It's not simply the price," Explains Chesire, "But the theft. Something like this would be returned after a while, no harm done. As for Foxbat..." The three almost as one turn and regard the now uncomfortable villain. "Come on! We're a team. The _Master Plan_, remember?"

**You accomplished the theft. Therefore your task is done,** remarks the Ghost, softly. **If you require that pride be satisfied, then I will see to it. Otherwise, it would be a waste of your time to oppose us further.**

Black Diamond is shot a simple smile from the rest of the team members. She turns, holding out her hand towards the vigilante. "You have a deal. The faux-diamond for the loon." Bluejay flies closer, but haults to hover. "And you know, we could offer something similar, but that would be a little tacky."

"But!" Foxbat spouts, looking indignant and confused and just a little hurt. "But we're a _Team!_"

The crystal is handed over, and the Ghost Knight steps back. **Not every group of notable beings is a team,** he observes softly. **But team or not, there are better ways to satisfy pride, honor and personal ambition than petty theft.**

Ming shakes her head, trying not to laugh. So this is what it means to be a 'hero', apparently. Cutting a deal with a team of thieves that involves a worthless rock and an imbecile. (( Somehow I thought this line of work was different. )) At least no one is going to get hurt. Hopefully.

"Hey Foxbat, I dunno how to tell you this, but uh, as far as I know how it's spelled, there is no 'WE' in Team," adds Guy, as the exchange is taking place.

Black Diamond palms the fake jewel, and after peering into it's depths for a moment, she raises her eyes to the vigilante and looks thoughtful. "It's all about motivation, honey. All about motivation." Turning towards the trio, she walks back, and leaps into the portal afforded by Chesire. The powersuiter flies in next. Chesire wiggles his fingers towards Guy and Clarity, then backflips into the closing passage.

Foxbat stands for several moments silent, taking a deep breath. Then it seems as though a switch has turned in his brain, turning towards the Ghost Knight and smiling. "Ah ha! I see your ploy. You seek to let me join your ranks!" Hand rubbing his chin as he walks forward, "Yes! You're rather unsavory in your exchanges, and surely a little Grit to the name of Foxbat - with an appropriate suit change would work. Maybe I could get a long coat, and a hat - something with a daring sillouete." Foxbat continues to mime as he rambles. "A revolver-pingpong ball gun... Very dashing, very dreary - it's all the rage. And then I could be united with my greatest nemesis." A sage nod.

Thomas holds up an arm, gesturing with a finger for Foxbat to approach.

Ming can only say one thing to all that: "..." Fortunately her mask covers her expression.

_A long coat and a hat? When have those EVER been fashionable, dashing, or dreary?_ Guy wonders this as he adjusts the brim of his fedora, and tucks his hands in the pockets of his trenchcoat. "Er..." is all he manages to say at Foxbat's revelation. "Uh..." he adds, quite helpfully.

The dastardly villain almost skips towards the outstretched hand, his Amazing pingpong ball gun holstered. It seems he's gone from betrayed to positively teeming with hyper energy, haulting before the Ghost Knight with a smile that broadcasts all the heroic visions flashing through his deluded little mind.

Like a black lightning bolt, the Ghost Knight grabs Foxbat by the throat, and presses one foot down on the surface beneath him. Five sharpened talons of steel emerge from the fingers and thumb of his other hand, which hovers perilously close to Foxbat's face. **Shut up,** he advises, calmly.

Clarity simply can't believe it. He's totally out of his frigging skull. (( Does this mean I should let him have his comics back? Or maybe that'll just cause him more problems.. Or. )) She stops that once it looks like Ghost Knight might rip out Foxbat's throat.

The knight atop his steed stirs from the deathly silence about him. The armor clanks and the horse snorts. Nothing need be said, but the otherworldly warrior is certain that the Ghost Knight is aware he's being scrutinized.

DarkGlow casually strolls over to GhostKnight and Foxbat, taking a flanking position behind the villain, aiming to be visible only to the corner of Foxbat's eye. With arms folded across his chest and a smirk invisibly spreading beneath his hood, he allows tendrils of shadow to flicker about him as he attempts to project menace. _Or impatience--either would work..._

Rather then knee-quivering fear or even unquestionable uncertainty, Foxbat offers forth only puzzlement and a touch of curiousity. The claws aimed at his face are an interest, but he choses to remain silent - as requested - lifting eyes from the daggers up to the Ghost Knight questioningly.

Guy decides to shut up for a while. It's best not to say things when the Ghost Knight is flicking his claws out, and uttering Shut Up. _Hmm. I wonder what kinda vending machine he's gonna have attack us this time?_

The talons snap into nonexistence and GK takes a firm hold on Foxbat. **We're going to meet the professor now,** he says, **and see about ending this unfortunate business.**

"Marvelous!" Professor Blake announces when he hears the news. His machine has been returned to him - despite the situation. However, the man is alarmed when the Ghost Knight shows him the contraption. Which is a neon blue, with LEDs. "Who added all these switches? And lights? And... Who painted it!?" Foxbat says defensively, "Well, it didn't look like an _real_ device. Presentation is important you know."

**I have some additional data for you,** reports GK. **But that can wait. The principal concern is returning the analogues that this device has created. What do you require, and how long will it take?**

Clarity sighs audibly. She really has little else to say at this point. At least partially due to the fact that she doesn't want Blake to pay her any mind. Foxbat is going to require some very skilled therapy.

Blake regards the device and peers out the window to the three duplicates on his lawn. "Well, an alternative cannot make another alternative - they are not native to this dimension, and thus if pulled by our gravitation, it will only disrupt their current placement, and set them to..." A frown, "Their 'default'. All it takes is hitting one with the device, and they are returned."

**Then please proceed. The device is yours thereafter, and while I understand that this experience has been disruptive, you will not be without compensation.** The Ghost radiates an aura of satisfaction, if that's possible. He seems genuinely happy about something.

Guy blinks, "It CAN'T be that easy... can it? I mean, geez, ya just shoot one of them with the device and it sends them back from whence they came?" The detective sounds rather incredulous. "Are you sure? Seems like it'd be more complicated than that."

(( I hope this fool is right for a change. )) Clarity sounds doubtful, really. (( No way to find out but to try. And no way to find out if we've sent the doubles to their death unless it fails utterly. ))

(( If they are me, then that is a risk they accept, )) replies Tom, mentally. (( We don't lead this life for our health. ))

Blake hoists up his contraption. "In comparison to the complexity of 'shooting' someone and making someone similar appear in turn?" He walks out onto the lawn, and hoists it up. For a moment his toy bobs back and forth, before the azure beam - although less intense then when the zircon is mounted - lances forth and strikes the other Thomas Temple. Lightning scathes across the lawn, tearing up the grass as the target fades from sight. "Well, it works," He concludes.

(( Perhaps, but that does not mean I have to like it. )) Clarity's thoughts drift to quiet as she waits for this business to be officially over. Hopefully no one else will steal this odd toy.

_As long as the damn thing is pointed away from me, I don't care where it's aimed._ DarkGlow thinks to himself. After a second, though, the thought of Ambiance or Daniel or the other DarkGlow--_Especially her._\--in its sights does cause a twinge of uncertainty. Shaking his head, he glances out the window. "Apparently," he comments, "but somehow I don't think that was the safest testing method you could have chosen."

Blake continues, as he aims at Bellent. "With the zirconium in place, it stopped the swapping of an alternative with another, and allowed due to refraction for a triplicate to appear. With the zirconium removed," He fires, and Bellent melts away, his steed turning to mist as the knight disappears, "There is no alternative for the duplicate to swap with, so they return where they belong. I was perfectly sure it would work."

Guy blinks, "Huh. It looks like it's working just fine. And it doesn't _feel_ like the fabric of the Universe has been torn asunder..." Guy breathes a sigh of relief, "So uhm, what happens to the thingy after you're done?"

DarkGlow shrugs and leans back against the nearest wall. "The device vanishes and Blake forgets all about it. Or it doesn't vanish, the military or some other super-powered villain learns of it, and then _Blake_ vanishes."

Nathan gives a wave towards Thomas and the others in the house. "See you guys. Wish I could've stuck around a little while longer. But I've got things to do back home." He smiles, and Blake holds off a moment for the exchange of pleasantries, before, "Ready. Set. Go." And fires. Olms desolves with the characteristic blaze of magnetism rippling the electrons and sending the un-even air clawing to stablize itself with electricity. "My poor lawn."

Clarity hmms at DarkGlow and shakes her head. (( We could destroy it. I do not think we're quite ready to travel to other dimensions. Our race is having enough trouble getting this one in order. ))

GK smiles. **There are worse prices you could have paid during this affair, Blake. Consider the scrutiny the FBI might have paid to you, and this case, had they become involved before us.**

DarkGlow regards Clarity shaking her head. "What? You think it shouldn't be destroyed? Frankly I'd be more than a touch surprised if Cheshire Cat et al don't at some point have a laugh about this whole mess over a pint at the local villains-only bar. And then it'd be open season on the professor."

"Or super villains, or the works. Heh. Imagine if some loon had gotten ahold of this device, used its powers to summon an army of heros from alternate dimensions, managed to brainwash them and start conquest of our world?" Guy gives a bit of a shrug, "Well, or, uhm, you know, not."

A nod of his head to the Ghost Knight as the professor enters the house.. "I'm quite thankful that you happened to be where you were when you were. Something much more sinister then the fop might have gotten their hands on it. I've learned my lesson..." He pauses to peer towards Guy. "The _thingy_ will travel with me to a place with higher security. I and my colleagues over the summer will be doing further tests and research under better protection, so we are sure this whole mess does not continue again. Hopefully we will have something of reliable dimensional travel by then."

Clarity just sighs. She's rather tired of arguing this point, so she's not even going to respond verbally. She's rather used to using her link. (( So where to now? Back to the Tengu Lair? This mask is making me itch like you wouldn't believe! I didn't think it'd be so distracting.. )) And yes, she's joking.

"Speaking of which," Blake begins after a moment. Seeming uncomfortable, "I have a request..."

**Speak.**

(( Yeah. Well that's why I don't wear a mask. That and y'know, my beautiful face and all. )) Guy gives a silent shrug of the shoulders, "And if our means of reliable dimensional travel means we get invaded by monsters from another dimension?" (( Oh hey we should get pizza. ))

DarkGlow looks askance at Clarity, then deliberately turns away from her. _Fine, ignore me. What do I care, anyway?_

"I am grateful you returned this to me. And because of that, well... I'm not very creative," explains the professor, "And the technical lable for this is a little mouthy, and not a catchy acronym. So, would any of you like to offer a more catchy name for this?" Foxbat opens his mouth, and Blake glares it shut.

Without hesitation, the Ghost Knight responds to Blake's request. He does so, of course, by turning to Guy expectantly.

Clarity is glad it's Guy's choice. Since 'pain in the ass' isn't very catchy, either.

"Hmmm. I'd call it a 'Trans-Hyperdimensional Interface Nexus Group Yield' Device?" Guy nods, "Yeah, that sounds fine and dandy to me."

Guy looks around at all of the others, raises an eyebrow, "What? Whaaaat? Why's everyone lookin' at me?"

---

**... That's right, we got our hands on Foxbat. We intend to rehabilitate him. Or I intend to, and Clarity and the others may assist me as they wish.** Thomas is on the radio to Lydon, out of earshot of Foxbat himself. **Curing supervillains may look very good for you, so I am requesting support in this matter.**

"I'm impressed," returns Lydon. "But what is it you're asking me for? A place to hold him for the time being? Press? Me physically transporting him?"

**A place to hold him would be adequate. Something secure and out of the way,** replies GK. **We'll take him to the warehouse until then.**

DarkGlow sighs quietly. _He'll be of more use as mulch, I think, but somehow suggesting it seems... impolitick._

"Dark Glow, I realize you are rather unaware of my relationship with others in the university, but next time please do not expect me to speak in front of my colleagues. Even a complete idiot like Blake would notice my voice." Clarity sighs and stretches, "In any case, you should stop resisting the link. I don't see how it is dangerous to you. It makes it far more difficult to communicate in a pinch. And I think we should destroy the device."

Guy grins, "In that getup? I don't think it's your voice he'd be noticing..."

DarkGlow considers and discards a succinct 'Piss off'. Instead, he reigns in his temper to the point where he sounds almost amused. "Your wish is my command, my lady--oh, wait, this is the real world. Grow up. You don't want to be caught up by an entangling shadow-whip, I'd rather not be caught up by a mind leash or whatever the hell it is. Leave it be."

"Unlike you, Dark Glow, I am capable of telling friend from foe after a while." Clarity turns to Thomas, rather tired of wasting her time, (( So exactly how are we going to help our friend here? I must remind you that the psychology courses I've taken were all introductory. I could brush up, but this doesn't look like a good beginner's project. ))

Guy ducks back a bit, staying out of the line of fire... for now. "Now now kids, let's calm down here. I'm sure the two of you can work things out without stabbing each other in the eye... or, at least wait 'til we get the pay-per-view crew up and running... anyway..."

(( I'll assimilate psychology and you'll draw on the knowledge I accumulated. I'm a fairly quick study, )) replies Tom with a mental grin. (( We have plenty of time. ))

DarkGlow has to resist laughing. _Friend from foe? Somehow I think not._

---

Windsor County, the little brother to the big city, has quite a few cabins for rent. Some of those cabins are renovated from old farm houses, now labeled 'rustic'. One such farmhouse has a heavy, lockable storm door, leading down into a basement fortified for harder weather, just in case. On one side of the basement, a sensory deprevation tank has been set.

Clarity studies the location carefully. Noting the tank she smiles. (( He doesn't miss much, does he? )) She clears her throat and says, "Well, here we are. I imagine you have a good plan, Ghost Knight?" (( I'm all ears at this point. ))

Only after Foxbat is safely ensconced in the tank does GK reply. **For now, we're going to give him exactly what he wants. Clarity, give him.. a nice comic book adventure for awhile.**

Clarity nods and sets to it. Fortunately she's had a lot of them to read, which gives her a great deal of material to draw upon. "I hope your plan doesn't involve me keeping this up for very long," she murmurs.

**It will be an extended process, but each session will not be particularly lengthy.** Settling in, GK now regards DarkGlow, with Guy nearby. **What did it feel like to meet yourself?** he asks conversationally.

"So uh... well uhm, I have no idea what I can do." Guy gives a bit of a shrug, "I don't suppose we can order pizza, or something while we wait?" (( You know you might wanna be careful about the comic book adventure you give 'em. Wouldn't want to warp his brain even further y'know. ))

DarkGlow stops and stares off to the side for a moment, appearing perhaps to be choosing the right words, or maybe coming up with a censored version of events, suitable for consumption outside his brain. Instead, he's attempting to weather a sudden storm of fear and anger and sorrow as the thought of NightStar and the female DarkGlow's warning intrudes upon his consciousness. With an effort, he again faces GhostKnight. His voice is tight as he replies, "They weren't me. They may have started life out as I did, but it seems I remain unique."

Thomas nods slowly, smiling. **Those I met started life, or ended it, in very different ways. And yet they all, in some way, became what I am now. Rather the reverse.**

Ming just stays focused, sending Foxbat off at the side of the Red Avenger on a complicated quest to save the world from aliens. She got it from a comic, but she's adding her own flares that enlarge the role of the delusional hero.

Guy hrmms. "Well now that's kinda interesting. None of them ended up in a different spot than you did? That's a little depressing, if it's the same for me in alternate realities... I'd hate to be stuck in that same office... if I were other mes. I'm happy where I am now. Huh. Wonder if they have good burgers."

"Still," DarkGlow continues, warming slightly, "if differences in the past can result in such wide divergences in the present, it at least implies that large changes may be possible in the future." He shrugs, laughs a little. "I guess the qeustion becomes who do I want to be?"

**That is indeed the question,** replies Tom, still quietly conversational. **I don't know how you passed time before we all met up, but you've stayed with us since, so I suppose you're getting some benefit from it.**

"It must be the attraction of a steady paycheque," DarkGlow remarks dryly. "I'm just glad no one's asked for my Social Security Number. Then again, I've not actually gotten paid. Anyone know what the pay schedule is actually like?" Enough humour eventually suffuses his tone that no one can mistake the words for anything but a joke.

Thomas chuckles behind the mask. **You realize we could all be millionaires by tomorrow, if we really wanted,** he mentions. **That's why I feel confident doing what I do, at least. You can bribe a police officer. You can bribe an FBI special agent. But what do you or I need with money?**

"Well see, I think we get paid just after those guys on their four horses ride through and we defeat them. I think." Guy shrugs. He looks at Thomas, thinks better of asking just how they could be millionaires, decides to leave the brooding to the professionals.

Ming adds a little flourish to her illusions. Might as well make Foxbat's therapy self-helping. She adds herself in the default 'mentor' role. Might as well try to build up a relationship with the patient. Even a completely made-up one might be of some aid.

DarkGlow answers quietly: "Be left alone. Give me a million bucks, a decent interest rate, and a little bungalow out in the boonies somewhere, and I think I'd be sorely tempted just to spend my days contemplating my navel."

**Even if I had that freedom,** replies GK softly, **I don't quite think of myself as interesting enough to occupy my attention for the rest of existence. However, I am glad you are here, rather than doing that.**
