# Millennium City Chronicles 2004-01-07

Holmes Security of the Home agency is a square little two story building on Vine street near the edge of the city center. Monday morning has brought a little over a dozen workers in, but almost all are on the first floor. A sparse three are on the second, all in one room. Observations prove that the room is very simple: a desk, two chairs, a filing cabinet, and the three occupants. However, in further inspection, one of those are behind a screen, a false wall.

"Well then, looks like this'll be the part where we walk into an ambush, and the guy makes his 'Thank you for delivering blah blah blah to me' or 'I couldn't have done it without your help' speech." Guy grins wryly, "Just so you know." He nods to GK, "I'm ready to go in when you are."

The presence of two more men in the office won't attract that much attention, even if one is a local private detective and the other is an older man with distinct European features, carrying a heavy bag and dressed in black armor with a long leather coat. They enter, mundanely enough, and make their way to the second floor.

The second floor is empty - as the Knight's scan proves - sans the trio in the third room down the hall. The door is unlocked, and swings open. The two chairs are simple things of plastic and wire, before an unremarkable desk, set upon which are several manilla folders. Seated at the desk is a man who looks in his later thirties, the ghost of time having brushed the hints of gray into the hair that his reducing hairline hasn't consumed. Simple spectacles sit on a european nose, framing the wrinkles and the sharp, alert grey eyes that alert when the door is opened. He wears a denim vest over a simple white shirt. Behind him is a woman in smart, yet casual business clothes, seeming more alive and yet just as quiet, paused behind the man's shoulder.

The man at the desk smiles to himself, amusement a shadow across his features at the sight of the Ghost Knight. He offers a gesture to the chairs in front of him.

Thomas strides in, calmly and confidently enough, with Guy next to him. He declines to sit, instead turning his head to look - if the wall were not in the way - directly at the face of the room's third, concealed occupant. "Won't you join us?" he asks.

Guy stands next to Thomas, a bemused expression on his face as he notes the older fellow. _Probably the Prof's decoy. Or somethin' like that._ He rocks back and forth on the balls of his feet, waiting, ready for anything. _But knowing the professor it's more of the same, 'this too was expected...' junk. I should've eaten a better breakfast._

A simple nod of his head sends the woman around the desk to close the door. "Like clockwork," Observes the man in a voice all too familiar to the Knight. "Fernando." The wall slides open like a shower door, in striding in a man of latin decent, tall and wearing a long coat. The professor turns his head to GK. "Good to finally meet you. I didn't expect you would track me down this soon, but oh well."

Thomas tilts his head, almost curiously. "You underestimate us, then. Not a casual mistake to make in your line of work. What is your business with us?" he asks, bluntly, coming to the point.

The Professor leans back. "Are you a poker player?"

"I know of the game," replies Thomas, calmly enough.

A nod from the desk-bound man. "Good. Because I want to lay all my cards out on the table."

"Gonna lay out all of your cards? Even the aces up your sleeves?" Guy regards the fellow, a look of disbelief on his face.

"Those don't count. I am Professor Maximilian Moriarity. I've spoken to you before, when you pulled Shawntae from my grasp. And when dealing with the Dew Chemicals situation. But I've been watching you a long time before that." A gesture to Guy, "I like to keep several eyes and ears and mouths in key places."

"When you started out, I watched you out of fear. And, I still do. Because you potentially are one of the biggest threats to my organization to date. However, you are at the same time, one of the most potential assets. For that reason, I made it a point to influence what you do. For instance, Team Tengu."

Thomas replies, slowly. "If we are the type of people to resent influence, then we who were formerly not a danger may become one, in response to your actions. Reflect on this."

_Gloat gloat gloat, threaten, gloat gloat gloat._ Guy has a rather annoyed expression on his face as he listens to the Prof. prattle on. "Okay... y'know, I'd wonder how else you've influenced, but you're probably gonna say it anyway."

"You will be a danger, it's merely a matter of time. At the very least, I accomplished one or two of my goals." A sideglance to Guy. "What do either of you think I want?"

"If we knew, confidently, we would not be here," observes Thomas. "Please, continue to lay out your cards."

"Right. So far all I've seen is a few twos and fives. And then the jokers." Guy waits, patiently to learn more.

Moriarity points at Thomas. "I want what he does."

Thomas chuckles. "Difficult, but not entirely impossible. And how would you go about attaining that?"

"I suppose how is one question to ask, the next question would be... why? Unless you're powermad," Replies Guy, after several moments of thought.

Moriarity smiles ruefully. "I want those in power to be held accountable for the crimes they commit. I want to stop crime, corruption and the suffering of the innocent. Impossible to attain?"

Thomas says, "Not impossible. Difficult. And what methods do you find preferable?"

Guy says, "What he said. And how would you use powers like his to aid your plan?"

"I have no superpowers. I have no nack with gadgetry, nor stomach for actual violence. So I can't go your way." Moriarity leans back. "The police, the FBI, they work hard in this city. But there are certain boundries that they cannot cross, namely the law. That, and there are circles they cannot pierce, information they can't receive. Factions in this city want to control it by force, by corruption and power, and I want to control the underworld of this city so I can stop needless crime as much as possible, so I can irradicate the most dangerous of criminals, and turn them over to the authorities with the proof they do not have the capability to find."

"So how would you be any different than the people you'd be deposing, for all your little schemes and manipulations and control? Even if you got rid of all crime, what makes you uniquely qualified to control the underworld?" Guy shrugs, _I bet he's got an answer prepared. And it's gonna be another speech._

"Look at your teammates," replies Moriarity, staring hard at Guy. "Ask the same questions of them."

"The principal qualifications for holding a position of power are ability and virtue," says Tom. "Ability can be measured, tested, quantified. Virtue, barring wide-spread telepathy, is harder to measure. But one advantage of having powers, such as the ones I possess, is that there is very little leverage that can be exerted against me, to persuade me to act in a given fashion. I have no need for money; I can create what I need at will. Are you similarly incorruptible?"

Guy says, "Yeah? Are you?"

"Wrong," offers Max. "What you really are, behind all of your smoke and mirrors, is a potential threat to you and the people around you. You will protect those around you, and under duress, may do things you don't want. As for me, I have money, at the moment I have more money then I care to have. I've lost what I wanted. Now it's a matter of making sure the same doesn't happen to others." He glances towards Guy. "I am aware of my hypocracy. A criminal who hates criminals. Breaking laws to stop those who break them. And I'm not a good man. But, there are those who are far worse then I who want the power I have, and who could have it. I see myself as less dangerous than what could happen."

"And I see you as someone, who thinks he's able to pull all of the strings in his own little world. All for the greater good of the rest of the world, of course." Guy pauses, "What would you do about those who are... potential threats?" There's that, 'I don't believe a word you just said' tone in Guy's voice just about now.

Moriarity simply smiles. "I pointed you in the direction of Mr Snake. Are you telling me you don't want him out of town?"

Guy says, "No, I'm not telling you that. I'm just asking what you would do. In effect point someone at him and hope someone else takes care of him? What would you have done if I refused?"

"The point is, I didn't expect you to. And you didn't." Moriarity gestures to Thomas. "And when you dug further and found out what was going on, three things could have happened. You send the information to me, you get your team in on it and handle the situation, or you alert the police. Your skills are far more then capable of evading most firearms, and you wouldn't have simply dropped the ball and left it alone."

"Because," continues the Professor, "You're a down on his luck detective with lots of debts, but really, you're a good guy moonlighting as a superhero and want to put the bad guys in their place."

Guy says, "So where does he fit in all of this?" Asks Guy, gesturing back to GK. "Why point me at him?"

"Because I could do the exact thing I just outlined. You're a detective. He has many skills up that alley. More then likely anything I gave you, your team could solve, or you could at least investigate and get information for me. Which brings me back to you." Moriarity turns to the silent Tom. "My last card. I want to give you three options."

"One," He extends a finger. "You work with me. This is the least likely option, but I put it out none the less. Two, we leave eachother alone. I don't watch you, or send you information, you get out of my business and don't undermine me. Three, you come after me and mine, and I do the same. I want you to be aware, with option two, there will be some partial reprecussions. With three, it will be very dirty, especially for you, Ghost Knight." He looks closely at the unmasked man. "I do not like threats. But I promise, Richard would not be happy."

Fernando looks tense. The woman looks anxious, but otherwise cool and collected. They wait, like bundles of nervous energy behind Moriarity.

"My answer depends on a counter-question," says the Ghost. "You know much that is not your concern. I ask in return for you to submit to a method of verification that, to my knowledge, cannot be counterfeited. Submit to telepathic examination of your motives - only - and I for one will comply."

Moriarity considers this a moment. "I have kept your identity concealed, and plan to, unless it proves neccessary. I expect the same in return." The woman behind him frowns, even turns to touch his shoulder. He simply watches Thomas.

"We are not journalists," notes GK, with a hint of contempt. "Our interest is in safety, not publicity."

"Fair enough. I'll have to talk to the telepath in question, and make sure all parties agree on this. Nothing else is looked over." After a moment, Moriarity regards Thomas. "Unless you possess that gift too?"

The hawkish face widens into a shark-like grin, but Tom himself makes no reply. _Let him worry,_ he reflects.

---

The parking garage is not the most secretive or sophisticated places to have done the transaction, but it is secluded enough. The building is relatively empty, other then the mountain of cars and a few people milling on different levels. They were given an exact time and place: 10 PM, level three, space 36. A corner space, and with a large van parked beside the space, it's next to impossible to see into the man-made nook.

At the appointed time, a four door Chevy truck pulls up, the windows tinted in the back. The driver and passanger to trained eyes appear to be thug material, while appearing like an out of town couple, recognizable as Fernando and the woman from earlier. From the back steps a man that appears to be in his earlier thirties, face clear of wrinkles and blemishes, though a hint of stubble. The hair is in place, the glasses gone, but the square of shoulders and posture, not to mention the firm grey eyes announce who it is, even if the dull hiking boots and jeans might throw the unobservant off.

In the niche, the Ghost Knight and Clarity - unrecognizable as their ordinary selves - wait patiently. The time has passed for shows of power or attempts at intimidation; while discretion and the protection of one's identity from casual inspection is a priority, Thomas himself is convinced that trust demands restraint.

Moriarity strides into the parking space, while the truck parks in a space several paces away. His scrutinizing eyes move from Ghost Knight to Clarity, and the shadow of a smile twitches across his lips. "Good evening."

Thomas gestures in invitation. **Your real name, please. It is a prerequisite for the contact that will be established. You will be aware of the contact, and may voluntarily break it at any time.**

A nod, and the man extracts a piece of paper from his pocket. A quick swipe a pen, and the paper is passed to Clarity. The name reads: James Watson.

Clarity nods to the man, reading the name with her usual care. She will then put it to the test, trying to open a channel into the man. "It is a real name," she says simply, "And our friend has a rather good head on his shoulders, it seems."

James's mind is very well structured: He is very well organized. Clarity's mental eye roves through the filecabinets of the brain, finding what she wants. His wife was gunned down in a failed bank robbery that was interrupted by a super, and James took a bullet in the pelvis. The quitting as his job as the second in command of an accounting firm. The dedication of working into the underbelly of the city's crime. Making connections. He wants to be in control all right. But the simple determination is stamped everywhere: hatred for what goes on.

"You have my condolences, Mr. Watson," Clarity says softly. She frowns in thought, hidden behind her mask. She continues scanning around, trying to learn anything of use that she can. From time to time she sends information along her mind link to Ghost Knight, keeping him aware of what she is finding.

For his part, the Ghost waits, patient as the grave, saying nothing.

Moriarity simply nods. There are some areas Ming simply can't reach, finding too much resistance. Though, as she pushes through, something does fall into her lap. The sight of a dead man, stabbed in the back, a costume of grey and black. Earlier memories prove that he could become like mist, slipping under doors, or become almost invisible. Then the sight of Dark Glow in an operation table, and finally a small room with several moniters and switches. The overall idea is that Moriarity believes he is rehabilitating criminals, or at least putting them to much better use then what they are doing.

Clarity finds the impression Moriarity has been watching the Ghost Knight for some time. He is concerned, and fascinated at the same time, because he believes the Ghost Knight is very much like himself. DarkGlow is a wretched thing that he hopes can either serve a better purpose, or might actually do something worth the effort, exposed to Team Tengu. Guy is an odd duck, and Moriarity hasn't put a final opinion on the gumshoe, even though there is the underlaying desire to take the poor detective out for a bite to eat, but such could never happen. Lydon he respects in a detatched sense; the man is a humanitarian, and is attempting what Moriarity wants, but on a smaller scale. There are indications that Moriarity may know Lydon, or Lydon's work a lot better. As for Ming or Clarity, he has just became aware of her.

Ming breaks off the contact, sharing all she can with Ghost Knight. "I think that is enough," she says simply. "We are not so different, it seems. Save in the reasons for our actions." Ming is still not sure just what her reason is. Doing good is enough for now. Hanging out with super heroes is a bonus. She still doesn't see herself as one, though.

Moriarity nods, and has a discomforted expression. "I'm not used to mental connections. It leaves an odd feeling, almost like a head cold." With a dismissive shake of his head, eyes turn towards the Ghost Knight expectantly.

**What is it that was done to DarkGlow?** asks the Ghost at last, directing this to Moriarty once he's considered the images and knowledge received from his colleague.

This inacts a frown. "I could tell you everything. But I suspect you'd get more out of it talking to him. Telling him you know something, and it's source will likely get him interested and open, rather then bringing all the information to him and daring him to act next."

**Very well.** GK frowns for several seconds. **You have my cooperation, and that of any who agree with me.**

Clarity, for her part, simply listens. Her issues with Dark Glow are not going to be shared at this point. For now, that case is filed away as hopeless. Only time can change that.

"Good," Replies Moriarity, turning back towards the truck. "I'm glad we are taking the peaceful route, Ghost Knight. I am glad. We'll see how things progress from here." With that, he climbs into the Chevy, and is gone.

Once the vehicle and its occupants are gone, Tom slowly and deliberately removes his helmet, turning to look at his partner. "What do you think, Teach?"

"I don't really know at this point. He seems like he'd be a good friend, but he's been through a great deal. I can only hope it doesn't turn him to bad solutions." Clarity sighs softly, removing her mask. She adds, "This thing really itches."

Thomas laughs a bit. "My armor used to sweat a lot, and it still does a bit. I got so used to filtering perspiration out with my abilities, that I mostly forgot about it. But if it ever stops a bullet meant for you, you'll never mind itching again. Shall we go?"

"I think it's time to get out of here. Besides, you have to get your assignment ready, unless you actually got it done." Clarity stretches and sighs, "And I have to get ready for more grading."
