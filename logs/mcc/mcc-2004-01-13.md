The top of Mulholland Tower isn't frequently visited by the citizens of Millennium City. Indeed, it's not strictly accessible for most people. There are some who find it trivial indeed to reach, and three such beings are now gathered, at the invitation of one. The Ghost Knight is hunkered down, crouching on the roof and observing the scene, as Guy Neville and DarkGlow arrive in their respective fashions.

"Hey... I can see my house from here." Guy has simply teleported up to the top of the building, with a rather curious expression on his face. There's certainly a nice breeze today, as evidenced by the flapping trenchcoat the detective wears. "So what didja want GK?"

DarkGlow wraps his cloak more tightly to shield himself from the wind and, looking down, comments dryly, "There are times I think flying could be fun..."

Stepping back and shrugging, DarkGlow finishes, "...but the law of gravity isn't really the bendable kind."

**I'm glad you're both here,** comments the vigilante, rising from his crouch and turning to regard his 'guests'. **I've spoken with someone. The Professor. Maximilian Moriarty. Another name, as well. I asked him a question, DarkGlow, and he recommended I ask you instead.**

DarkGlow casually saunters a bit closer to the nearest shadow--and on the bare top of the tower, that would be Guy's. Somehow successfully reusing GhostKnight's shadow to escape GhostKnight's own possible ambush seems unlikely. _This could get interesting, with definite Chinese overtones..._ "Oh, really?"

"Ah the prof. Good old monkeyface. Ahem. So er, what'd you want me up here for, if you've got to ask Darkglow over here the question?" Guy shifts a bit, as the assassin saunters over to stand in his shadow.

**Because you were sent by this man. The question I have, DarkGlow, is.. were you sent by him as well?** The question is casual, without a hint of accusation.

"The bastard who delivered me that letter while I was in civvies? No." DarkGlow states this flatly. "And like I told you, if you want help taking him out, I'm your man."

**No, the guy who put you on a table.** The Ghost actually smiles now. **The one who wanted to rehabilitate you.**

"Hmm. Well now, I hadn't heard about this... someone put you on a table, DG?" Guy looks at the Shadowy Figure standing sort of nearby now, wondering. "Boy he really does have his hands in everything."

"Rehabilitate?" DarkGlow barks a laugh. _Heh. Funny man._ "No one wants to rehabilitate me. Besides, what's to rehabilitate other than a little light larceny coming out of the orphanage?"

**I think that you were sent, just as Guy was.** The Ghost turns slightly, training his attention on the detective. **What is it you were sent to us for?**

Guy explains, "Me? Well I was sent to gather information on you and your team, such as it is. Of course, I ended up just bs-ing the guy, so..."

The skull's empty eyesockets regard DarkGlow next, silently waiting.

_Alleviate suspicion by pleading guilty to a lesser charge, huh? Someone should tell that rule to skullface._ DarkGlow shrugs again. "Believe what you want, but I'll generally take a bungalow in the boonies over getting shot, stabbed, mauled or blasted by some mysterious ray coming from your average super-powered bad guy. Say the word and I'll start looking over real estate listings; I can practically hear it calling to me now." _And bugger if I really don't, the way these last weeks have been going. Just check out and have done..._ DarkGlow is surprised to hear a sigh of longing issuing from between his lips.

**On the contrary, I have found you to be competent and useful. Nor am I particularly interested in putting you or anyone else, myself included, into anyone's line of fire.** The black shape extends a hand. **Whatever you have done, whatever this man thought he would purge out of you, you have been a benefit to many, many lives thus far. Let's continue to be useful.**

Guy nods, "This is true. And hey I'm all for continuing to be useful..." muses Guy, shifting his attention back and forth between the two. "And the Skullface is right, like it or not, you've been really helpful, and saved a buncha lives."

DarkGlow laughs softly, but makes no move to accept the hand. "Oh, there are demons to purge--I think you've seen enough of me to know that, and well. But silent meditation is the best way to wrestle the likes of them, not brawling on some streetcorner. Brawling just heats the blood until your brain is practically useless, and my brain is the only thing between me and..." _And...? And what? Anarchy? Humanity? Civility? Come off it, killer._ He shrugs once more. "The death of that which truly make me who I am."

**Brawling is the least graceful method available to us,** remarks Tom, withdrawing his hand slowly. **If you want suggestions for better methods, I have them to offer. I understand Mr. Neville. I understand Clarity. Lydon Yamaguchi is an open book. But I do not yet understand you.** The voice is emotionless, but something in the words suggest that this is the crux of the matter, the true reason why three men stand atop the tower roof in the sun.

DarkGlow shakes his head slowly. "I have the tools I need. If they are not of the quality required, then it is my own fault. And if they are insufficient to the task, then nothing in this world will suffice. If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you're much of a mystery to me and it gives me little comfort. We come from different places, and will end in different graves, but for now it seems we walk together. And that I think I do find comfort in."

Guy scratches his head, listening to DG. "Well, I suppose so. But you know, you can always ask others for help if ya need it. After all, it's what we're here for. To help make the world better, or somethin' like that. May as well work together, share the burden y'know."

DarkGlow is strongly tempted to clap Guy on the shoulder, but refrains. "I know, and I appreciate the offer. I just wish ghosts were susceptible to a little detective work, wire-wrapping and super-speed punches. My demons can only be laid to rest by me."

Guy chuckles, "Says you. You'd be surprised at what an unlicensed nuclear accelerator strapped to one's back can do for ridding yourself of Ghost problems. Busts them up quite nicely..."

**Ghosts are laid to rest when what they want has been satisfied,** replies the black knight softly. **They are compelled to roam only as long as they haven't been heard through. I would think detective work would be just the thing.**

DarkGlow turns back to GhostKnight, and his vision spins for a moment. Giddiness rises in his throat. _Can you get drunk on comraderie? Fine then... let's see if a detective and a pseudo-corpse can sort this out. But will my phantom friend let me?_ "Something's been messing with my shadows, once somehow stopping me between shadodws, and another time redirecting me to a different location. It's sent me images too, violent murders, and wild impluses. I'm afraid this ghost is a bit more literal than perhaps I've previously implied."

**I see.** The vigilante is now all business; his father's tales and suggestions of a darker layer underneath the history of Europe and the old world have made him cognizant that not all truth is found in science, and he does not flinch at this notion. **We will help. Will you accompany me?**

"Oooh. A ghost story. Huh. Well I suppose then that we ought to help. This certainly does sound concerning, let's see what we can do for you then." Guy smiles, and ponders the Ghost Knight, "Sounds like you've got something in mind already..."

**I have several things in mind. Let us see which of them pay off.**

DarkGlow glances away, pretending to consider. _Away from your rather well-chosen ambush spot? Gladly. I just wish the giddiness had lasted a touch longer, and that dread and foreboding weren't now rushing to replace it._ Turning back, he tell the other, "All right. Don't suppose we'll be stopping for lunch on the way?"

**Lunch is acceptable. Meet me at the warehouse when you are finished.** The Ghost stays silent, considering.

"I guess the undead don't need to eat or drink. Ah well." Guy nods, "So one quick lunch later, we meet at the warehouse... see ya there." Guy turns to leave, though he won't leave before this business is concluded...

DarkGlow grimaces into his shadowed hood. _So much for the light touch of humour. Should've known better. Ah, well, I can always just not show up, right...?_ "Right," he says aloud, answering himself and replying to GhostKnight at the same time. Without another word, Guy's shadow twists suddenly, and DarkGlow is no longer there.

Vanessa walks into the warehouse, wearing a chrisp suit. There's a slightly different air about her - one of almost professionalness. She looks over the place like she was analyzing it, and pushing through another door, spots the Ghost Knight. "Hey!" The facade melts away.

**I understand that due to personal matters, you have stayed out of our more aggressive endeavors, Vanessa,** says the Ghost, inclining his head. **You are a practitioner of that loosely called 'magic'. There is a ghost whose existence must be laid down. We wish for your aid.**

Vanessa walks closer, and her voice grows quieter. "I'm sorry I had to back out, but I got a call. I've spent two weeks in training. I can't exactly say what or where but, it involves the letters I, F, and B." She pauses. "A ghost? Really? Getting some experience there could be useful."

Two gloved fingers draw up, indicating DarkGlow. **He has the most direct experience with the phenomenon. Ask him for whatever details are necessary.**

Vanessa turns to DarkGlow, and offers him a smile before everything goes professional. Or at least she's trying to appear well oiled. "Okay, so, tell me what you know."

DarkGlow coughs, suddenly wondering exactly how much different a witch or whatever is from a telepath. _Oh, crap. And I thought Guy had a big mouth..._ Straight at he can, he tells Vanessa what he recalls, omitting only such things as any direct mention of shadow powers, revealing even that the images seem like memories, except he doesn't remember them. When he stumbles to a stop, a quick mental review shows mostly incoherent ramblings--which is pretty much what they feel like in his head, too, so he mentally waves it off. "Anyway, make of it what you will--though I'm more than a little surprised that I've not been interrupted yet. Maybe my phantom isn't peeking into my head at the moment."

Vanessa makes notes on a piece of paper, and looks back at DarkGlow, "Well, Peche Island is supposed to be cursed. If so, it'd obviously be a place of high psychic energy - sort've like a huge furnace of bad stuff. So if any angry spirit were clinging to you, it certainly could've clung to that place for a time being, which would mean bringing you back. But since it's stuck around, and manifesting memories... So you're sure you've never seen the memories before?"

DarkGlow laughs, but chokes it off as he hears his own answer: "Nope, not unless they were repressed. Er... Not that I think that."

The witch nods. "Okay. Then either they were repressed, or it's the ghosts own baggage. Some kind of clue to its' existance. I've read stories were people were possessed, or hallucinated, or walked into a place that looked real, but was a past impression on the place, and it lead to discovery of a body or some unfinished business. Maybe this could be a cry for help."

DarkGlow nods back. "That's what I was figuring, but whatshisface is bloody stubborn about not answering any of my questions."

Vanessa shakes her head. "To be honest, this isn't my forte. Infact, I've been seeking out some local people who've been teaching me this stuff. They'll know what to do, if you're really wanting to get to the bottom of this."

"More people," DarkGlow flatly states. It's clear he's unhappy with the prospect.

Vanessa smiles assuringly. "They're good people. A little odd... but they're the best thing this city has when it comes to paranormal knowledge and defense."

DarkGlow doesn't know who should be more afraid: him or the phantom. _Probably me._ He shrugs, fatalistically. "As you say. I've got a thing about signing my name in blood, though. Just so you know."

This causes a little laugh, but it's hesitant. Van turns to the Ghost Knight. "I need some chalk."

**Calcium carbonate. I will obtain some,** says the Ghost, departing quietly on his errand.

"For a dead guy, he sure knows about science." Van turns to Guy. "Hi."

"And just the thing for upset stomachs--hate the chalky aftertaste, though," DarkGlow mutters under his breath. _What have you to say about all this, phantom mine? Anything?_

"Hiya," states the detective, standing there, with his thumbs twiddling a bit. "So er... uh, what's with the chalk?"

Van thumbs towards Darkglow. "I need to mark him."

DarkGlow shrugs, nervousness showing. "They think my cloak will make a good blackboard or something."

Thomas returns shortly, bearing more than adequate supplies. **This should suffice. I stand ready, should you require additional assistance.**

Vanessa laughs a moment, turning to DarkGlow. "You're right. I need your cloak."

Guy says, "Uh oh..."

_Holding me down, or bashing my skull with a concrete mace, or what-have-you. Thanks, skull-face. So kind. What the hell am I doing here?_ Wordless, DarkGlow shorns himself of his cloak, his face's pale skin and hair and eyes now naked before her. He locks his eyes onto a spot on the floor.

The woman takes the cloak, tossing it onto the floor. The chalk is spread out in a slow circle that is broken. A second circle is made, joining the circle, broken on the opposite side. The chalk then turns bright white, then blows away from an unsensed wind. "All right, there you go."

DarkGlow debates saying 'Oh, of course. That makes perfect sense.', heavy on the sarcasm, but instead says simply, "I don't understand."

Vanessa nods. "They'll know who you are as soon as you walk in the door." Taking up the cloak, "You need to go to Club Incubus tonight."

"Always up for a little bar-hopping and footloose dancing," DarkGlow replies, having never bar-hopped and done precious little dancing in his life.

Vanessa nods. "It's in the Theater District. Anyways, that's all I can do to help you. I'll let them know ahead of time."

"Thank you," DarkGlow replies, in a voice grave enough to do GhostKnight justice. _So I'll probably be turning in early tonight..._
