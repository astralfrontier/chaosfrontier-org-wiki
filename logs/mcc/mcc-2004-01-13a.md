# Millennium City Chronicles 2004-01-13a

The warehouse has been refitted; the Ghost's powers have been put to use, creating obstructions, barriers, walls, niches and other complications. Now Thomas Temple waits, kneeling in the lotus position, as Guy and Ming arrive.

Ming looks around curiously at the changes, arching an eyebrow. "So we're.. hamsters?" she murmurs. She sets down a couple brown bags she's brought with her, one of which contains a 6 pack of beer. Tools of the trade.

Guy wanders inside of the warehouse looking around curiously. "So uhm... uh..." He looks around at the barriers, walls, and other obstacles. "So uhm... what's all this for? I mean, you can't really expect us to do stuff with all of this, can you? That only happens in the comics..."

**You can't see through it all, can you? Can't know where your friends are at any given moment. Or your enemies.** The ghostly voice is cold and austere, a tool for instruction. **A common problem. Clarity, the psychic connection please.**

(( Such a pushy, pushy man, isn't he? )) Ming sighs quietly, shaking her head. (( Oh, remind me to show you guys something I've been working on after this. It has a lot to do with seeing things. ))

Thomas quietly concentrates for several seconds, readying his sense of perception, then broadcasting its impressions into the collective mind. (( In the maze there are six buttons, color-coded into pairs. You must both press the colored buttons together. You have my sense of perception to guide you; you can think at each other, sharing knowledge as necessary to make it happen. After this I will ask Ming to sit out, and practice combat with Guy. ))

(( No fair that only the boys get to have fun! )) sends Clarity. (( So buttons.. we're tandem hamsters, Guy. Let's go find them! )) She will head on into the maze, wondering if Thomas went to the trouble of making this dangerous and confusing.

(( Hamsters. Okay. Well here's the thing, I have an easy solution to all of this... the only problem is I think it sorta defeats the whole purpose of the exercise... )) Thinks Guy, as he follows Ming into the Maze, (( And I doubt GK would appreciate it. My foot itches. So does my nose. Wonder if I turned off my hotplate... ))

(( Do not transmit what your teammates do not need to know, Guy. The act of sharing thoughts is voluntary. )) GK sounds a bit testy, but he's learned that tone from all the teachers he's ever known.

(( Fine, take all the fun out of it. So let's see... buttons to push... where oh where can these buttons be, where oh where can they be... )) Guy heads into the maze, letting his perception sort of fade into GK's sense of perception instead...

(( Want me to find out for you? )) replies Clarity to Guy, easily sending her thoughts just where they belong. It occurs to her all the things she could send to Thomas in the mean-time. But that can wait. She moves alone the maze, carefully making her way towards one of the buttons. She has no real means of protecting herself, save to relay what she sees. (( Keep sharing what is around you, Guy. ))

Both buttons are found, and pressed in synchronization. (( Well done, )) reports the Ghost, through the link. The process continues, with GK using his uncanny awareness to guide his companions' actions. Again a pair of relays are closed, and the third pair is found and activated without any hesitation at all.

(( No sweat so far. )) Clarity is quite pleased, though she thinks with Ghost Knight's abilities it was pretty simple. (( At least this proves that I'm useful to have around. ))

(( Yeah. Well we knew that beforehand. So uhm, you and GK are gonna fight... right? )) Guy finishes pushing the last of the buttons along with Ming, whistling oh so innocently as he attempts to remain inconspicuous. A futile attempt... but...

(( A point which did not need proving, )) thinks GK, with a hint of rebuke. (( We will continue. Meet me at the cleared area of the warehouse. Clarity, if you would be so kind as to station yourself beside the box of rubber balls you will find there. ))

(( I can't believe you thought that without giggling )) replies Clarity. She moves over to stand there, debating 'helping' the two by sending them various images. (( So, who here likes vodka, anyway? I splurged a bit to celebrate. ))

(( Reward yourselves appropriately, if we succeed. )) The Ghost leaves his perch, taking up a position almost thirty feet away from Ming, and beckons Guy to join him. (( More coordination. We must catch each ball between one of our open palms, together. If one of us is too fast or too slow, we will not have a grip. Are you ready, Guy? ))

(( Now this I gotta see.. )) projects Ming. She sends an image of Ghost Knight and Guy playing patty-cake together.

(( I suppose the lesson I'm supposed to learn here is to coordinate myself with you, instead of say, freezing the balls in mid-air? )) Guy tilts his head a bit, (( Lady, I'm so glad I'm wearing pants in that picture. ))

(( I'm not that mean! )) replies Ming. (( Anyway, this should be very interesting. I really don't know all that much about what you guys are capable of. ))

(( For now, let us see if we are capable of acting in concert, a simple enough act, )) suggests the Ghost. (( Begin throwing. ))

Ming shrugs and grabs a ball. (( Here goes! )) Well, if nothing else, this test of super hero prowess verifies one thing: Ming does, indeed, throw like a girl.

And with that the two are moving. It takes one or two tries at first, but Guy gets the hang of moving at the same speed as the Ghost Knight, and vice versa. It's not long before the two of them are able to play patty-cake with the best of them. Er, that is to say, they prove themselves capable of working in tandem, and get timing down nigh-perfectly.

Variations on the theme are played out; perhaps an hour passes before the Ghost calls a halt to the proceedings, and inclines his head respectfully. **An excellent state of affairs,** he remarks. **I hope we may continue this tomorrow.**

Ming stretches and then slumps her shoulders. (( So, you guys tired yet? )) she asks. (( This was a good arm work out, anyway. )) She stretches her arm behind her, letting out a soft sigh.

(( Yeah yeah. So uh... what was this about fighting? )) Guy manages to think nervously.

(( We'll commence combat practice tomorrow, )) replies GK. (( I have an idea I want to put into practice, but it will require time. ))

(( Come here, you two, I have something to show you that may be helpful. )) Ming settles down on the floor, smiling to herself. (( I've been working on this. It's something that occurred to me while I was last helping Foxbat. ))

Thomas nods. (( What is it? ))

Guy hmms, (( Why am I suddenly worried... ))

(( Just relax.. )) Ming shuts her eyes, and suddenly the world shifts, vanishes, and Thomas, Ming, and Guy are at the bottom of the sea. Amongst that oddity, it might not even occur to them that Ming is no longer sitting, but standing. (( If I can create a comic book reality for Foxbat, there is no reason I can't create a full training environment for us. ))

(( Impressive, )) comments GK. (( In which case I will rely on you to provide an adversary for tomorrow, with Lydon Yamaguchi's help. ))

(( Be aware that the ability of my illusions relies on my abilities, but if Lydon will join the link, they can fight with whatever skills he has. )) Ming grins, changing the illusion again, so that this portion of Team Tengu finds themselves standing on the surface of Mars. (( Sure beats a video game, huh? ))

(( Really? Hmmm... well, no, I suppose that wouldn't be quite right. Still... it's an interesting possibility. )) Guy shrugs, (( So uh, neat. ))

Thomas chuckles softly. (( That is exactly the use I had in mind for him. ))

(( You know, I should use this in lectures sometime.. )) Ming laughs softly at the thought. (( Oh, yeah.. I should drop this. )) And just as abruptly as it came into being the illusions are gone.

**My turn.** GK crouches and leaps, rebounding off the ceiling, rolling and cartwheeling upside down in a display of sudden acrobatics. He springs back a few seconds later, bearing the vodka that Ming had left near the entrance. **Enjoy.**
