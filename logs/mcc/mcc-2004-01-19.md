# Millennium City Chronicles 2004-01-19

After Chris watched in amazement as Tom removed all of the fungus from the bathroom tiles, vacuumed by means of a small cyclone of dust and grit, and swept the floor, she flops down on the couch, the pair went out for lunch. Dropping into her car, "I feel exhausted just having watched you do that."

"It's exhausting to do," smiles Tom, humming a bit. "Well, not really. I can focus on a single task pretty easily, without any effort whatsoever. It's as simple as thought. But I can wipe myself out pretty quick if I try to do a lot of things at once."

"I can imagine," Replies Chris as she pulls out. "All that concentration, multi-tasking, thoughts going in all different directions. It's like trying to have a conversation, drive, and do statistics homework." Smiling, "Don't try that, either. I almost hit a car."

Thomas chuckles softly. "I probably could, actually," he observes. "But, I still wouldn't want to try." A moment of silence passes, and a shadow is reflected over his face. "Lot of things I don't want to try."

Chris peers at Tom from the corner of her eye, and doesn't immediately pry. "With your powers, you could support yourself a hundred times over, and you could easily defend yourself if anyone wanted them, you could still be the Ghost Knight on the side. So, why school?"

Thomas smiles at that. "Why school, why date, why go out drinking Saturday night, why have friends? Why have a life?"

The woman shrugs while looking over the road. "Just saying that you are capable of a lot of things, that an education wouldn't even have to support. But considering the level of classes you're taking, I guess you're bright enough to simply want some mental challenging? Something of interest?"

"Yeah, that's part of it," admits Tom. "Another part is.. I want to be normal. That's easy for some people. For others, it takes a hell of an effort. You gotta figure out what's normal, you gotta do things that help you connect with other people, because ultimately that's what matters, right? Connecting with others, getting along."

Stopping at a light, Chris smiles over. "Just becareful about wanting to be normal. Might loose sight of what's Tom, too. So, does your dad know about the powers?"

Tom chuckles. "Hahaha. You have any idea of how much he'd freak out, if I told him what I told you?" He shakes his head. "I know this much: my dad would never approve. It would be better, I'm convinced, if he didn't know." The young man darts around the truth, managing to not actually lie, but privately convinced that this is the best way.

Chris shakes her head. "I suspect your dad wouldn't approve of you breathing if it bothered him in some form or fashion. He seems so... Stiff and controlling." She tries not to roll her eyes, rather to pay attention to the road.

"He's got his reasons," offers Tom, then falls silent. The next words he speaks are measured out slowly. "You're taking this pretty well."

Another shrug of her shoulders. "My brother's secretly a sueprhero." After a second, "Kidding." She grins over at Tom. "But, I can't exactly freak out. Not yet anyways. I havn't been in danger Yet - unless you count a few weeks ago with the mob looking after Arlene but..." She dismisses it. "I guess I'm just sort've shocked into casualness. I don't get hysterical over problems but, I'm sure as hell surprised."

Thomas nods. "Well, hopefully that event makes more sense to you now. I'm sorry about that, and... I admit, it may be a factor in the future. That's part of why I came to this decision. You deserved to know what was happening, and why, should it ever occur. But more than that, you deserved to know anyway." He smiles a bit. "That you are so surprised is comforting, I'll say. If I could keep a secret from YOU, I can keep it from anyone."

"Well, I had suspicions something was up. I didn't think you were seeing someoen behind my back, and a time or two I thought you might be avoiding me but I never dreamed about this." Chris stops in a parking space at Rockets, a Fifties-style drive-in restaurant. "What do you want?"

"Oh hell, umm. Cheeseburger, chocolate malt. My treat." Tom hangs his head a bit. "It's pitiful repayment for springing this on you, but I'll make that up in time, as I can."

Chris laughs, leaning out the car window and pushing the intercom. She orders Tom's, then for her a chicken sandwich, before leaning back. "Thanks for telling me, though; I wouldn't want to find out standing in the morgue somewhere identifying you. Though, if anyone ever comes after me toating guns or whatever, I am so kicking your ass after you save me."

"And it'll be well-deserved," agrees Tom, grunting. "Speaking of morgues, though, I'm developing something of a collection of people, who can do things I can't, go places I can't, and know things I don't. I'm not going to come out and ask you. I'm not even going to hint that it would be useful to me. I'll just flat out state that it would be, and if you ever feel like you aren't getting enough danger and unreasonable risk in your life, look me up."

"In other words, if I come across something that would be useful for you, or if I have access to the right names and dates and stuff at the newspaper or in Arlene's office, then I'm your go-to girl." Chris leans back in her seat. "That's only fair. But I want scoops. Inside information." She laughs, happy, almost evil. "It's so good knowing a secret Arlene is just gnawing at the bits to know."

"That'd be a fair exchange. But I want to be clear," Tom says, turning in his seat and staring straight at his companion. "I will never ask you to do that. I will accept it if offered, but if it is not, nothing changes, everything's cool, we're who we've always been."

Chris shakes her head. "I know you don't want to exploit my position at the paper, because you care about me. And vice versa for me to you. But it's sort've like a partnership, Tom. I can't read your mind to know what you're looking for tomorrow. And I could try to notice everything and record and remember all the stuff that comes in, just to give to you, but that might be too much on your plate. A little headsup on what you might be doing would at least be nice." A bat of her eyelashes. "Unless you just want me to gush about everything. I generally didn't bug you about work because I figured you didn't want to hear about it all."

Thomas chuckles softly. "I'm good at listening. And remembering," he points out. "My mind's designed to handle a lot of input."

"But you don't talk as much," She points out with a poke at Tom's ribs. "So tell me about this Tea-" She's cut off as the waitress hooks a tray to the car door, the food in bags. "Here's the chicken," She offers the bag, which Chris snatches, before passing the second bag to Tom. "The malt," This goes to Tom, "And the Diet coke is yours." Chris holds her hand out to Tom for the cash. As the waitress walks off, "Must be more careful about talking."

Thomas laughs softly. "Welcome to my world."

Resolved, Chris opens her bag. "So, Team Tengu. Who, what? Lydon denies it, but you keep showing up with other people."

"Umm." Tom muses for a few seconds. "There's a few people I hang out with, sure. They're all pretty secretive. So far half the group was, as far as I can tell, sent to betray the other half. So we're all still sort of getting to know each other."

Chris offers forth, "Wonderful," Before biting into the sandwich. "I'm not asking for who they are behind the mask, but who do you have? There's the blurred one way back on Renaissance Square, and the guy in the cloak. Then the guy in the trench coat..."

Thomas scratches his head. "We had one girl who's taking it easy, staying out of the way, because of personal stuff. We have one guy who does shadow stuff. We have one guy who messes with time. We have some freak who can walk through walls and scares people with a creepy voice, but you wouldn't like him anyway."

Chris laughs around her sandwich. "Well, he doesn't have a lot of nice PR, no. He needs to smile more, maybe. Or do some community service."

Thomas slouches a little. "Hey, I'm smiling," he says, and is. "Anyway, umm, as far as active line-up, that's about it. There's a couple other guys we bagged, or are helping out. We don't have a mascot. We have no headquarters or permanent address."

Chris smirks. "All a permanent address is good for is broadcasting where you can be found."

"Bingo," chuckles Tom. "Then again, meeting up at McDonald's is pretty humiliating, if you think about it. Not that we actually do that, but still.. I have pride in what I do, and I want to reflect that somehow."

Another laugh. At this rate she's going to choke, so instead she just focuses on her food. Wiping off with a napkin after the sandwich is taken care of, "Yeah. So. Out of curiousity, have you guys done anything of note that I could get started on? Snooping, scooping..."

Thomas scratches his head again. "Well, umm, let's see. We fought the New Purple Gang to a standstill. We outwitted GRAB. We have Foxbat and are going to cure him, if we can. I've personally humiliated the Chinese Mafia, who probably want to do nasty things to me now. There's the Dew Chemical business... umm, we're sort of taking it easy right now."

Chris seems to perk up. "Well, the Mafia might not like us posting stuff about them, so they're out. GRAB... eh. People like them on a whimsy. But curing Foxbat? That holds some merit right there. How're you fixing That loon?"

Thomas shrugs a bit. "We know a telepath."

"Interesting," Chris leans back. A momentary frown. "I just now realize how hard it would be for me to actually report on this stuff. Well, report on it and have any semblance of secrecy."

Thomas nods slowly. "I'll think about it. But for now, having Lydon Yamaguchi as a resource should be a good start, right?"

"Yeah, that would work." Chris pulls out. "You mentioned stuff that you wouldn't do. Ghost Knight has done some bad things, or so his rep goes. Are you keeping your self in check?" There's a certain intensity in her gaze.

"Wouldn't you?" asks Tom in a soft voice.

Chris nods. "Yeah. But I'm not dealing with the monsters day in and day out."

"You become what you are exposed to," notes Tom softly. "That's a fundamental problem in criminal justice. Bad homes breed bad kids, on average. Bad environments breed bad people. And I'd say what I do involves some of the worst environments..."

"Right," Chris stresses. "So you know you have to be careful."

"Which brings us back to why I go to school, why I want a normal life," says Tom with a smile. "Anyway, it's kind of depressing to think about. I usually keep these two umm, selves, pretty separate from each other."
