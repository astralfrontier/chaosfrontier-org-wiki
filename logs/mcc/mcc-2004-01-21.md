# Millennium City Chronicles 2004-01-21

Davron pauses above the slave-train, the volo beating its wings quietly in the pre-dawn air. His very being cries out for him to swoop down upon the slavers and lay them low... but the sheer number of the guards cautions him. Even with the powers granted him by Helios, he would be hard pressed to defeat them - and what should he do if they hide behind their captives? His heart in his throat, he turns away and flies back to his companions as fast as the volo's wings can carry him, praying fervently to the Unconquered Sun that he will be able to find them again.

The young archer's frantic flight eventually happens upon Gallius, mounted on her wylding steed and seeing to the surrender of a captured platoon of Greyfalls soldiers. He sets down beside her, and before she can even open her mouth, he blurts out, "Slavers! They... they've got..." He calms himself slightly, but only slightly, and goes on, "I, I saw someone from my village there. I, I've got to... please, Gallius, you've got to help me!"

Gallius is easy enough to find, set atop Jin-nu and looking like a star descended from the heavens to scour the earth of the Realm's lies. Davron is not the only one she must listen to, however, for another messenger has just turned away, informing her that she is needed off the walls, and swiftly. She turns to Davron, frowning in thought. "Perhaps it will be on the way, then," she says. "There are innocents in the midst of battle below, and I must aid them swiftly. Which direction are these slavers heading in? Tell me as we move!" She doesn't wait, but urges Jin-nu on, and the horse leaps easily from the wall to land below, heading further into the city, towards what appears to be a group of soldiers facing off with a larger mass of elders and small children.

Davron pauses in indecision for a moment, but the call of defending innocents - any innocents - takes him back into the air alongside Gallius, only able to keep pace with Jin-nu through the First Age artistry of his own mechanical steed. "They're headed to the southwest," he says, urgently. "I think they're trying to sneak 'em out in the confusion of the battle."

Gallius nods to Davron, vaulting from Jin-nu when the crowd draws near. She turns to the horse, "Now, go find Gari! Tell him to fan out what scouts can still ride to the southwest. Tell him that Gallius will forget her pardon if he fails! Run fast, my friend!" Jin-nu snorts, "Faster than the wind," she retorts, spinning away to run back into the chaos of battle to find the scouts. Gallius says to Davron, "They will not escape, but we cannot forget what it is we are here to do. Many will die if we abandon them now. Gari will not lose the slavers, not even in the fog of war." Already she is moving forward, easily through the ranks of soldiers who give way from her, either from respect or fear. "What is the meaning of this? Why are you not in your safe places, people of Greyfalls?" she calls out.

Tauri, the representative of the common folk in the city, stands in front of a tightly-grouped knot of the city's noncombatants, barring the way into the citadel. "Lady," he says, grimly, noting Gallius' approach, and the presence of the hovering angel nearby causes his eyes to widen somewhat. Nevertheless he continues. "Do not let these soldiers desecrate our sacred temple. Those in need of sanctuary have always fled to the citadel. It is where we commune with our gods. Our men inside would die rather than break the peace within."

Gallius nods to Tauri, "Then if your men inside will throw down their arms there shall be no desecration. We will pass by this temple." She turns to her troops, "Some of you men must remain her as guards, to see to it that my words are heeded. Any citizen of Greyfalls may enter or leave as they will, but they must leave their weapons with you until this battle ends and not raise arms against us from inside." She turns back to Tauri, "Is this as you would wish it? I do not wish to spill the blood of innocents this day. So much already wets the land."

There's some muttering among the massed Confederation soldiers, and their commanding officer speaks, breaking his silence as he eyes Tauri warily, one hand resting uneasily on the hilt of his sheathed blade. "They've got weapons of magic within, Lady," he jerks out. "Nothing will stop 'em from finding another way out, and attacking us by surprise. We have to go in, or else lives will be lost for nothing."

"Will you pledge that they will no longer fight in this battle?" says Gallius to Tauri. "You must understand our position. I would gladly accept surrenders and grant quarter, but I cannot stand around while men plot the ruin of my people. So, can I trust them to no longer fight this day?"

"That.. I am sure can be said," grates Tauri, at last, looking somewhat uncertain. "The Dragon-Blooded themselves would not offend the honor of the temple or the city." But there's hints of doubt in his voice. "Nevertheless, I will take responsibility."

"Then it shall be as it shall be. Your word will be honored," says Gallius. To the troops, then, "Go on, there is still battle to be seen! Put a watch here and do as I have ordered. If things go amiss I will take it upon myself to right them in whatever way I can." She then turns to Davron, "Perhaps we should try and finish this mess?" she suggests.

Davron has watched the proceedings in grim silence - his mind is miles away, and he's constantly looking over his shoulder, wondering even now what may be happening to Willow - and how she came to be taken so far away from her home. At Gallius' words, he starts slightly from his gloomy reverie. "Finish what, Lady Gallius?" he says, blinking slightly.

"The battle," she answers softly. Gallius turns away from the temple, sighing. "It seems there must be some way to hasten this foolish waste of life. It is long been decided. Davron, carry me above, I wish to see what is happening. Let's find our allies."

---

The Healing tents are full of wounded, some with shallow but distracting injuries, others maimed or out of the battle, still others the overlabored workers are trying to ease out of this world with as little suffering as possible. The night is dark, for it is before the sun shall rise, and the mood beneath the canvas matches that gloom. Dozens of cots and blankets are laid out before the tent itself for more injured, a man too old to raise a sword, but still able to lend a healing hand tends to the fallen outside. He looks up. "You again? You need to rest." "Just two more," Says the Dawn, blood having caked over his torn shirt, bruises and cuts clotted shut. The wounds are much easier to see as he he lowers the soldier in his arms, then the other over his shoulder. "All right. You be careful," knowingly says the healer; Chi-Yosh has been saying that same line for the last ten trips.

It doesn't take much time for Gallius and Davron to locate Ramar, who is tending to the emotional needs of the wounded, and Chi-Yosh and Marina, who are using their knowledge (natural and magically acquired) of medicine to tend to their physical demands. The night has been hard on everyone, and it shows in the gaunt faces of everyone the Solars gaze at. Still, in some eyes there gleams a spark of hope, for the battle has been going well. A quicker victory than anyone could have predicted may return these men and women to their families weeks or months in advance, and this fierce hope keeps many alive who'd otherwise fade away in despair.

Davron has little room in his heart for hope now, though neither yet for despair. Instead, his mind is afflicted with foreboding, and no great measure of self-doubt. His conscience castigates him for abandoning Willow in her hour of need, while his wisdom insists that gathering his allies around him first will better ensure his cousin's safety. Bringing himself back to the present, he calls his friends together, briefly explaining what he saw. "Gallius's scouts are searching even now. When they find them..." Davron's voice wavers. "I know I cannot save my cousin alone, against so many. We all have our responsibilities here... but I beg you, my friends, to help me save her, and the others enslaved with her."

"It looks like the worst of it's over for now," explains Ramar, his voice kept soft as he speaks to those wounded unfortunate enough to be awake and in pain, "That you have survived this far is something to be thankful for. It should not be much longer now, the bloody mess will be over with and we will be victorious. Hope remains on this day for in the years to come, when stories of our fight and our deeds are told, you will be there to remember it. You will be there to teach those who have yet to be born, to see all that you fought for come to pass. Then, you shall know peace and rest. For now though, let us first make it through this night?" Ramarsmiles, sadly, then turns to look up as the Solars reunite. "What news from the front?" He pauses, listening to Davron. "Of course. We're your Circle. You need not beg."

Gallius will stand outside the conversation for a moment, her mind already wondering what news is to be had. She will catch the attention of a soldier and send her off to gather news before returning her attention to her friends. "I hope to find out what I can, but I think most of the defenses are over-run already. It is now just a matter of them giving up. There are two people I wish to find, however, and I think perhaps I ought to see to it swiftly. I wonder where the twins are."

"Gallius, you have the time at least to remain here and help Davron with his decision. To at least reassure him he has your aid." Ramar gestures towards Davron, then looks to the city, "I suspect they shall be in the Citadel. Or, they may be mounting a rescue attempt on Alcis. In any case, I shall help you find them as well. Thankfully those rumors of the dead army were just that."

Chi-Yosh stands solemn, his whole form a mess from the battle and the tending care afterwards. Despite the grim grime, the Bronze Tiger's eyes are sharp yet soft to his Circle Mate. "We will see that as the sun rises in a new day over Greyfalls, that the light will banish the slavers to the darkest holes and offer warmth and joy upon the faces of your fellows."

"The decision is clear," answers Gallius. "His friends must be rescued and we will aid him as we may, but the city cannot be forsaken. I believe we may have to divide our forces to achieve this task. I think perhaps those who go would do well to free all the slaves, if can be achieved."

Ramar asks Chi-Yosh, "And why should the sun not bring warmth and joy to the slavers, instead showing them the true beauty of Creation? It could reach in through the cracks in their hearts to illuminate their very souls..." He considers his words, "Perhaps this questions is better left answered later. I think that if we finish our work in the city, we shall be able to catch the slavers in no time. They are taking the long, silent way to wherever they are going. They will stop to rest, to eat, to keep their slaves from dying. We on the other hand, can move faster than any of them..."

Ramar says, "And have the advantage of following a bloody obvious trail. If I am to presume that there was a large host of them."

Davron glares at Ramar. "Helios can light their hearts from the inside of a jail cell, if they are lucky enough to survive," he snaps, uncharacteristically irritable. "Else, let Gaia teach them the error of their ways."

Ramar responds to Davron's glare with a somewhat troubled look. He speaks, and there is concern in his voice "It is not for us to decide their fates, merely to choose our own. They may be capable of learning from their mistakes. We shall see soon enough."

"If they let the slaves go they will learn. Who are these slavers you saw, Davron?" asks Gallius. As is her wont, she begins to pace, wishing to hear some news of the battle.

Chi-Yosh considers Ramar for a moment. He is good, and full of compassion, even for the darkest of men that would sell a brother for shiny rocks. There are lessons to be learned from him, and ones to teach. But for the moment - one of the first few moments - the solar sits down, rubbing his aching shoulder and ribs.

Davron shakes his head. "It was dark. All I could see was that they wore the garb of the Linowans. Why they got roped into the slave trade, I don't know - that isn't their usual sport."

Ramar says, "Then it is worth finding out. How many would you guess there are, so that I might make sure I follow the proper group...?"

"I'm sure we'll find the total story of their numbers from Gari and the scouts," says Gallius. She will sigh softly and lose herself in worry again, "Perhaps I have been here too long. I must find my men and see to them."

Ramar spreads his arms out, indicating the tent behind him, "Your men are in here Gallius, laying among the wounded... perhaps they might do well to hear from their faithful leader?"

"Those men are tended and safe as can be," answers Gallius. "My strength would be best used to make sure they are not joined by too many of their kin. I am no great healer, though Jin-nu has talents to combat the damages of war. I think perhaps I had best find her and get the people of Roleyn and the Apemen back into order. There is no telling what remains after this night."
