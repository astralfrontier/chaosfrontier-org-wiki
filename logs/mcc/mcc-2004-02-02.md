# Millennium City Chronicles 2004-02-02

The door is closed to Guy's office, and at present the detective is hard at work on some mind-bogglingly puzzling case. His feet are propped up on his desk, his arms are folded neatly over her stomach, and his hat is pulled down over his face. Every now and again it rises and falls with the rythmic breathing of the detective. With a start he sits up, almost falling out of his chair, "I'm awake... I'm awake..." he mutters, and quickly begins hitting keys on his keyboard, snapping the machine out of snooze mode as well. _Now uh... where was I?_

The detective has a case. A simple case of doing a background check on a Mr Greene, requested by his neighbor who, after the first five minutes, Guy was certain his client was a paranoid neurotic right out of Hitchcock. And while he has things to do regarding Snake, Mr. Greene's papertrail and history is an afternoon's worth of activity that he can get done quick, before going out on the trail with the other team members. Then the phone rings.

It takes Guy one or two tries to grab the phone. Still sleepy, it seems. "Hello?" _What kind of guy could possibly need THAT many.._ "Guy Neville, Private Eye..." _And uhm, geee. Wow. And I thought DG was nuts..._ "If you need something done, I'm your Guy. How can I help you?"

"Havn't changed a bit, have you, Neville?" Harvy Dock, the chrisp yet almost oilly voice stirring up old memories, and none of them overly pleasant. "And what are you doing today, gumshoe?"

"Nothing worth your skill and excellence, Dock. Why don'cha go find some old lady's poodle instead of bothering me?" Guy's face sinks into an annoyed expression. _Still, at least it's not the prof._

"Wellll, it just so happens your name crossed my desk. And my camera lense. Tell me, what does Millenium City Mall, the Downtown MCPD, and a Starrbucks have in common?"

"They're all overpriced for the goods they sell?" Guy grins, "Either that or you want one that's a little inappropriate for your ears. I've heard that one a dozen times Dock."

Harvy just chuckles, in a 'We both know the answer, and I've got you' way. "Not quite. Y'see, all three of these places have eye witness accounts, security tapes, and testimonials from criminals that there was a man, in a trenchcoat, who disappeared and reappeared all about, and had incredible speed. And, here I am, looking at a picture that looks Remarkly... like you."

"Well, I do have devilishly handsome good looks, but Dock, if you think you're seeing me in every picture now, you're just going to have to stop all that wishful thinking." A smirk, which thankfully doesn't transmit over the phone as Guy types in a few keys, continuing the paper trail digging, lazily. "What's it to you anyway?"

Harvy continues, content as a proverbial cat with the mouse under it's paw. "It's not so much to me... as it is to a reporter for the Chronicle. One that marches to the tune of Arlene Raymond. She seems pretty adamant about those people with the exceptional quirks and their true identities and whatnot. And, well, one of these pictures happens to place you in close proximity to a certain skull headed celebrity. Think she'd be interested?"

"I hate to tell you this, but she was quite interested. We met already. We exchanged a few words here and there, and she ended up grateful after I saved her life from mobsters. So, is their anything else you'd care to mention to me? Or are you done telling me things I already know. Some of us still have to pay rent you know." Guy just shakes his head a few times.

"Oooh, sorry tiger. I-" Guy keeps the radio that connects him to the rest of the group on hand, which begins to squak. "Attention." The voice is very foreign - as foreign as China.

Guy taps the radio on his ear, splitting his attention between the two voices. It's not too hard, just a matter of slowing time enough to pay attention to one and then the other. "So what did you want Dock? I've got another case to take, but I'm hap-I'll look for-uhm, I'll talk to ya later."

Guy drums his fingers on the desk, getting a bit impatient. _What is it now? I don't remember placing an order on the radio..._

"Whatever you say, Neville. Look for your name in big bold letters." Click. "Attention," Says the voice into the radio again. "We have your negro. We will have our honor back." The sound of machinegun fire the last thing that comes through the radio - literally - as static enters the earpiece.

Guy shouts into the radio, "Listen you freaks, you're going down. 'Specially if you hurt a hair on his head. And... uh... vengeance for last night's lo mein, which is still ravaging my innards." He's already teleporting to the warehouse, looking for Shawntae. _Just on the off chance they're lying._ "Guys... you might wanna come and help out."

The cruiser with Professor Ming inside is headed towards the Downtown area, it's destination to a facility twelve blocks from the MC FBI headquarters. Ming sits in the back, cuffed and buckled in - courtesy of an officer. The two uniforms are almost eerily silent, except for the police radio squaking this and that.

The gap between the car and the one before it lasts for only seconds. Then a black shape darts out of the very surface of the road itself, leaping and landing roughly on the hood of the vehicle. The black overcoat of the Ghost Knight billows and snaps wildly in the wind as he crouches low, glaring in through the windshield. **Pull Over.**

The uniform behind the wheel swerves as he gets the crap startled out of him, sending the cruiser left and right, while the passenger fumbles with his gun. After nearly ramming into the car in front of him, "Get off the hood!"

(( Relax )) Ming fires off to Ghost Knight. And then, the car is suddenly starting to burn, flames rising about the form of the vehicle. To add to the effect, Ming shrieks at the top of her lungs.

"Holy shit!" Screams the passanger as the driver swerves to the side. Tires scream all around as the cruiser rides the sidewalk curb, taking a parking meter in the side and sending real sparks across the car. The driver throws open his car door, only to have it taken off by a passing car, before he leaps out. Cars behind the cruiser squeal to a halt, and a hand full of finder-benders take place. Meanwhile the cop riding shotgun does his best to get out of the car - through the window, as his door is jammed in the parking meter.

"The woman!" calls the driver. "Get her out!" As if on one mind, the two officers immediately scramble for the back doors.

**Wrong. Get in.** The Ghost drops down to street level, bodily checking the right-side cop and pushing him toward the door. **I'll explain on the way.**

(( What are we doing now, Thomas? I was almost free! )) She frowns, letting the flames fade away. Hopefully they will think it was Ghost Knight the whole time. Else she's in a world of trouble she'll never escape from.

Thomas replies, (( You will be soon. ))

The driver has his gun out, and at the moment staring down the Ghost Knight. "Okay, pal. Everyone knows you're Mr. Spooky shit, but you better give me a reason why I should listen to you that isn't a threat." The guy's partner, now up against the window, looks from the Ghost Knight to his partner, seeming to gain confidence like a returning tide.

Ming just curls up in a ball in the back seat of the vehicle, looking as helpless and wounded as possible. (( Did I mention that I used to kinda admire police officers? )) she murmurs along the link.

**Because you could use a righteous bust, and taking a schoolteacher downtown for receiving mail is not it,** replies the Ghost curtly, crawling into the back seat through the solid body of the car. **Now get in, and drive.**

For a few moments, the cops share a glance, then the passanger begins crawling back through the window. "Okay. Fine. Sam, call for an officer to see to the-" "I'm ahead of you," He replies, picking up the radio. The driver runs out, fetching the torn door, pops the trunk, and throws it in before leaping into the driver's seat and buckling up. Without a word, he goes.

DarkGlow opens his eyes and blinks through the darkness to the table where his team radio rests. _Knew I shoulda just turned it off..._ But of course he had good reason to leave it on--better to know they're calling and therefore have the choice as to answer or not than to simply not know. _Ignorance is bliss. Why can I never remember that?_ Still, he suddenly finds himself in the grip of a dilemma--stay here as he'd planned on doing until he was good and ready to do whatever he'd decided on doing and ignore all calls for chitchat or the heart-to-hearts (mind-to-mind, his brain chatters automaticaly), or actually go help someone out.

_I don't want to,_ DarkGlow tells himself firmly, except that it isn't quite true. After all, did he really want all that earlier effort in saving Shawntae going to waste now? And he would be really handy in tracking down the bastards who'd put the bomb in his spine--well, assuming that tidbit ever actually slipped out, perish the thought.

_Don't you? At all? No one's asked. You can always claim you did turn the radio off. No strings, no voices in your head telling you what to do. Just a kid who needs a bit o' help._

His eyes narrow and his hand chops at air with a savage fury. _No, damn it! I don't want to. I just want to sit here and not move until **something bloody well makes sense**!_ He stands in a smooth motion, and reaches for the cloak draped across his bed. _But I'll go anyway. Might be fun. Who knows?_

---

Pushing through the wall, GK comes upon what is left of Shawntae's work station. The computers are destroyed, gaping wounds staring back at the vigilante. It is simply a good thing the radio receiver wasn't in the warehouse itself, else it would have been trashed alongside the rest. A note is pinned with a knife on the wall, but something more urgent has the Knight's attention; a hole blasted in the wall where the door once was, Guy against the opposite wall. An aura of the living remains around him, still.

Thomas walks quickly toward Guy, and with an almost casual flick of his hands, the note tears itself from the knife and obediently zips into his grasp. He gives the detective a cursory inspection, then tries to rouse him to consciousness.

"Ugh," moans Guy, as he opens his eyes. "Oh great I'm in he-wait no... you're just GK. Oh hey! I'm alive! Didja get the number of that truck?"

**What happened here?** asks GK, calmly, listening as he glances down at the note.

"Well, there was a bomb that went off. I think Shawntae didn't tip the delivery guy enough..." Guy is clutching his head with his hands. "Gah. I feel like I've stayed out all night drinking. Without all the fun of drinking cheap liquor."

Written upon the piece of paper is a simple message in Mandarin. "The Ghost's grave is disturbed. Come consecrate yourself at midnight." An address is given, the construction site of an office building.

DarkGlow steps from the shadows. "I take it they weren't lying," he states flatly.

Thomas shrugs and tosses the note away. **It seems I have an appointment,** he says flatly. **Come on, you two.. We have to talk to somebody.**

DarkGlow's mouth tightens invisibly at the order, but he gives a careless shrug anyway. "I think you mean 'we', but for now, lead on."

"Wait wait wait," says Guy, looking rather confused at the exchange, "Which 'we' do you mean GK and DG? Because I don't see a difference here... but uhm, yeah let's go."

Outside, GK leads the way to the parked cop car. He presses a finger against the window, causing the glass to roll down of its own accord. **At about thirty minutes after midnight,** he says conversationally, to the two officers still inside, **you will find members of the Chinese Mafia unconscious, with illegal weapons.** He gives the address.

_Unconscious?_, DarkGlow thinks, _...yeah, I suppose that's best. Prol'ly easier, too._

Ming is just loitering in the car, beside herself with worry for her little sister. It's a wonder she hasn't done anything desperate yet. If she doesn't get home by morning she'll lose her patience and almost certainly do something horribly ill-advised.

The passanger officer jots down the address, while the driver looks back at the Ghost Knight skeptically. He thumbs back to Ming in the back seat. "Do you have a problem with us running her in, now?"

**I know this woman by reputation,** replies the Ghost, casually. **I want you to understand something.** He taps lightly on the roof of the car; the entire vehicle lifts itself effortlessly off the ground, as though glued to his hand. Very lightly he sets it down again. **Her safety and comfort is important to me. Do you understand?**

"What about my sister!" demands Ming. "Who is going to take care of her?" (( I can't leave her alone! I promised I'd take care of her! ))

(( It will be taken care of, )) replies GK, mentally. (( I will see to it. You have a secret to keep, so help me help you keep it. ))

(( My sister means more to me than any stupid secret )) replies Ming.

As if on the same string, both officers' heads bob up and down quickly. "We'll make sure to give the message to the Feds. Then the driver turns around. "Calm down, ma'am. If everything checks out, you won't be there too long. Even if you're clean as Mary, it would take an hour or two of processing, and if they're quick you're out." He looks helpless, as if wanting to say 'but if you're not...'.

(( And her well-being and comfort depend on your secret being kept, )) replies the Ghost Knight, a bit harshly. More privately, and to Ming alone, he continues. (( You think Chris Green's life would be worth anything if people knew who she was to me? ))

Ming just falls quiet, utterly defeated. (( These powers aren't very useful when it's important. ))

(( They are important now. Stay connected with us. We'll see to everything. Trust me. )) GK backs away from the car, making no further attempt to impede its progress.

As if on cue, the cruiser starts up, and it pulls out of the parking space and out onto the road, taking Ming with it.

Thomas turns to the others, thinking and speaking simultaneously so that Ming, DarkGlow and Guy can all receive. **I humiliated the Tong some time back. It seems they tracked Shawntae down and kidnapped him. This is my responsibility. If you wish to assist me, it will be welcome. It seems we have some time to prepare.**

"Alright, then let's prepare. I mean, honestly, you can't really expect us to just say 'no we're not gonna help you beat up a metric buttload of mooks.' Sign me up." Guy paces, a little frustrated, "So how do you propose we prepare, fearless leader?"

DarkGlow shrugs. "Funny thing about studying your navel is that it's always there if you have to take a break and come back to it later. Assuming you don't buy the farm in the meantime, of course."

The black figure nods his fleshless head. **Right. First, the Tongs know about this place now. It would be pointless to continue operating here. Gather up anything either of you have left here. Second, DarkGlow and I should go to the site to examine it. Guy, you look like you could use some time to recover. Once you feel rested, I want to know who owns the building at this address, and who owns them.**

"Sure thing GK. I'll be at my office if you need me. Oww. Consider the information yours by the end of the day." And at that, Guy is back in his office, nursing his wounds.

"There's nothing for me here," DarkGlow tells GhostKnight, the words perhaps a touch ominous to anyone looking to read deeper meanings into things. "Let's get going."

The building is a little more then girders for now. The first layers of walls - panels of wood as little more then a brace and an idea - make up the twelve story skeleton of a building. At the moment, the site is roped off, yet alive with activity, construction workers operating heavy machinery, and oddly enough, something that looks like a crude skeletal 'spider', clinging to the side of the building and riveting around the outside of the beams. The Ghost Knight observes from below while above, an invisible source moves around.

Ming sits in an interrogation room, across from the two agents who arrested her earlier that morning. Fish has a file a mile wide, with a dozen pictures situated in front of Ming. They are mostly of the picturesque Aryan man, blonde, tall, Caucasian. Teleios. 'The Perfect Man'. The other pictures are of monsters, both in the field and on the disection table.

Ming just kinda looks at the pictures, and she sends the images along the link. (( If they tell me that they're taking me to Area 51 I'm going to get testy. I wish these idiots would just get to the point. They should stick to handing out parking tickets and accosting old ladies that j-walk, leave the real cases to adults. ))

"... and we believe that he has had contact with you recently," finishes Fish, watching Ming carefully. "One geneticist in Germany has disappeared three months ago; you may know him, a James Weber."

(( So you think I should tell these guys the whole truth, or just blow smoke in their faces for a while? )) asks Ming. (( They probably know about the little package, at this point. If they've screwed around in my house I swear I'm going to sue. ))

(( Answer questions, but don't volunteer anything, )) advises GK. (( I'll be at your house shortly, anyway. ))

"Doctor Weber had been doing some interesting research, though I don't really see a reason for his disappearance," says Ming. "And I think someone may be trying to contact me, though I don't know why. Though if James Weber was taken, I might have a guess. As you likely know, my research parallels his. Do you now suspect that I am going to be kidnapped or killed as Doctor Weber was? If so, you had better have taken precautions to make sure my little sister is safe." She hopes these guys aren't just wasting her time..

"Your sister is currently under watch in her school. She has not been approached by our agents but we have people watching her to make sure that she is not apprehended or attacked in school. As soon as that gets out, she'll be tailed back to your home - or to a friend's house, or where ever it is that she goes after school," Points out the female agent who reclines against the wall behind Fish, who nods. "Someone may be trying to contact you?"

"Yes," says Ming. "I was sent something, a package with a strange sample. I had thought it was merely some prank, but.. perhaps not. Do you know anything else about Doctor Weber's disappearance? Was anything stolen from his lab?"

"We're not sure, exactly, yet," replies Dadeson. "You have no idea how hard it is to pass information between international and national agencies, but we have someone working on it. Please, what was in the package?"

"A video and a sample," says Ming. "And I have a great knowledge of how difficult that is, even if it's just intellectual in content. I don't think it is dangerous. I was analyzing the sample. It involved some sort of complex gene-splicing. I was curious about the reality of it."

Fish nods. "Okay. Where is the sample? We'd like to take a look at it. If nothing else, there might be evidence somewhere in the package of Teleios's whereabouts." The agent doesn't sound too sure, but he can hope.

"There wasn't much on it," says Ming. "I was going to throw it away, but I figured I better open it. The sample is now sitting at the university, in my office. I locked it in a drawer. There's a copy of the rest there, as well. The package is in a trashcan in my office, as well. There wasn't anything special about it, but maybe you can find something."

Fish nods, and gives a look at Dadeson.

It takes three hours later before Ming is released. Some how, oddly enough, they found the things in Ming's office - she suspects they combed it many times and only to have it "appear". Thomas reported that her house looked jostled; not torn apart, but people had been there, sifting through her trash and carefully looking in nooks and crannies. Ming is apologized to. "Oh, and one more thing," adds Dadeson, "The masked man who interrupted your transfer? He's being looked for too."

"You can look, but from my experience, men like that are best left alone." Ming walks away from the mess, quickly hailing a taxi and rushing home. She wants to get away from these people. She wants to get away from everything for a while.

Guy, after having recooperated, made his time digging into the building's existance. It belongs to Tanner, Danken and Hodge, a law firm moving into the new building. After digging, pushing, checking legal materials, mergers and three hours of hard work, Guy works back to the owners of Tanner, Danken and Hodge: Greymalkin Corp.

And at the construction site, while still occupied by workers, is also home to efforts of an entirely different flavor. The possibility that anyone visiting the site at midnight will be wearing night-vision gear has been raised. GK has spent his time assembling flash-bombs with his powers, as miniaturized as his abilities can make them, with adhesive backing. DarkGlow, unseen by all, has been installing them throughout the structure, at critical points. He is also the one to carry the multi-function transmitter that can set them off as needed, to avoid flashing himself at an inopportune moment. Whatever else happens tonight, whoever comes to pay their respects to the team will not have an easy time.
