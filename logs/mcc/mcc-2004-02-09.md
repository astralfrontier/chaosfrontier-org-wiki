Released from the mess of police, Ming makes for home. She is far from happy with them, but right now annoyance is put away for other matters. At home, she works quickly to clean up the mess that the police left behind. She's careful enough to record the mess first, of course. If they don't apologize, she'll definitely make quite the scene!

Ming's work doesn't end for a few hours, when her sister comes home. Home at an innopportune moment, because friends are brought in the house and Ming is standing by the 'fridge, pulling out a beer and wearing nothing but her underwear. Worse yet, there steps are bringing them closer. Above all, Ming wishes she could just disappear right about now.

Having no good idea of what to do, Ming just stays still, focusing on things a bit differently than she ever had before. The kids walk by, survey the kitchen, and while they are distracted in this way, Ming sneaks out, making for her room quickly. In the back of her mind, she wonders if she can turn this off..

After getting some clothes back on, Ming sends out a message along the mind link. (( Well, they didn't ransack the place, but I won't feel quite clean until I throw all my unmentionables away and buy new ones.. ))

(( Just don't report to us like this when you go shopping as well, please )) responds Thomas, sullenly.

Taking that as a sign to tease Thomas, Ming will send along the image she sees in the mirror as she slips her clothes on. (( You are no fun at all, Ghost Knight. ))

All teasing aside, Ming will act more seriously once she gets the call from Ghost Knight. Beat people up. Check! She makes sure to tell her sister that she'll be going out for the night. Naturally Ming gets teased in turn. She should really just say Thomas is her boyfriend. It'd be so much simpler for her. She gets her gear on and sneaks out, using her newfound talent at avoiding notice.

DarkGlow stands apart from GhostKnight, silently waiting for the appointed time and doing the occasional stretch. _When walking on girders, limber is good. 'S been a while--wonder if I can still do a backflip?_ GhostKnight's flash-bomb control is safely in a belt pouch; he feels it hanging at his side. Irritation pricks the calmness he'd been working to gather. _Probably just blind myself if I tried using them. Just dropping the control would probably be a bit obvious--maybe I can arrange to 'fall' on it? Why did I agree to plant the damn things, anyway?_ A sidelong glance at the GhostKnight. _Oh, right, because I'm trying to be helpful. Nice and cheery and sweet and why do my teeth ache all of a sudden? Geh, maybe the bloody things'll come in handy._ He stares upwards at the half-finished building. _Can still bug out, you know._ He shrugs to himself. _Eh, maybe later._

After insistently pressing DarkGlow into duty hiding the bombs, GhostKnight has been relatively quiet, not mentioning the little incident in the warehouse. DarkGlow, while grateful, isn't entirely certain this is a good thing. On the one hand, it's stopped DarkGlow from being able to storm away in anger at some real or imagined slight, on the other hand he has no idea what's going on inside that bony skull. He shies away from that idea, as he does from the memory of shadows of thought and piercing pain and eyes dimmed by blood. It goes easily, to his relief. _If I had a finer sense of paranoia, I think I might be worried. Fortunately, I know I'm not that important. Deadly, yes. Important, not so much._ He draws a deep breath into his lungs. _I like the quiet, but I think I like when the quiet ends even more. Not much longer now. Not long at all._

The construction sight, to the Ghost Knight's perception, is alive. Clusters of auras cling everywhere: within the building itself, around it behind machinery, materials, debris, and as he observes the surrounding area, in adjacent buildings on the roof, or within them are a few remnant auras. Some buildings have a number of people in them, with a few sparse lights on. A more indeph sweep of the construction site proves interesting; in one or two places, away from it all, are cameras, or some other device. Where auras are not impeding his perception, it appears his flashbombs are still in place. Within the center of the building itself, suspended in the center of the structure is, for what the Knight can tell, a person.

**I need you to do recon,** explains GK, after his silent survey is done. **You can see and not be seen. I cannot see who is at the center of the building, nor if he is rigged up with explosives.**

DarkGlow comes easily out of his reverie. "Sure."

A trunk is suspended in the air between the girding framework. The trunk is heavy, almost five feet long. Attached to each side of the trunk is a cord affixed to one of the four girders at the topmost level. Above each of the affixed cables is a camouflaged screen, behind which hides a crouched man in a dark suit and a yellow cap. On the ground are more obvious men, crouched with various, nasty weaponry behind various obsticles.

_I once thought it might be fun to be able to bring someone through the shadows with me. Pity I never actually tried it out._ DarkGlow regards the setup, memorizing the details. A moment later GhostKnight is brought up to date.

"Wouldn't it be clever if he actually wasn't the guy in the trunk? If it was only a decoy?" DarkGlow concludes.

Thomas nods slowly. **A distinct possibility. I will go find out.** And with that he sinks through the floor, and disappears.

---

Since the day on Peche Island, where the Tongs a good score were single-handedly vanquished, their head has been bowed in shame, their honor smudged. Several of their ranks had been killed because they were sloppy and disgraceful. Since that day, they have vowed to return the favor. The thought of revenge and retribution sings through the head of every prepared Tong, cradling their weapons close. Today they have prepared for the Ghost.

Firing the information gained from Shawntae along the link, Clarity adds her own thoughts. (( I imagine that trunk is full of explosives. We can't be sure, though. I imagine they aren't ready for all us just yet. I imagine I can create a bit of a distraction, if I can get near them. )) And then she considers the skill she first used tonight. (( I may be able to get close to them. ))

From out of the shadows and the angles of the construction site, boots clank against floor in step after step. The heavy black armor and the grinning, pale skull advance casually, then stop perhaps a dozen or more paces away. **I have come.**

(( Don't try yet, )) transmits GK. (( The trunk has something alive within it, that much I'm confident of. I want to force their hand first. ))

One Tong stands up from behind a piece of sheetrock, clutched in his hands a shotgun. "And you, Armored Ghost, we are here." The night, however, is still. The first time, the men had rushed, and they had been taken under by a trap. Now, even as they lurk behind every obsticle, have prepared the snare, they are wary. They will not be fooled twice.

**Release your captive,** the Ghost commands, harshly. The black figure stands unmoving, uncaring, unconcerned by the numbers around him.

DarkGlow watches Guy and Clarity shoot flickering glances at one another, and surmises what's going on. _Yeah, I like the quiet._ He shrugs and resumes his watch on the building. He figures a nice, loud bang will shortly be telling him when to move. Who needs telepathic signals, anyway?

(( Just let me know when it's time for the butt-kicking. I'm all set. )) Informs Guy, helpfully.

Who indeed. Ming isn't about to start chatting where she knows people will soon be trying to shoot her. (( Something alive.. hrm. )) She sighs mentally, but stays ready. She is already preparing herself for whatever she may have to do.

The Tong waves his gun towards the box. "You will come and get him. You are the Mighty Ghost. Even if we are not challenge enough, you will have to climb." The tension in the air is as dense as water; one action could easily break it and send the site into chaos.

Obligingly the dark figure steps forward. A black glove reaches out for the clasps of the trunk.

DarkGlow frowns as he considers the numbers arrayed against them. _Well, I can't just wrap 'em all up in shadow, but maybe if I spread the shadows around thinly, I can use that blinding trick. Be a real shame if someone accidentally stepped where there was no floor..._ He glances at Guy and Clarity; still not a word from them. _Fine. Whatever. We could probably use a flanking attack, anyway._ A moment later he's on the opposite side of the building, invisibly watching for a likely clump of targets to blind, and waiting for his bump in the night.

The clasps unhook. Several things happen at once. The mechanical "hum" of machinery primed for action behind the Knight - the "spider" which he had seen working on the building. The trunk's top coming open, and while no fire works, no one leaps out immediately either. And the speaker screams out, "You must defeat us to find him!" The first shot is fired, and then half a dozen, then more then twenty guns begin to scream into the night.

The spectral figure shivers, as it is riddled with round after round of automatic, armor-piercing weapons fire. The Tongs took no chances. Bullets by the dozens tear into the body armor of the Ghost as it flails helplessly. Scant seconds later the body collapses to the floor, lifeless and motionless.

(( I guess it's time to see just what is going on in this mess. )) Ming will make her way closer, calling upon her abilities to avoid notice. She creeps her way closer, not quite sure just what she'll be doing, but eager to try to help. (( Ghost Knight, you have anything you want me to do specifically? Or should I just knock these guys out one at a time? ))

(( Get who you can. Break them up. Take them on singly if possible. )) GK's mental voice is strong and confident, despite the brutal violence inflicted on his armor.

Three Tongs hunker behind some piping and wood, one clutching a heavy machinegune propped on the boards, crouched beside him are two others. The shadows around them leap up, swallowing their faces, snaking around goggles or unprotected faces, even their neighbor, a man hunkering behind a barrel, take the hit, yelling into the night.

_Well, now. I think that might probe useful in the future. _DarkGlow thinks, watching the confusion and nodding to himself. _And they aren't even hurt. That's gotta be a plus in someone's book, right?___

__Guy leans out from behind the girder he'd been poised behind. With a flick of the wrist, his signature Walther PPK is in his hand, and the flash of the muzzle is breaking the night air. "Yo, losers, over here!" He watches the bullet fly past, barely winging one of the guys. _Geez. What a wussy shot.___

__As the Tongs creep closer to the downed black shape, a snapping and crashing sound suddenly makes itself known overhead, as every light within a dozen yards is blown out simultaneously. The central area is plunged into darkness.__

__The detective is little more than a blur. At least to the others. The Tongs certainly have shot at him, lots and lots of bullets it would seem. To Guy, they're moving by at a snail's pace, the rippling trails of the disturbed air and light lingering as they rush past his twisting and dodging body. When the last flash of a Tong's muzzle has gone past, Guy stands untouched. "Not good enough. C'mon. Let's see what else you've got." And with that Guy runs down one of the hallways, trenchcoat fluttering, beckoning the tongs after him.__

__DarkGlow eyes the snipers above him. _Too spread out, I think. Well, then..._ Stripping shadows from his concealment, he shapes a thin shaft, and flings it toward the closest sniper. The shadow spear hits, and the sniper falls from the girder. DarkGlow is disappointed to see him jerked out of the fall by a safety rope of some sort. _Pity. Guess they're not stupid, though.___

__Ming reaches out with her mind, convincing a large cluster of the Tong that their guns are badly jammed. As a unit they start to mess around with their weapons, pulling out clips and inspecting their imaginarily useless firearms. For the moment, the mind link goes quiet.__

__Several Tongs leap from their hiding places - finally, a visible target. A half dozen charge after Guy, releasing a pepper of gunfire after the Trenchcoated P.I, while others choke the gun close. The men around the Ghost Knight pause. The earth shakes above it as the "spider", a new construction device. It ambles over the area the Ghost Knight was, stomping the steel "Legs" around, before one crunches into the armor itself. The five Tongs move closer, with a wary pace.__

__Somewhere on the second floor of the complex, someone screams in Chinese. A spark then erupts in one Tong's hands, lighting up his body to show that among the black clothing, there is a mechanical rigging, like a vest with a lense, other things attached to the body itself. He hurls the sparking light into the darkness, that soon erupts into a nimbus of light, showing the Knight's armor crunched beneath an arm of the spider. Men move closer.__

__DarkGlow's attention alights on another sniper, and a second shadow spear finds it's mark. This time, however, the sniper doesn't fall--he doesn't even grunt. _Stoic bastard,_ he thinks with a touch of respect. _But can you take a another?___

__Grabbing hold of some of the steel cables, Guy spins about on his attackes, stepping out of the way of several more bullets. He's just too fast for them, sending wind rushing down the hallway ahead of him as he runs around them, snaring two of them, tightly. "That oughta hold you." He looks at the other two, holds his arms up in a martial stance, "Bring it."__

__Nothing much happens around the armor. Then a hand sticks straight up through the floor, into the belly of the arachnoform robot. There's a sizzling sound, sparks, and the sound of gears and hydraulics whining. A moment passes. The device falls, quinsected, and five pieces strike the ground around the fallen Ghost.__

__Clarity, pleased with her handiwork for now, will wrap herself up and restore the link once more. (( Anyone figure out where our captive is yet? )) she asks. She'll work her way further in, looking for some way to get up near that dangling box.__

__Above Ming, on the fourth level, muted Chinese in hushed tones rise among the three remaining snipers. Apparently their attention has been diverted towards the spot the strike had come. They shift their rifles, leveling it on the ball of darkness.__

__DarkGlow notes the guy throwing the sparks, and wonders if he would prove a more dangerous target than the snipers. Uncaring of the guns swinging to bear on him, he flies through shadow and buries a shadow blade in the fellow. He falls from the girder with an almost disappointing ease. His eyes see something like a flare gun tumbling. _Ah, fooled me.___

__"Alright. Fine. Then I suppose we'll just do this the hard way. Well... it's hard for you." Guy sort of dissolves. He's no longer standing where he'd been standing, and instead seems to be in four places at once. The breeze picks up with the between ticks of the clock movements of the detective. Fists fly, hitting here and there, spinning into a kick as the detective flips from one guy, and finishes his move, finally slowing down enough to be in one place. Again. He flexes his fists, shakes his head, winks, "Now that's what I meant when I said, the hard way."__

__Five weapons point every which way. Five pairs of suspicious eyes scan the flare-lit darkness of the construction sight. The ruined shell of the Ghost Knight lays on the ground, without life. And without warning, it rises, springing to life - for its wearer has phased upward through the floor, merging with it seamlessly as he propels himself into the air. Heavy boots lash out, striking rapidly and surely. The Ghost lands in a crouch, his longcoat spinning, his head tracking rapidly to seek out more movement. And around him, five bodies collapse unconscious, just as five parts of the spider did seconds ago.__

__Ming frowns in thought. (( Well, it seems like he might not even be here. I have a feeling Shawntae is a way off. You hear anything Shawntae? )) She turns to consider the guys fiddling with their weapons and shakes her head. (( I may have to harm them, if this continues.. ))__

__At the sight of the Ghost Knight's display, six Tongs, weapons ready, simply drop the weapons and run. Two others leap out of construction machinery that they had just brought to life, and flee into the night. Three men have discovered their weapons are fine, one turning around and looking up as a Tong falls to the ground beside him. Looking up, he spots a shadowy figure on the girder. He screams in Cantonise, of a demon.__

__Ming reaches out with her mind, trying to make a more effective use of her skills, something that will cause the men to give up their fighting. The illusion is flawed, however, and the guns unaffected. She curses in her mind, angry at the waste of effort and time.__

__Above the construction site, a helicopter flies over, a spotlight sweeping over the area for a few moments, a few minor flashes issuing forth from below. As it passes over, the spotlight falls onto the trunk, where stands a black figure. In his hand is a sword. "Armored Ghost!" He hurls from above an object which shatters at the Knight's feet. It is a pair of glasses. Shawntae's glasses. The sword drops down, slicing three of the four cords holding the trunk up. It drops, swinging down, before he leaps from it and onto the girder, pushing off a wall to slide down a diagnial girder. The sound of a motor roaring issues, before a motorcycle bursts across the ground.__

__The motorcycle burns across the loose dirt, kicking a tail behind it. It comes to a partial jump, up across an impromptu ramp. As the cycle goes airborne, the darkness around the racing ricebox snaps like a beartrap, striking the rider in the chest and ripping him off the seat to hover momentarily in the air, the bike going several feet before simply coming to a stop, but still running, as if waiting patiently for the rider.__

__DarkGlow blinks at the effort, but grins savagely in triumph. _Don't leave so soon. I insist...___

__The Ghost leaps for the girder supporting the Tong's snipers. He vaults unsupported, slamming two gloved palms into the bottom of the steel supports, and using his power to send a vibration of great power through them.__

__DarkGlow senses that the shadows from his initial blinding attack are dissipating. Trying to keep his prisoner firm with one corner of his mind, he strengthens the blinding shadows.__

__A ripple courses through the structure, sending the snipers falling backwards and shouting. One falls and slams into the back of the trunk, and he squeals in fear, but nothing happens. Then the trunk explodes, sending a fireball that nearly reaches the other snipers and sets off several flashbombs, flooding the night with a brilliant arch of light. Below, the rider bursts from the shadows to fall on the ground, then two steps finds the bike, and is moving again.__

__As Guy leaps at the remaining Tongs, his foot snaps out. For a brief moment he splits, appearing on the ground, and in mid air, and then beside each tong in turn, the meaty thwack of foot to face resounding out of synch with the detective's movements. When he slows, the others have yet to hit the ground, and Guy watches the guy on the bike. "Hmm. Someone better stop him." (( Clarity? You wanna take this guy down? ))__

__The rider is nearly out of the construction site before the ground is open in a long ditch under him. There isn't a way he could make it over without crashing, as shadow conceals the ground. Instead, he leaps off the bike, letting it sail over the hole. He hits the ground in a crouch, and makes for a run while the bike comes to a complete stop beside him, now ignored.__

__With the snipers out of the way, the Ghost plummets into the open air for a moment, then darts through the air, zipping around the perimeter of the half-formed building. He streaks toward the half-immobilized biker, skidding to a stop within ten feet of him as he touches down. **You have someone we want.**__

__"Oh no ya don't!" shouts Guy as he watches the one fellow run off away from the construction site. His hand stretches outwards, and the detective grunts, struggling to bring his powers under control. The fleeing tong's footfalls soften and slow to a mere crawl. "Hang on just a minute pal, we need to have a few words with you."__

__The rider turns, sword in hand. "And you are something we want." Beind him, the Knight can see two auras speeding towards him, they are almost deathly silent, dark, but as they get closer, he can spot them. Motorcycles. They fan out behind the swordsman, then close in tight, flashing on either side of the Ghost Knight, swords flashing in the night's sky.__

__The riders came prepared. Despite his armor, the Ghost Knight keels over, slumping heavily to the ground. And this time, it's not an act for gun-toting criminals__

__The bikes come to a stop behind the Knight, bright with blood. The pair are poised on their motorcycles, watching the Ghost Knight slump to the ground. The steedless rider raises his sword, pointing down at the Ghost. "The Tongs have requested their honor to be won, for they have failed. We have come. We will put you to rest, spirit."__

__A blinded and cursing DarkGlow feels the shadows surround him, and uses them to escape the building. Alone and safe, with calm deliberation, he removes the flash-bomb control from his pouch and uses the thin edge of a shadow to slice it into sections. Unsurprisingly, he's rather unconcerned abou this fingers. _He didn't mean for that to happen. It was an accident. We'll probably share a laugh about it later._ Bits fall to the ground; he wills his rage to fall with them.__
