# Millennium City Chronicles 2004-02-16

Reaching out through the aether of the psychic world, Clarity creates a shadow in the minds of those near Ghost Knight's body. Pressing her will into their mind's eye, she sends the form of Ghost Knight into the ground, blurry the perceptions of her opponents so they match her illusion.

The sword-wielders pause momentarily, regarding the ground. "The Armored Ghost has fled." "He is dishonorable," Declares one rider, "Not worth our challenge." "No. But we will see to his cowardness another time." They turn towards the others. "Interfere with our leaving, and the captive dies."

One of the bikers removes a flare gun from a pocket, and fires it into the air. They then mount their bikes, and drive off in different directions. The sound of shattered glass comes from one of them, with smoke curling up into the air. Moments later, Ming gets contact from Shawntae. Someone is telling him where he is.

Guy hesitates. If he chases after the swordsmen, then Shawntae could be in trouble. On the other hand, that smoke... He's a blur of motion towards the thing itself, and returns momentarily with a letter. "Hey. Anyone speak... pictures?" He shows the note, which Ming recognizes from a few superhero manga: Japanese.

Clarity frowns in thought. She'll look around for Dark Glow for a moment. "Hey, I'm getting something of use. Can't you open your mind for once, Dark Glow? Isn't it about time we stop acting silly?" She turns her attention then to Ghost Knight, checking him over, a worried expression on her face.

(( Give me a minute. )) Thomas sends back to Ming, as the Knight himself sinks into the earth once more. (( I need to get myself back together. Something was punctured. ))

DarkGlow slowly begins to perceive things once again through his eyes. He's crouched and invisible, and his gaze is pointed to where the motorcycles had been not so long ago. The shadows from the skewed headlights and, later, the jumping shadows from what he figured was some sort of flare had been too confusing to sort out. Still, if he'd had any energy left, he'd still have sent _something_ in that general direction and hang the consequences. However, the last teleport had all but drained him. _Getting fat and lazy, eh? Bloody hell..._

Clarity turns to find Dark Glow. She sighs, unable to spot him anywhere. "Dark Glow? Are you there? Are you okay?" She actually sounds a bit nervous. One might think she cared! "It's not funny," she adds, wondering if he's having fun at her expense.

DarkGlow's eyes focus on Clarity standing from where she had been crouching over Ghost Knight's apparently prone form. _Got himself whacked, did he? Wow. Note to self: stay away from motorbike dudes._ He stands, walks over to Clarity. She had said something; he hadn't really been paying attention. He grins a bit as her gaze wanders back and forth over his invisible form, then shrugs and drops the shadows from around him. "I'm here. You said something before?"

Clarity lets out a deep sigh, "Please don't do that to me again. I was hoping you might let me mind link with you. Shawntae knows where he is. On the top of a building on Fifth and Main. Sounds kinda like a trap to me. Could they somehow know that I'm linked to him, you think?"

DarkGlow shrugs. "You're new. I don't see how. And, no, you can't mind link with me. Last time I opened my mind or whatever I ended up on my back and bleeding like a stuck pig. Words work fine. 'On the top of a building on Fifth and Main.' See?"

Clarity sighs at Dark Glow. "Very well. Someday though, I hope you can decide to trust me. What do you think we should do? I may have a way to sneak myself in, but I don't believe I can get Shawntae out even if I make it that far."

"Well thats where I come in, sweets." Guy shrugs, "If you can get us in, I can get us out of there so fast, well, they wont even have time to shout one thing about honor or cowardice or the like. Why, Ill bet you ten," The detective checks a pocket, "Wait, make that fifteen bucks, that they dont have time to insult our honor, and that I get off a one-liner, by the time were out of there."

DarkGlow shrugs again. "What's trust got to do with it? Besides, I can sneak in and Guy can teleport in and skullface can float through the walls to get in. And if you can sneak yourself in, too, that's all of us currently in action. Tia and Tengu don't really sneak--probably for the best they're not here."

Clarity nods her head and sighs, "I can get myself in." She won't react to being called 'sweets'. Yet. She may later poor cottage cheese in Guy's shoes, however.

"Alright. But can you get the rest of us in? Heck, I don't even wanna go in my closet by myself... but that's for another reason entirely... still having friends helps..." Guy gives a chuckle. _I hope she doesn't pour cottage cheese in my shoes._

"I can only get myself in," Clarity says, frowning at Guy. "You will have to cart yourself in, unless Dark Glow or Ghost Knight want to carry you around."

DarkGlow shoots Guy a wry glance. "Having friends helps? Really? Heh--you're probably right." _'Cept when they have you plant flash bombs._ He glances at Clarity. "Guy can teleport in like the rest of us slobs. He doesn't need carrying. Babying, maybe. Carrying, no."

"Babying, carrying, whatever." Guy shrugs, "The point is, as long as we know where it is we're going, uhm... there we are?"

"Do you really do this often?" Clarity asks of Guy, "Or did they take you on cause you won some sorta contest?" She looks to Dark Glow, "Anyway, let's see what we will see. We can't really be in speaking range, so..." She won't even suggest it.

From the earth between the three, up rises the gleaming skull of the Ghost Knight, his coat flickering around him. **Shawntae is waiting on us.** Regarding the ntoe that Guy has, **Unless we take the time to translate this, Shawntae will need us now.**

DarkGlow nods agreeably at Guy. "If we know it, we're there. Beauty of stepping through shadows--or whatever it is you do." He sends a smirk Clarity's way. "Yeah, we won't be in speaking range. Darn, if only I'd brought my radio--oh, wait, here it is."

"Radio. Riiight." Guy checks to make sure his radio is working. (( Although you know this works just as well. Kinda nice you know. Comforting almost. )) Guy nods to the others, "I'm ready as you are." He looks at GK, then DG, "You two are okay, right? Looked like you got hit pretty hard..."

Clarity shakes her head, "If you are sneaking up using that's not exactly brilliant." She studies the note, looking for familiar symbols, trying to get the general idea of the message. (( Not to mention we don't have to talk out loud for this. ))

The symbols are not too familiar; a few of them. Building, Street... Fifth. Those are the best that Clarity can derive from the note itself.

DarkGlow laughs. "Only my pride got hurt--oh, and my eyes." He wills himself not to glance at GhostKnight. "But I'm fine now."

"Hey maybe we can find someone that speaks pictures..." mutters Guy, "Or, we could just dash off to the rescue. Whenever you guys are ready."

"Shall we go save Shawntae now?" asks Clarity. She shakes her head at the note and stows it away. "They aren't pictures, Guy, it's kanji and hiragana.. just.. nevermind." She might as well try to teach philosophy to frogs.

---

Shawntae - what likely is Shawntae according to him on the mind link - is kneeling on a platform, a bag over his body. It's only a foot or so high, wooden, and beneath it is a metal box. On four corners of the platform, inches from his position, are four cylinders. Surrounding the platform are six tall barrels, with EXPLOSIVE written on them in bold letters. No one else is in sight on the rooftop.

Clarity doesn't think this looks very promising. "They probably have Shawntae's platform rigged to blow up if we move him," she murmurs. "I don't suppose we can stop time, grab Shawntae, and leave the place to blow merrily on its own?" Just a thought.

"Actually... I think we can..." mutters Guy, taking a deep breath.

Guy says, "Or I can, at least. It'll take a lot out of me. But I think I could do it."

DarkGlow looks at Guy questioningly. "So you'd zip in, get him and then out again?"

"You think or you know?" asks Clarity. "We don't get a mulligan on this. You miss, Shawntae dies." She shivers a bit, sighing, "These gang types are real scum, aren't they?"

Ghost Knight walks towards the platform and its' setup. He projects his perception into Ming and Guy's mind. Three of the six barrels are filled with what he informs is highly flammable liquid, which would create a nasty fireball. They are connected to the metal box inside. He cannot tell what the pipes are connected to. **First, I will deal with the barrels.** (( Guy, then slow the cylinders, and retrieve Shawntae. ))

Guy considers, "Well, we could always work together..."

DarkGlow glances at GhostKnight. "Think you can scramble the detonators from inside or something?"

(( Alright then. As soon as you give me the signal, I'll sink 'em in time, grab Shawntae, and we'll be out of here. )) Guy projects this down the mindlink, then looks about. He takes another deep breath, and nods to Ming, "I know I can do this."

"Good," answers Clarity. She will trust Guy not to clown around at this time. "If any bad guys show up, I guess Dark Glow and I get to take them out, then." Well, she's somewhat capable of that.

**Something like that.** The Knight walks forward. **Shawntae, do not move.** The barrels themselves do not jar, but cracks begin to slowly spiderweb over the top of the barrels. The cracks grow, and as they do, an ugly liquid begins to filter upwards into the air. More rises, as though the barrels were tipped upside down. Flowing upwards into a ball in the air, it drifts down, and is funneled down a hole made into the roof, before stone seals over it. **It is now safe.**

"Great," DarkGlow replies. _What, disappointed not to be in on the rescue directly? Thought you'd like mixing it upwith goons better, no?_ Disquieted by that thought, turns his attention instead to any approaching intruders. _Well, defenders, actually, I guess._

Clarity will stay focused, letting her mind reach out as it tends to when she's bracing for danger. Softly she murmurs, "I feel my skin crawl. I've never felt like I was about to get caught in a trap before."

DarkGlow glances at her and, for a moment, sees a scared girl more than a threat to his sanity. "If it gets too hairy, bug out, regroup, charge back in and hit 'em from behind," he murmurs back.

Ming nods at Dark Glow and tries to steel herself. She can do this. It was easier before. She didn't have time to think about things. Even when she was injured before she didn't think of it as more than a game, but now it seems a lot less fun.

DarkGlow laughs softly. "Don't worry, it's only life and death. Nothing important." _How often have I done this? When did I become immune to such nervousness?_

(( Just life and death? Gee, I feel so warm and fuzzy inside. )) Shawntae is, if nothing else, not happy.

"I don't know what would happen to my sister if I didn't come home," Clarity whispers softly. At least she won't want for money. She wonders for a moment, then. Does her life insurance cover terrible death at the hands of gangs or super villains?

DarkGlow's mouth tightens. "Survive," he whispers back. "In the end, it comes quite naturally--especially in orphanages." He shrugs, irony lacing his tone. "Look at me."

_I, Guy Neville being of sound mind and body, do hereby bequeath_ Guy starts to perceive the world a little differently, letting things slip between ticks of the clock. This extends around the barrels, who for the moment find themselves locked in a precarious position, ready to explode, perhaps, but the nails are held, the timer is stuck, time will not pass for them. Nowhere near as fast as it will for Guy, who will zip up to rescue Shawntae, grabbing the poor fellow and then teleporting off of the platform. Quite the disappearing act. _And to the one known as the Ghost Knight, I leave my case files... to Ming I leave my recon work on super heros in the past... and to DG... I... waitasec... I'm not dead yet..._

As time takes place again - everyone taking cover - nothing happens. Ghost Knight broadcasting to the others along Ming's connection that the platform apparently had no pressure plate just beneath Shawntae.

Clarity frowns. "I can't let that happen to my sister. She lost her parents already. She's just starting to smile again." The telepath watches with more than a bit of trepidation, hoping that Guy is serious long enough to do this without killing the whole team. Seeing the success, she frowns. "Okay, why am I more worried. She explains to Dark Glow, "There was no pressure plate.. it was just a ruse. What are these jerks trying to pull?" She shakes her head, "Let's get out of here, and fast. I don't want to wait around one second."

Shawntae says, from inside the bag, "I am so doing the computer work from my place from now on."

"Yeah yeah. We'll see about that. Let's get out of here first. Something about this place gives me a major case of the heebie jeebies," mutters Guy, as he throws the bag off, and heads for safer ground with the rest.

(( You know, Shawntae, this is a lot of trouble to go through to try and get me in the sack with you. )) Clarity can't help but tease. (( I'm glad you are alright, too. )) She's kinda frayed at the edges, herself. "Can we please please go home now?"

DarkGlow comments, "The motorcycle guys are still here somewhere. Be ready--I don't think 'exit, stage right' is gonna be that easy."
