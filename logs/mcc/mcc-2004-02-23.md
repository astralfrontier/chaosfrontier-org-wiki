# Millennium City Chronicles 2004-02-23

"Good Morning Millennium city," Announced the anchor in the early hours of the morn. "In Top news, the MCPD made an enormous arrest later last night of close to thirty members of organized crime. The individuals had stockpiles of illegal weapons, and were trespassing on private property, which they happened to destroy. Incidentily, they were found unconcious, disabled, or otherwise unable to resist arrest, some even making a brief visit to the hospital."

"In other news, the city is gearing up to celebrate Detroit Day this Thursday: superheros and powered celebrities are flying in from across the globe to help commemorate the day of memory. Several events are planned, including a tornament at Club Pandemonium." "Sounds like a fun time, Janet, and now, the weather."

"Well now, there's a happy ending if I ever saw one." The news anchor disappears, fading to a black screen as Guy turns off his television. The detective taps his fingers idly, wondering, "Why'd anyone wanna write an article about me?" _At least GK warned me ahead of time. Here goes nothin'..._

As if on cue, the phone rings.

The detective looks at the phone as though it were a dog that just messed up the rug. He sighs, answers it, "Yeah?"

"Hello, Mr... Nevile, I'm with the Sunshine Life Insurance, and did you know that more people die from auto accidents yearly than..."

"Whoa hey! You're from the insurance company? Great! You're just the person I've been looking to talk to." Guy looks at the time, "Hey tell ya what, why don't you tell me all about your different policies, and all the little rules and regulations. I'm interested in buying a policy, but I wanna know every single option available to me..." _Who would have thought I'd be GLAD to hear from a telemarketer. Heh. Can't do an interview if I'm on the phone..._

"Ah... okay." Seemingly surprised with the results, the caller begins the long process of the first rate plan.

---

The rest of the team, along with Shawntae and Lydon Yamaguchi, are back at the warehouse. Already a few things are being packed up, and the Ghost Knight is directing a sort of demonstration, with a three-dimensional representation showing on Shawntae's computer. It's an underground network of tunnels, along with a large central area and a few smaller ones. **As has been seen, security is lax here,** explains GK. **There are those of us who would like to pursue our respective goals with some assurance of safety. The model you see before you represents an underground system of tunnels and chambers, which I will excavate, and which Mr. Yamaguchi has agreed to furnish. In other words, a sanctum. Nobody is required to make use of it; however, even the most paranoid of us--** and a glance in DarkGlow's direction signifies his thoughts **\-- should immediately realize the benefits.**

"Can I have my own room?" asks Clarity. She's ever one to be serious in all matters, after all! "With a really nice sound system, and a lab?" And one half-expects her to add: And a pony! She doesn't, thankfully. "It'll be just like all the comic book hideouts!" she adds enthusiastically.

DarkGlow drops the icy stare that GhostKnight seems determined not to acknowledge. "My apartment's my 'sanctum'. Frankly I don't care if we meet inside some local coffee shop."

Shawntae leans back in his chair. "GK's assured me that this will be accessable and at the same time, is going to keep m- us safe from intrusion. Which is cool, because I don't feel like being bait for another ploy to get you shot." He peers sidelong at Clarity. "Depending on the music, sure..."

Lydon smirks towards DarkGlow. "I'm afraid Foxbat ruined that, to a degree."

DarkGlow looks at Lydon for half a second before deciding that it was actually funny. He chuckles. "Point. What about a place with a Chinese buffet, then?"

"That's a shock," mutters Clarity. "Foxbat screwed-up everything." As for Shawntae, she smiles sweetly at him, "Well, what kind of music do you like, hmm? If I can dance to it, it can't be all bad."

The cyberkinetic smiles back. "I'll agree to that."

**If it is inanimate, and I can obtain it without great difficulty, you may have it, and I will see to its installation. Laboratories and computer access; tunnels, leading out to Chinese buffet restaurants, if you insist. All are doable.** The Ghost's voice and 'face' are entirely flat. **You are on your own for ponies.**

DarkGlow glances at GhostKnight at that comment, looks to Clarity, then rolls his eyes. _Again, or still?_

"And, we will be moving all of Tia's equipment into the facility," Adds Lydon. Shawntae nods. "Yeah- all of her needed modifications and equipment are online and operational. I couldn't find anything in her, from database down. I'd have to chop her apart piece by piece, and I doubt she'd appreciate it."

"I wouldn't either," DarkGlow replies blackly. "How is she doing?"

"She's... Tia," Shawntae can only reply to. "It's hard to really get a read on her personality."

Clarity will just give DarkGlow a winning smile and wink at him. "You know you love having me around," she teases lightly. Still, her real attention shifts to Ghost Knight, since the others are talking about things of which she has no knowledge, "So... are pets allowed, then?"

DarkGlow replies, "I'm more concerned with her being able to walk and talk and do what she wants. Sparkling personalities don't score any brownie points with me."

"We can tell," Injects Lydon.

"That much is certainly true," murmurs Clarity quietly. Nothing is going to ruin her good mood, though. Not even biker ninjas.

**I would prefer the tunnels be kept clear of non-sentients,** replies GK softly. **This might sound paranoid, but they represent an avenue to detection, which defeats our purpose.**

"Yeah, she's up and around the lab. No doubt wants to move around and do something constructive; I've been modifying her a little with Lydon's help so that she can put her different attachments on with little assistance." Shawntae spreads his hands. "Still takes some time, but at least makes her less dependant."

DarkGlow scowls at Lydon, and regards Clarity. "Have you met her? She's a child--like someone's kid sister." He doesn't bother stressing any word. _If she doesn't get how I feel, then it's her problem._

DarkGlow snorts, rounding on GhostKnight. "Non-sentient? I seem to remember her sticking metal claws pretty far into some thug's chest for a certain detective's sake."

DarkGlow shrugs. "If that doesn't qualify you for the team, what does?"

**I refer to pets, not androids,** replies GK. **I do not object to Tia's presence.**

DarkGlow is caught off-guard. "Oh." He coughs. "Sorry."

Clarity tilts her head at DarkGlow, "I think you are jumping over the edge a bit, there." She shakes her head and asides to Ghost Knight, "If he keeps this up he'll have a heart attack by age forty, and he's probably even more grouchy when he's sick."

"Well... I dunno. I think it's neat and all... but I just have a funny feeling about living in basements. Still, I suppose it ought to be nice and secure." Guy pauses, strokes his chin thoughtfully. "We'll need a karaoke machine."

**... You are on your own for karaoke,** says the Ghost, firmly.

"So who is Tia? If she's like a kid sister, she ought to be taken care of by someone who actually knows how to raise a child," says Clarity. "Honestly, this whole save the city thing is not good for kids."

Guy says, "Well yeah. But I figure you've got a lovely singing voice GK. I wanna hear you and DG singin' a duet. It'll be great. One for the record books to be sure."

DarkGlow stares at Clarity in something close to shock. Slowly, he nods to himself as if still working through a maze of conflicting thoughts. With a shrug, he turns away.

Lydon watches this back and forth with a shake of his head. Turning towards the Ghost Knight, "You also want defense mechanisms, correct? Weaponry or just passive resistance?"

Clarity hmms thoughtfully as DarkGlow turns away. She is going to do something that may be unwisue, and step around to get in front of him again. Provided he doesn't do anything stubborn she'll look him in the eye and suggest, "You and I really have to talk."

Almost idly, Shawntae's computer screen flicks to two cats rolilng around, clawing at eachother, hissing and fussing. One's black and white, the other is the odd whitish blue of Clarity's uniform.

From her peircing glare, DarkGlow has to wonder if she can somehow penetrate the shadows masking his face. He folds his arms. _Classic defensive posture. Way to go, twit._ "No. We don't. I think you said quite enough when we were rescuing Shawntae. I don't recall denigrating your worries about your sister, despite the fact that I know that if you die, she'll do just fine. And now you mock _me_ for expressing concern for someone I feel can't fully fend for herself?" He shrugs. "Fine. So be it. It's not like I really care what you think. I'm just surprised you sucked me in during the rescue."

Guy decides to stay out of this one. Instead he heads over to Lydon and GK as the two are talking. He smiles, and asks, "How are you gentlemen?"

Shawntae decides Guy has - for once - the best idea. He rolls his chair, which was salvaged from the raid, over to the trio and joins in.

For himself, the Ghost is content to talk architecture, quietly bending an ear to the conversation nearby.

"You don't get it," says Clarity. "We're team mates now. Comrades. I'm not mocking your care for someone. I want this fighting to stop. As for not knowing Tia, that's your fault, not mine. It's not like you've made any effort to welcome me into this loose confederacy that is barely surviving as a team." Something that this last little episode made glaringly obvious.

DarkGlow laughs, shortly. "One, I don't see any fighting going on. I didn't even see an argument until you decided come over and confront me. I misunderstood GK, and I apologized. Two, I've not been able to Tia myself, for so long now that I'm not entirely certain of exactly what day I _did_ last see her. You not knowing Tia can hardly be my fault--I'd lay blame on Lydon, myself, but he doesn't seem too much the mad scientist type, so I trust he's not actually doing anything dangerous during her 'examinations'. Third, I thought our last little fracas went exceedinginly well, other than that flash-bomb bit, so I have no idea why you think we're 'barely surviving'."

"Did you miss the part where GhostKnight was nearly killed?" asks Clarity. "Or the time in the mall where Guy got smashed. Or when Foxbat shot me?" Come to think of it, Clarity can't really recall a time when their adventures didn't almost get one of them killed. "Anyway, I.. I give up." She sighs and turns away. "Forget about it."

**We are not merely barely surviving. Each of us could have died, if it weren't for the others,** points out GK, softly.

DarkGlow shakes his head in annoyance. "Fine--but riddle me this: how exactly how would droppng my brain into your little melting pot have stopped you from being shot? Or GhostKnight from being attacked by three blades at once? We're doing well enough, I should think."

"Exactly. I think we've gotten past the point of 'why am I putting up with these guys' and moved into the working together part of the team thing. It's a nice thing too. At least I think it is. Er and what are ya giving up anyway?" Guy looks confused. Shrugs.

"This isn't about the mind link," says Clarity. "But I'm giving up." She moves away to stand alone. "Am I needed for anything?" There are other places she'd rather be.

Lydon watches back and forth, and comments quietly to Shawntae, "I hesitate to sign them all up for one of those weekend retreats where they can grow together as a family."

After a few moments of silence, a strange and unnatural gurgle rises from the black-cloaked vigilante. He wobbles unsteadily, reaching out with fuzzy hands, then crashing over on his side to lie motionless.

_**Damn**, but she's frustrating!_ DarkGlow resists the urge to spit, and tries to calm himself as he opens his mouth to respond-- and instead asks, "Skullface?" He's moving in GhostKNight's direction before he can stop himself.

The fallen figure doesn't respond. As usual, there's no sign of breathing, so that doesn't tell one much.

"Er... he shouldn't be making those noises... should he?" Guy looks at DG, then GK, and then he wonders, "What's going on?"

DarkGlow says, "If you're faking, I'm not going to be happy..." He bends to feel for a pulse.

There's no pulse either, though that's not particularly unusual either.

Lydon halts. "Ghost Knight." Immediately he's crossing over to the skull-headed figure. "Ming, is he conscious?" The scientist squats down. "We don't have anything to resuscitate a corpse here."

(( Hello? Ghost Knight? You in there somewhere? )) Then Guy asks, "Well, wasn't he a corpse already? Maybe those ninja swords were poisoned."

DarkGlow scowls at Guy. "Him already being a corpse is about as likely as me being the Grim Reaper. Anyone know CPR?"

_Not normally needed in my line of work,_ DarkGlow reflects. _Maybe I should learn..._

"I can," replies Lydon, hands going to the Ghost Knight's mask. "But after what I saw last time... Clarity?"

DarkGlow shrugs. "I read about jamming a pen through the throat to get air past an obstruction. Not pleasant, I admit, but if we can't get his makeup or whatever off for the breathing bit..."

**Your concern is noted,** remarks the resonant pseudo-voice, filling the air. **Whether or not you wish to admit it, each of you cares about his fellow man, or at the very least his fellow teammates. Run away or hate me, if you must, but I rely on all of you now. Let's not argue amongst ourselves, please.**

DarkGlow stands, disgusted. "Yep. Not happy."

Clarity sighs and frowns at the demonstration. "I'm tired," she says simply. She looks over at Lydon and turns away again. "Is there anything we need to do right now?" she asks.

Lydon looks to Ghost Knight, offering a hand down to help him up. "There's the matter of Guy's possible cameo in the Millenium City Chronicle."

**Leave that to me,** says GK. Effortlessly he floats off the floor to his feet. **Guy and I will need to talk later, but this can be dealt with.**

(( It was a good try, but I think things will never change. )) Clarity sends to Ghost Knight. (( Sometimes one has to give up, especially since it's only going to make things worse. ))

The edge is off his voice, but almost solely to spite GhostKnight, DarkGlow recalls what he'd been about to say to Clarity, and says it. "You might want to consider something," he tells her, quietly but insistently. "I don't know what you know, but me, I never finished high school. And yet from your words and actions, it seems your side of this little debate is lacking. Possibly unwinnable. Just a thought."

Lydon sighs. "No, Clarity, nothing on hand at the moment."

"It is no longer of any consequence," answers Clarity. "I'm going to go change. I don't think I'll be needing the gear tonight."

DarkGlow says, "No, probably not. Go spend some time with your sister. She probably wonders if you've become a 'ghost' recently, like skullface here."

DarkGlow addresses Lydon. "Me, I want to go see Tia. I don't care if she's lying on some table like an inert lump of metal. I just want to see she's all right."

Lydon looks back at DarkGlow. "She's in my lab, at the moment. I think Shawntae left her surfing the web to learn more information about the world abroad."

Shawntae offers up, "I had a spam filter on there. So she won't be coming back with opinions on breast enlargements and refinancing your house."

DarkGlow grins wryly. "So she'll be an inert lump of metal sitting in a chair, drooling as she wanders through meaningless websites. Great. Actually, she probably can't drool. That's good, I suppose." He laughs a bit.

No one joins him. _Ah, well. If Guy had said it, it probably would have been funnier._ DarkGlow grabs Shawntae's arm. "Lead on," he says, and follows as Shawntae leads him off.

On the Ghost Knight's perception, he picks up something mechanical flying parallel to the warehouse along the side of the road.

**Just a moment. Something unusual is outside,** remarks GK. **Mechanical. Flying. Close.**

DarkGlow stops and turns. "Bluejay?"

The Ghost Knight seeks to investigate this. He sees rocket thrusters hurtling along the side of the street, closing in on a car. The thing looks like a humanoid bull, or more accurately, a minotaur. Sinking metal fingers into the car itself, the bull partially lifts it up, slowing down the velocity until the vehicle comes to a stop before a red light.

The car comes to a complete stop, and the driver rolls down her window. Behind her, several cars have come to a complete stop. "Female, do not proceed operation of this class A vehicle until you follow article C, F, and R of the mandate driving code. Namely: Put the child in a secure safety seat, disconnect your cell-phone, and keep your eyes on the road. Your left tail-light requires maintenance." The driver is, naturally, too stuned to reply.

DarkGlow hmms to himself. "Traffic cop. Never pictured that in my future..." he comments ironically. "Shall we take him down or invite him into this team? Or would he have to pass a teamwork exam before we made any offer?"

Clarity stops, shaking her head as she hears the thing speak. "God I hate this town," she mutters softly. "Is everybody certifiable or what?" She rolls her eyes and adds, "Let me guess, this is one of those out of town nutcases."

"Furthermore, please be courteous to your fellow driver from now on." The minotaur unearths a snort, clouds of smoke billowing from the enormous nostrils. The woman complies, leaning over the seat and buckling her youngster into the back seat - quite difficult, when he wants to gawk at the big metal bull thing. "Have a nice day. Do not disrupt current mandated driving code. I mean it." With that, the robot smooths over the holes in the car, its' hand growing white-hot and melting the metal until it can smooth the marks over. Stepping back, as the car shakily pushes forward, one limb raises to acknowledge the others.

The mechanical thing leaps over the road seamlessly, an eruption of fire easing it down without a crunch. "Irresponsible drivers who don't put children in seatbelts annoy this unit uncontrollably. Are you in town for the celebratory events scheduled within several days?"

**Halt!** The voice is loud and authoritative, ringing clearly over the street. Perched on a rooftop overlooking the road is the speaker, black coat hanging over the edge. Beside him are his teammates.

If she was shocked before, Clarity is now blown away. She just stares at the 'unit'. "This unit is the stupidest piece of mmph-" Before she can finish that thought and enter her total tirade, her mouth is covered by Ghost Knight and she glowers at the dumb machine that has her so annoyed.

The robot simply stands there, looking upwards. "This unit is not stupid; that claim could be made if the operations processing module ran on Windows."

**What ordinances are you directed to enforce?** asks the Ghost, calmly.

"This unit has observed several laws, bylaws, and statutes before embarking upon travel from Hephaestos's maze. Any transgressions are to be politely questioned, with no force - the current mission is one of peace. However, severe transgressions from logical standpoints are to be carried out within reason. Several of the class A and B vehicles are in dire need of proper break and oil filter maintenance; suspicion that local mechanics are not doing efficent jobs. Such a conclusion would normally be met with changeline mechanics to offer free maintenance to next few vehicles in exchange for the balance as opposed to capitalistic misuse of power."

**Are you aware of the FAA regulations on flying vehicles?** asks GK, again calmly. **The statutes that require a license and flight-plan to be filed?**

Pulling away from the hand over her mouth, Clarity just peers at the robot for a while. "What is this, a socialistic robot? Hephaestos? The Greek God?" She looks over to Ghost Knight, "Just how many of these supers are actually just nutbars?" she asks. "This over-powered parking meter might hurt someone."

Thomas shrugs. **I'll find out momentarily. It seems interested in talking.**

DarkGlow looks at GhostKnight as if he'd let a few marbles roll down the street into the sewer. His gaze moves to the robot, then he looks up at the others on the rooftop opposite, over to Clarity and finally down at himself. _Why do I have a sudden urge to run, not walk, to the nearest department store to buy a pair of blue jeans and a T-shirt?_

"Rodger dodger. This unit doesn't fall under such codes, but they were checked to ensure that this unit didn't get shot down by trigger happy American pilots on the lookout." The minotaur shakes its head. "Incorrect; no force intent on actual harm shall be executed by this unit for the time being within the city unless receiving orders otherwise. The G.U.D.A. meeting on Thursday March 17th 2003 will be attended by this unit, as representative of Greece."

**What is G.U.D.A.?** asks GK.

"Governmental United Defense Agency. Once under UN sanction until split to form a coalition for global defense."

"You gotta be kidding me," Clarity murmurs. "GUDA? This certainly does reek of cheese, I'll give it that." Guy really should be proud of that remark. "So who built this goofy-looking toy, anyway, I wonder.."

"Look, can the cheesy remarks already. There's something very sharp about this guy's design. I'd go so far as to say we should brie careful around this fellow." Guy nods, "And besides all these rules and regulations are really au gratin' on my nerves..."

A black-gloved hand smacks Guy in the back of the head from out of nowhere. He may be fast, but the Ghost is no slouch. **Now. What would compel you to return to your origin?** he asks of the mechanical thing.

Clarity snickers a bit and decides to start wandering about the robot, just to see if it can be irritated. "So do you have a personality, or are you just a servant program of some random inventor?" she asks. "And why do you do such rash things when your appearance could frighten people and cause an accident?"

"This unit expects a Swiss pun shortly. A more formal introduction would be better; Hephaestos named this unit Bruciach, English translation: Cinder." A pause, Cinder tilting its' head to the Ghost Knight. "March 18th at 8 AM, excessive damage to this unit's onboard computer to cause backup program to initiate, summoning signal from the Maze, or this unit gets its' metallic backside dented by a matador."

"Ow." Guy rubs the back of his head. "What was that for?" The detective looks down at the robo-bull. (( So uh... what's with the cow guy anyway? ))

**Describe the characteristics of a summoning signal,** suggests GK. He seems rather interested in not provoking a fight, but in truth there's an element of curiosity - a machine that can be reasoned with is not a risk to those around him.

"This unit is aware of the reactions of humans around it, and thus is careful. If this unit had stepped out in front of the traffic violator, she would have slammed on her breaks and the child would have been possibly hurt. Thus the flashy entrance. Personality? Depends. Four out of five Internet users cannot tell the artificial intelligence of this unit, but that isn't saying much." A momentary pause. "A flash into the internal computer's processing modem, in greek, followed by a 'Yee Ha'. The last entry is not true; this unit recognizes the possible presence of "cow boys". The potential to meet similar creatures as this unit is promising."

Shrugging off his longcoat, the Ghost drops to street level, holding the garment out like a cape, and waving it at the matador. **DarkGlow, Ming, hold it if it comes. We're going for option three.**

DarkGlow shakes his head. "I'm going back inside to see Tia." _Wish I could just go home, until all the new whackos in town do the same..._

Cinder haults a moment, and seems to peer at the flashing cloak with suspicion. Then a billow of smoke erupts from the minotaur's nostrils, as one chrome hoof slams onto the concrete, sending out little cracks through it. "Matador detected. Current operational mode: Offensive. Optimal battle-cry: Booyeah!" The broad-shouldered mechanic bursts towards Ghost Knight, head lowered towards the cape. The horns stab into the flapping material, as the Ghost Knight's gloves clamp upon those enormous tusks. One upward thrust of it's head sends the vigilante over its' shoulder, before his arms sink through the internal machinery to sink intot he back of it's hips and pull outwards, causing the machinery to cave inwards.

The Ghost's voice quavers for a moment; is that his normal voice, or James Earl Jones? **All too easy.**

"Internal pelvic mechanism and onboard defensive locomotion operational system disfunction." Thrusters on the underside of the minotaur erupt. "Maintenance required for this unit. Maze bound." It blasts upwards.

---

A young boy. Daniel, pushing through the weeds. Hide and seek is one of his best games; mainly because he can find the best hiding places, sometimes in the most obvious of areas. As he wiggles beneath a bush, something catches his attention: car doors slamming. Looking through the shrubs, there's several men. They look angry. They're shouting stuff, something about money and freaks and... They've got some other man in a straight jacket. He looks woozy, stumbling everywhere, his eyes are bloodshot and dilated and... they meet Daniel's.

DarkGlow wakes up. He stands in the white-washed halls of a hospital, smelling of chemicals and cleaning products, peering through the window into the room of several people in beds. None of them move, all have machines hooked to them, measuring heart rate and other vitals.

DarkGlow blinks woozily. _Gotta remember to stop drinking..._ He rubs his eyes. _Oh, yeah. I never started..._ He glances down. _Dressed, check. Well, if I've started sleep-walking, at least I'm not doing it nak-- No, I was meditating. Is my phantom friend jerking me around again?_

DarkGlow looks through the window again. _Patients in a hospital._ He glances at his gloves--clean. _Of course they are, whether I did it or not. I'm probably supposed to go in, since something went to the trouble of getting me here--much as I feel like disappointing them, this time I'll bow to curiosity._

DarkGlow drifts through the room, checking the charts. So far, the majority of the people in the room are in terminal comas, some due to mental attacks, others by loss of concious processes. They appear to be under study to understand the lasting effects. None of the patients' names look familiar to DarkGlow.

_Wonder what Clarity could dig out of them. Or the female DarkGlow, come to that. Likely wind up here myself if I tried anything, though._ He notes the patients' names and quietly leaves the hospital, meaning to look up what he can on them at a later time.
