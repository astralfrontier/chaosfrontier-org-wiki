DarkGlow spends some time looking over the medical charts, and taking the names, does a little checking of the patients backgrounds. Nothing even feels remotely familiar to him. No names connect to any he's known - possibly some connection to some victim under his weapon, but nothing by name, this he is certain of. To the conditions, however, it's interesting that the hospital patients themselves are in comas, either from the ill-results of Mentalists, or otherwise.

_Great,_ DarkGlow thinks, sitting back from another fruitless examination of yet another blind alley. _Hey, phantom buddy: unless you're meaning me to acquire my female self's powers and then become Florence Nightengale to these poor sods, I'm kinda missing the point. Don't suppose you do ouija boards...?_ He groans as another idea hits him. _Ah, man... again with that nightclub? Wonder if they'd be any more successful than, say, Shawntae at connecting these comatose dots..._

The people of Little China are aware of the posters situated throughout their neighborhoods. However, either to keep the Tongs' wrath minimal, or to simply be respectful, they mind their own business. But for a select few who wear the colors of the Tong, the message is a clear calling card. "You fools were deceived. Come back for a fair fight, if you can handle it." Calls are made. That evening, the just beyond the construction site itself, the quiet purr of a motorcycle's engine fills the night, the trio perched, waiting, their lights off.

Walking out of the darkness of the construction area are three figures. In the middle is the author of the posters; not the black-cloaked stalker, but a golem of living stone, walking ponderously. **We are here. If we are defeated, I will apologize and do honor to the fighting Tongs. And if you fall?**

"Then the Tongs admit defeat. You are a worthy foe, and they will not openly challenge you again." It is matter of fact. Almost scripted.

The stylized stone figure inclines its head. He raises an arm, fingers outstretched, and simply beckons invitingly.

DarkGlow tries not to laugh, sigh, shake his head or any other action which would make him feel a little less like he was in some sort of Western. _You mean Eastern, no...?_ He tightens the shadows around him and prepares to receive an attack--_Like a moron, or other assorted good guy..._

The motorcycles are off like a shot, but rather then staying in an obvious line, the three weave back and forth, slowing down and speeding up almost like a pre-assigned dance. They all drive for the center, and then deviate to the side; the one on the far right speeds up before the others, dropping into a skid towards DarkGlow. Another, when just close enough, hits the brake, propelled into an arc with sword outstretched, while the other weaves around the other two, coming in from the other side towards the shadow manipulator.

The Golem moves swiftly, its stone body shifting at unnatural speed. A stone leg lashes out to kick one biker off his bike, and a rocky fist swings upward to catch another in midflight.

The skidding rider doesn't go far, knocked over the bike and rolling to their feet. The other, however, went flying to hit the ground rolling. The actual driver wheels by DarkGlow, the sword lashing for a moment and slicing through the umbra shield surrounding him, before driving past.

Ming doesn't wait around for the attackers to get shots in. She sees one man up on his feet, and so she attacks. Her mind reaches out, tearing into her foe's, and a great numbing cold will suddenly seize the biker.

DarkGlow eyes widen as he realizes that all three are targeting _him_. _What the devil did I ever do to them? Other than showing up here, I suppose..._ Gritting his teeth, he braces for the attack--and when GhostKnight knocks two down before they reach him, he mentally scratches that flash bomb debacle off his score-sheet. He twists to take the sword slash of the incoming biker and the shadows dull the strike to a hard thump, rather than something considerably more lethal. Spinning as the rider drives past him, DarkGlow flings shadows after him to blind him. From a sudden wobble in the bike's movement, he guesses he succeeds.

As the shadows swarm it, the motorcycle stops. It's only a few moments before the rider steps off, blade in hand, and simply turns, taking a few slow steps towards the three, then taking up a fighting stance.

The biker tries but fails to slip aside as DarkGlow siezes him in shadow. With a grin--an unpleasant one--DarkGlow lifts him off the ground entirely. _Fly to heaven--or break loose. Which shall it be...?_

The animated rock-man pauses, rather than pressing his own attack. Again he gestures, fingers outstretched, signalling the once-proud warriors to recover and rise to their feet.

Ming doesn't sit idle. She sweeps out with her telekinetic powers, grasping at first one, and then another. One blade leaps across the ground and away, thrown away from its would-be handler. The other is tugged, but the biker manages to keep a grip on it for now.

The Golem moves again, swinging, and his point is made - rather than confront and fight him, his target evades nimbly. The blank stone face shows nothing, but inside, Thomas is already grinning. This battle is nearly won.

Ming doesn't seem to believe in missing. At least not in this battle. She turns her mind to focus on the nearest biker, and her thought bends on him, sending a terrible icy numbness in him that drives all concious ambitions away once more. She can keep this up a long time.

DarkGlow eyes the swordsman dangling from nothing up in the air. _So... how badly does he want to die?_ He shouts upwards, "You had your chance, I had mine. I think I won. If you think so as well, drop the sword and surrender--or grow wings."

The rider does so - by cocking back and hurling the sword. From the hight, and all the strenght put into it, it sails over the trio to plant itself point down. The airborne fighter eases to his feet, and pulls it from the ground, conveniently having a new sword. Even though his comrad has been grounded by Clarity's mind, he is still able to fight.

Eyes narrowed, DarkGlow watches the rearmed fighter while he drags the other back to earth at something a little less than a breakneck speed. _If I have to attack, you still drop buddy boy._

Ming actually sighs. "Idiots." Again she lashes out, and again a man loses his grasp on the world. "Can we end this? I'm getting bored."

**Enough. Choose to withdraw now, or continue to punish yourselves,** challenges the Ghost, stepping out of his stony shell.

"The Armored Ghost is a worthy foe," Replies a woman's voice from DarkGlow's descending grasp.

DarkGlow shoots a surprised glance at Ming's words. _Bored so soon? Next time_ you _face the bloody swords, then._ The biker-without-wings touches the ground with a respectable jar, but nothing injurious. DarkGlow throws a quick, shallow bow at his opponent, while readying to skewer him if he doesn't stay surrendered--or her, it seems.

**Restrain yourselves from now on,** says GK, his dead voice ringing harshly in the cool air. **You are mortal, and fight with swords. I am not, and my weapons are everything that exists. You will not find me so merciful again.**

The other two regain their feet, and agree to the terms. Only a few moments are spared glancing about for the sword, before their bikes are taken up, and into the night they ride, leaving the three behind them.

DarkGlow clears his throat, then offers to GhostKnight, "Thanks for that first bit. I don't think I'd like getting thumped by three swords at once any more than you did..."

"That was a bummer. I really was hoping to keep a ninja sword for my office," says Ming. Her tone makes it impossible to tell if she's joking or serious.

**My condition has its advantages,** replies the Ghost. **But that is what teammates are for. Come. Let's rest and celebrate.**

DarkGlow replies, "Appreciate the offer, but I've someplace to stop first. Catch you around..."

Clarity sighs softly and hms. She nods to Dark Glow, "Well, maybe some other time." She scratches her head and looks back to Ghost Knight, "So anyway.. that was pretty easy."

The Ghost smiles. **With us working together, of course it was.**

DarkGlow opens his mouth to say something like "--and no brain mix-mastering required!", but decides to let it be. With a shrug and a wave, he walks off.

"Still.. I was really hoping to get some ninja tropheys," says Clarity. "I mean, aren't they supposed to have a bunch of stuff that they should drop around whenever they get their tails kicked?" They have totally ruined her esteem of biker ninjas.

DarkGlow calls over his shoulder, "There's one in the shadows over there. Wash it carefully or the cops may ask why you've got a sword with blood on it..."

Just when all hope seems lost, Clarity gets hope from.. Dark Glow? Did hell freeze over when she wasn't looking? Who cares! It's her ninja sword! She will snoop around a bit and then brandish the sword with a grin. "Nifty! And there shouldn't be any blood on it, I don't think.."

DarkGlow laughs as he continues walking away. "Don't be naive; it likely has lots--though admittedly none from tonight."

A moment before he vanishes into the shadows, his shade's blade forms around his hand and he glances down at it. _Honest steel holds the blood, even if invisible to the eyes. This cannot, and the blood is forgotten. Which is truly better, I wonder? Which?_
