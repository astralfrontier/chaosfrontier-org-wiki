One of the hospitals in Millennium city, Earlanger, has a sophisticated rehabilitation clinic. The best physical therapists in the state can be found to have a desk here, but right now, two are missing. Here, Bobby Thayland, a once paraplegic, cannot be found here either. The trio can however be found in a nearby park. Bobby has been working hard, at first using just his arms, doing relaxing things like feeding birds, manipulating cups, putting his own shirt on. These are advanced things, but the clinic lets patients choose their own goals to work towards them. For now, the therapists are taking a smoke break, leaving Bobby to overlook the grounds.

For his part, Thomas Temple likes surprise. Shock and confusion arise from a sudden change in situation. It's the power of his armor and persona, but this time it's counter-productive. He opens, instead, with something innocuous. A fluttering piece of paper, propelled by an uncannily smart wind, blows its way over the grounds, landing on the man's lap. It's half-folded, and reads: EXPECT COMPANY IN ONE MINUTE, DO NOT BE SURPRISED.

The new man notices the paper, and rather than just curiously picking it up for a read, he takes his time as though it were a ceremony or an art, slowly unfolding the paper and tilting his head to read. Leaning back, Bobby looks around casually while tearing the note in half.

The requisite minute passes, and slowly, a black shape rises from the ground before Bobby. The Ghost inclines his head, and gestures. **May I join you?** he asks.

Bobby pats the seat on his bench. "Sure thing."

Thomas sits calmly, taking up a comfortable angle on the bench and leaning back. **I came to ask you how you were doing,** he says without preamble. **In addition, if there is anything further you require.**

His voice is still gruff and harsh, but the electronic voicebox is no longer a crutch. "I'm great. I can move again. Dew and crew are in jail. For several years at least." Complete and utter appreciation floods Bobby's face. "Thank you."

**Remember what it feels like,** suggests the Ghost, quietly. **And, in the fullness of time, if you are able and willing, consider offering the same benefit to other people. If you retain the abilities that drew our attention, and if you believe in justice and fair play, there would be many who owe you a great debt of gratitude.**

Bobby nods. "I received a note from a man on the phone. He made me an offer. Use what I have now not in violence, but in surveillance." The explination is stating of a fact. Simply looking back at the Ghost Knight, "I havn't decided."

The black figure nods. **You have much time to consider it. In the meantime, does your family require any assistance?**

A shake of his head no. "My sister keeps on working. I am taking care of myself little by little, so some stress is off of her. We're better. How about you? I tune into the radio whenever I hear about you."

**I am still bound by my nature,** the ghost replies softly. **But I am content. There is a price for what I do, but I pay it gladly.**

"I understand about prices." Bobby reclines back. "Just nice to see I can cash in on the interest." A look over his shoulder, "The doctors are coming back."

The Ghost is gone by the time Bobby's gaze returns; he's heard what he needed to hear, and he's well content. Let the legend of the invulnerable, invisible ghost live just a little longer, even in the heart of a friend.

Foxbat is ready to run his suit through a shredder at this point. No one seems to appreciate his own Master Plan. The last two weeks have taken him from the Terrifying Villain of Wickedness to the laughing stock of the funny pages! When he went to kidnap the Mascot for Keedle Cookies, his glider wings had holes in them, sending him into a wall. When he went for his trusty Gum Ball, it blew up in his hand, and getting THAT mess out of his clothes was unbefitting his genius. The children at the event took that moment to tickle him in masse. And that was just Tuesday.

The triumphs of yesterday seem few and far-between; the memories of them magnify the negatives and the failures. But Foxbat has another side-line, one he has distant memories of from an earlier age, and in his somewhat clouded life now, he's given them another try. Comic-book publishing, via an independent press and over the world-wide network, is something that a lot of people have tried. One afternoon he decides to give it a try for himself. His plans are good, but people don't seem to like them at all. So he sits down, gets pencil and paper, and starts working.

The sketches are executed with the same surety of hand that has kept Foxbat alive and in one piece during his career as a supervillain. Wielding weapons and making acrobatic leaps have certainly improved his coordination, and he's amazed at the speed and dexterity of his artistic endeavors. Early pencil sketches for a comic concept come to life without hesitation, and his success is only compounded during the inking. Unsure of just when and where he got proficient at such artistry, he hesitates before committing his final work to the scanner. Nevertheless, there it appears, on the screen of the computer he has. A few emailed missives, along with his portfolio, start eliciting interest from publishers in Millennium City.

The drawings are surprisingly well-received. The man who sometimes calls himself Foxbat knows what a villain is truly like, and has the talent to make his wild dreams come to life. In a short time he's getting requests for more work and new ideas. Plans that would have caused embarassing failure in reality work perfectly in literature, crafted by the kind of coincidences and fate that the world very rarely provides.

He struggles with the writing, of course, and with expectation comes excitement. Here he is making dreams real and finding that he can actually have a profound impact with his audience. He immerses himself in literature to compensate. Classics as well as more modern works are consumed with fervor. There are good ideas everywhere. Like all writers, the man who was once Foxbat realizes that the good writers borrow, and the best steal. There are endless sources of inspiration.

The rewards of comic-crafting aren't all intellectual. He attends conventions, where his work is well-received; occasionally he's invited to speak, either as a guest of honor, or as part of a round-table discussion. Women who would have run from him before in a mask are now smiling at him with friendly expressions; children and teenagers write to him and to the editorial back-page of his publication, enthusing about the stories he tells. The memory of mockery and ridicule from some strata from society is still strong, but that feeling is locked away in a mask and costume tucked carefully into a closet somewhere. In an age of superhumans, the comic-book writer is the man of the people, and his fiction will be read by everyone. His ideas are being accorded praise and interest.

The man who was Foxbat awakens. He feels sleepy. Looking around him, in the quiet farmhouse, he feels a little alone. But out here in the country air has given him some thoughts. Sitting down at the table, for once his brain isn't like a constant, shallow stream of ideas, but instead a deep pool. After the last thing he had done - the theft of the Zirconium, and had brought into being all other sorts of copies, it made him wonder what other hims are out there. Are they all Foxbats? What else could he be doing, because when was the last time his Master Plan actually worked? Generally the villain of villains is never depressed, or gives much thought to things that don't succeed because they are just erased from the Master plan. But now, the Master Plan is changing. Sure, stealing and causing crowds to cower and beating guys up are fun, and aiming the pingpong ball gun at a costumed do-gooder is a thrill in and of itself, is it worth it? Foxbat doubts, for the first time, how much of a villain he is.

"Does Foxbat mean clown, to the people of Millennium City, the country, the world?" No matter how much he tries, the world will not craft itself to his outcome, it has always been his doing. But what if he could craft the world himself? Not through finding some means, but simply... Going through drawers, he finds a pen and paper, and puts the visions of himself in success onto paper, for someone to see how he sees himself.

From his vantage point, Thomas takes a few notes, then greets Ming as she withdraws from her telepathic trance. "It seems to be working," he says, casually, offering a cup of tea. "But we're going to need something more for the next part. I think I know what's needed. Want to come with me?"

Ming raises an eyebrow and stretches. "Sure. I want this to work. Deep down, I think he's not really bad at all. Just.. confused, I guess." The telepath smiles and waits for Thomas to elaborate patiently.

The car pulls up to the curb and parks, beside an unassuming suburban residence. The roof is low and sloped; the house itself is a long, squat artifact of three decades back, though painted to hide some of the worst excesses of the era. The lawn is well-trimmed. Tom climbs out, looking around and shading his eyes from the sun. "This is my dad's house," he says, calmly, glancing back down into the car. "C'mon."

Ming is rather surprised, but she smiles. "Well, I suppose I owe him a visit. I hope I'm dressed properly?" She dressed for the session, which is too say plain as can be. Black and white so her mind wouldn't become distracted in her work.

The house is spacious, and well furnished. Nothing would be less. The house is relatively empty, which Tom knew from the start, except for his father, who meets them in a living room. He is getting well dressed, a button up shirt and slacks. Adjusting his tie, the older Temple gives the two a looking over. "It's nice to see you again, Ms. Ming. Thomas."

"You know what we're doing, with Foxbat," Thomas says. It's not a question. "I came to ask about it, in your capacity as psychologist. I know when my own limits have been reached, and I'd like to defer to a wiser mind before making a clumsy move."

Ming bows to Thomas' father. She stays quiet, letting Thomas do the talking. She would rather not make this any more difficult for Thomas than she imagines it already is.

"You're making a valiant effort," offers Thomas's father almost absently. "I won't tell you that you'll succeed, but from what I can tell, you might not fail either. You well know the mind is tricky, like a wild animal. Even if you tame it, it can still buck against your conditioning." He looks at Ming, as though saying their own gifts aren't immune to that. "The dreams are a good touch. Give him a few thoughts that he would think are his own, and let him find it himself, and you have a good chance."

"There's something further," says Thomas, sounding rather more bold than he feels. "Ming is a telepath. I understand she's had no formal mentoring in telepathy or psychic abilities in general. Is it possible for her to find a mentor, one that will accept a colleague relationship with her?" This is Tom's thinly-disguised expectation that if any such teaching happens, his teammate will not be condescended to.

Ming looks aside at Thomas, but manages to cover her surprise. She wonders just how great an idea this is. That is, if Thomas is implying what he seems to be.

On his heels, Richard gives Thomas a look, as though fully aware of the connotations. "There is a man I know who calls himself The Doctor. He handles situations like this, as well as more severe cases. He is not in town often, but he does correspond in various forms."

Thomas nods slowly. "Such an arrangement would be between Ming and.. the Doctor," he says, "if she agreed to it. I appreciate the referral."

Ming will just listen at this point and remain quiet. She seems to have a talent for silence when she's around Thomas' father. She can't help but wonder just how awkward a situation Thomas is landing her in.

"He will be a better mentor then I would be to your teammate." Putting on his tie, "I'm going to a dinner this evening. Would you like to come?" The question directed obviously at both of them.

Thomas gestures at Ming, leaving the decision up to her. He smiles a little, but stays silent. _That he'd even consider such a thing is interesting._

Ming looks down over herself, "I would love to, but I would need a chance to get into something more appropriate. I look rather too drab for fine places." She smiles apologetically, "I could get ready rather quickly, though, if you wish to stop at my place on the way?" He does know where it is, after all.

Richard gestures to Thomas. "He can pick you up, and I'll meet you there. It's a banquet at the De La Carouse. It's starting in..." Checking his watch, "An hour and a half. You can be fashionably late if you hurry."

Thomas just smiles. "We'll make it," he says.
