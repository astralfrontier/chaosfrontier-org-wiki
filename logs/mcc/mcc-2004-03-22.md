# Millennium City Chronicles 2004-03-22

Maggie's Eat'n'Greet is a quaint little diner. While not completely fifties style, some relics do exist, like the juke box which looks like a renevated record player, the old coke sign dating back to the 1950s, but they are more trophies of the past than the norm. The place is bustling, with the early morning "grab something before work" in a hurry crowd. And smack dab in one corner is Guy, waiting for answers.

The famed... well maybe not so famed detective Guy Neville has been gracing Maggie's Eat'n'Greet for the last good long while. He's been patient and quite amicable about the whole thing. At least until it becomes apparent that Dock isn't showing up. _Where is the guy?_ He gets up to call his rival's office, finds it busy. "Gah. He's probably still at the hospital. Which one did he say it was?"

The detective then goes to put his jobskills to good use. He cals around, trying to dig up the whereabouts of Harvey Dock and his sister... at least once he's reached the relative safety of his own office. It never hurts to be a little paranoid, especially when they may be out to get you.

The detective finds that Dock's sister is still in St. Hopkins' hospital. But using the phone to have the nurse summon Harvy proves unfruitful; according to her, and she checked twice, the detective wasn't there. Infact, when Guy has her ask the mother's husband, Dock left last night, around seven in the evening.

_Huh. Well that's strange. Left around seven in the evening..._ Guy opens a desk drawer, draws out his trusty gun, double checks it to make sure it's loaded. He then holsters it, and heads on over to Dock's office. _I hope I'm wrong about what I think I'll find..._

No knock summons Harvy Dock to his office door. The lock is free, and once Guy gets up the nerve and pulls the door open, the receptionist's desk is empty. The place doesn't look turned upside down, but reasonably neat and tidy. The phone, while not thrown across the room, is off the hook slightly, as if a reasonable bump would have disconnected it. Behind the secretary's desk is Harvy's office, likewise empty. Notes are strewn across the desk haphazardly, looking much like the disorganized organization of the Dock himself.

_Well that's a relief. Maybe. Or it could be the sure sign of a truly criminal mastermind. Why turn the place upside down and let everyone know what you've found, when you can make it look neat and tidy._ Guy looks around, pondering. He will not go so far as to turn the place upside down, but he will look for things that could be out of place, or missing. At the very least he's curious as to what his rival was up to as he peeks at the notes.

Various cases. Not just the standard detective fare, but also investigating discrimination cases, accusations of corporate crime, this and that. Though Guy does find something paticularly interesting. "Grothe Memorial Orphanage, Sierra Kansas. 3:PM. Director Adam North." It's dated a week ago. The name stirs memories inside Guy. His childhood. The director's different, but...

"Hmmm. Grothe Memorial Orphanage... now why does that..." Guy turns around suddenly, gun pointed at the door. He blinks a bit, _Well okay now we know this isn't a movie._ Guy replaces his gun, then sighs. _Well, I guess its time to go find Toto. I'm going to Kansas._

Ming stares at the rather roughed-up woman in front of her. She usually remembers people, but in this case.. "Okay, everyone in my room. Now." She's not going to let her sister see this mess. And if anybody thinks of testing her control of this situation, she will get in their head in a very nasty way.

DarkGlow's--Daniel's--heart freezes as that voice echoes in his head, an avalanche of memories suffocating his very thoughts. Still as brittle ice he waits, eyes open and staring, waiting for _her_ to appear.

In steps the woman, her hair seeming put back after once being disheveled. She looks like a poster child for some trendy biker shop; a leather jacket, some insignia beneath, jeans and boots. For the most part, they all look brand new. For DarkGlow, this means they're stolen. She steps in, her blue eyes cold yet wild, like an arctic storm. She surveys Ming, then turns to DarkGlow, seeing him in the Khaki. The smirk isn't there, but the two know it would be all too well. Without a word, she walks towards the hallway, where she suspects Ming's room to be.

Ming will lead the way to her room, wondering just what the hell she's gotten herself into. She imagines she'll have to call in sick today. This super hero stuff is so over-rated. Once everyone is gathered into her room, the door is firmly shut and Ming says, "Okay. What the hell is going on?"

Said arctic storm rages through Daniel and with even the briefest touches by her gaze, the ice inside him is shattered. Somewhere distant he wishes for the heat of rage, but it does not come. Cold, almost shivering, he follows. The motion is ragged, lurching, as if the remnants of icy splinters tear at him with every movement that brings him closer to her.

"That's what I would like to know." Her voice is terse, trying to control something raw and on the edge. "One minute, I'm standing on a roof, wondering why I came here. The next, I'm not in my own skin anymore, and I can tell who you are," She points at Ming, "And where you were. And then all hell broke loose." At least there she is telling the truth; parts of her face are starting to turn purple where bruises are starting to color.

Ming hmms thoughtfully. "So there was a mind link," she says simply. "Last night I made contact with.. someone for the first time. And lo and behold, there were other minds already running rampant in their head. You must have been in that link. I imagine you had some interesting powers that are now absent."

The purple on her face facinates Daniel; once he'd even found it inspiring. Some thug had managed to land a blow on Sasha and the next day, the disfigurment of her face had driven him into a rage. The thug was found and dealt with. The remembered rage does not warm him.

"To say the least," Nightstar replies, anger and confusion muted like a gloved fist. As if the train of thought had switched tracks, she turns towards Daniel, and merely watches him for several moments. "Hello, DarkGlow." From someone who knows her, it's clear she's agitated that he hasn't said anything to her, but expression or tone wouldn't give that away.

"Daniel," he whispers. "Daniel," he says again, louder. Tearing his eyes away from her is like removing a tongue stug to a flagpole in winter, but he manages it. "Ming," he continues, "this is Sasha."

"It's good to meet you, Sasha," says Ming. "Well, now it's clear you two know each other. You care to tell me anything else of use?" The telepath frowns thoughtfully, "Right now my best guess is that there is a third party still missing from this group who knows more of the story, but perhaps we can piece this together yet."

"NightStar," she corrects, and DarkGlow can nearly feel the room getting colder. A look is shot his way that could melt him to the spot, but her tongue is stilled for the moment as Ming continues. "I saw something, when everything went wrong. I was young, and I saw a man being shot, one I didn't remember before."

"Sasha," Daniel says, "Ming is also known as Clarity." It is a feeble warning, one meant more to protect Ming than anything else. Telepath or no, Ming's remaining life could easily be about as long as the distance between the two women. Knowing, having verified, that Ming is a super, Sasha might hold herself back a bit more than otherwise, now that she, like Daniel, seems to lack power. But probably not.

Ming laughs a little and hmms thoughtfully. "Well, if there is a third mind, we should probably consider ourselves in danger." She sighs softly and says, "In other words, we rea-"

A knock. From the other side, "I'm leaving for school."

Sasha stops, and licks her lips. For all the world it seems like a viper testing the air. But she seems to square her shoulders a little more, as if trying to shed the tension thick enough enough to swim in.

Daniel squares himself to NightStar automatically, the door between him and her. His head dips belligerently. _What the hell do you think you're doing?_ he asks himself. _She has no power,_ comes the reply. _And your point is...? That's **Sasha** over there!_

"Have a good day at school," replies Ming, smiling to herself. She's in so much trouble. Maybe she can convince Jiaojuan that she was just trying to get Daniel in the sack. It'd be less damaging than the truth.

From further through the apartment, "Bye!" Before the door slams shut. "We're in danger," replies Sasha with enough force to move. "It came after me when the ... link shattered."

"So what?" Daniel's voice twists in his throat, the sound almost cracking from the strain. "So what? When the shadows fled from me I didn't know whether to laugh or cry or be brave or just walk out into traffic. The last would have been easiest, all things considered. Why shouldn't we just wait here for some super to come get us? And why should we--" His voices chokes. "Why should _I_ care about what happens to y--" His voice breaks on the last sound. He can't say it.

"_Maybe_ because you left." It sounds almost matter of fact, and the way Sasha looks at Daniel, she could believe it. "There was something between us - some connection. And it was stretched far, for so long, because we were seperated. Maybe it eroded after time, and she was the straw that broke it. The last push."

"Are you guys going to start telling me something anything time soon?" asks Ming. "Or maybe you should go have lunch somewhere together. Take a romantic walk.. whatever works for you." She's not sure if she's joking in annoyance or is serious.

"My heart bled quietly every day we were apart, but y--" Again he can't finish the thought: _But you were killing me by inches, anyway._ "Perhaps I should thank her, then, and let it be done." He shakes he head, laughs mirthlessly. "But you can't leave it be, of course. Truth be told, I don't know if I have it in me, either." He turns to Ming. "You know as much as we do. Sasha and I are--" _Everything._ "--childhood friends grown apart. What's left is just... history."

"You need to speak up, _Daniel_, if you want to be heard. You have something to say, please. I'm listening." She merely looks at Ming from the corner of her eye. "He and I hav-had similar powers. How do we get them back?"

"She doesn't know," Daniel spits. "The _proper_ question is probably why did we have them in the first place?"

"That would be nice to know. When did these powers first manifest," says Ming. "They clearly needed the link to function. If you were both related to shadow.. hm. I wonder what the link can share. It might be useful to my research. Super powers may be something that can be formed on a link. Will you open your minds to me?"

Sasha looks carefully back at Ming, and doesn't respond immediately. Infact she almost doesn't respond at all. After taking a hard look at Daniel, she nods once. "All right."

Daniel stares at Ming, shocked by the absurdity of her words. _She doesn't understand--this isn't just some minor 'problem' that needs analysis. Of course not, why should she? That's why you wanted to open to her in the first place, isn't it? So she'd understand?_ He smooths his features. "As you wish," he answers. _Or I do, I guess._

"Good," says Ming. She opens the link with more care than last time, of course. But this is important. (( If your powers operated along a link and were similar, perhaps with a link they can be restored. Assuming of course the important part of the link is not the third party. ))

"This..." Sasha starts out loud, then tries again. (( This is nothing I've ever felt before. )) Since last night, most likely. A look at Daniel. (( I don't think we've ever been aware of one another. ))

Thoughts whirl inside Daniel's head. ((It probably is this 'third party',)) he allows, avoiding answering Sasha. He gaze focuses on the ground, fighting to keep everything else to himself.

(( Perhaps, but perhaps not. There may be something you can learn this way. And it's better than giving up. )) Ming lets out a soft sigh and considers carefully. (( It might be possible for others to share something of their abilities with you this way, but I doubt they could actually have granted you the powers you have. ))

Daniel remains silent, and perhaps sullenly so. Nevertheless, he keeps himself still as possible, trying not to think, to wonder how-- _No._ A trace of the firm denial might have echoed on the link, but nothing more.

Ming sighs to herself. Well, this is great. (( You guys DO want to get your powers back, right? )) She's getting a little annoyed at the complete quiet. (( You probably should consider trying to make some kind of effort. ))

Sasha begins to pace, radiating quiet frustration. This isn't like her, wasn't like her. But at the moment, the situation is dire. (( What are we supposed to do? Kiss and make up? Put two and two together. The connection is broken. Something's left us, is out there. We have no powers. ))

(( What did you do to use your powers. Tell me everything about how they worked. Everything you can remember, no matter how small. )) Ming wants to approach this as scientifically as possible.

Daniel looks to Sasha, a mild query on his face. (( How we did it? We called, the shadows came. How do _your_ powers work? By force of will. We're no different. ))

Sasha merely shakes her head. (( It wasn't a muscle or a maneuver, it was just there. I thought, I wanted it there, it was. ))

(( Lift a hand, lift a person. Step into a shadow, imagine yourself invisible and then you are. )) Daniel shrugs.

(( And nothing about it ever changed? Couldn't you make your power grow stronger? What we're trying to find is a way to unlock what lies inside you. )) Ming sighs softly. (( Can you remember the last time your powers worked? ))

(( Last night, before the connection. I slipped up onto a rooftop. )) Sasha leans against the dresser, staring out the window into the morning sunlight, a shadow cast over her from the blinds. (( Whenever something new happened, it was more a matter of just realizing something, then practicing it. Like an idea of how to change. ))

(( Stronger? More shadow would respond as we grew older. And we'd think of new things it could do--blind someone, bind someone. The last thing I was doing with my power was stalking an imaginary shadow beast, and then spearing it. Almost speared you, remember? )) Daniel looks at the enshadowed Sasha. _When has she been anything else? When have I?_

Ming frowns and breaks the link. "I don't think this is going to be productive. I'm not entirely sure who I can even contact about this. Considering our various limitations.. we can't just go out and call experts randomly."

"What are we supposed to do in the mean time." Uncomfortable, almost lost. Sasha continues to stare out the window.

"Who died?" Daniel asks, quietly. _Even now I want to go over to her. And even now I think if I do I might end up with a dagger in the ribs._ "Who was the man who was shot? I don't know how old I was, but I must have been four or five or something. Maybe we could check the papers. How many murders take place with young kids as witnesses?" _I left when the latter began to seem more likely._

Ming frowns in thought, "Well, if you want to stay here, I suppose I can arrange it," offers Ming. She's kind, but this is kind of worrying to her. She doesn't want her sister in danger. "As for the rest. I don't know. I don't understand enough of what is happening."

"What makes you think there's records," Asks Sasha, simply Looking at Daniel. "They looked... I don't know. I want to say the mob. He was driven out into the countryside where-ever we were and shot. They likely did something with the body."

Daniel shakes his head. "I have an apartment," he tells Ming. "Sasha is welcome to come along, or we can find a hotel room." A ghost of a smile curls his lips. "Wouldn't want your sister thinking I'm cheating on you in your own place." _Or winding up accidentally dead._ He looks at Sasha. _And how will you take that, I wonder? 'Cheating' on Ming, indeed. Will you see it for the flippery it is?_ "We probably told someone, don't you think? If kids were there, there were probably adults. I don't know. My phantom friend has never been... talkative."

"This is very strange," says Ming. She sighs and shrugs, though. "I'm afraid I have to study just to have a hope of helping you. Maybe it's just a matter of time."

It seems as though a shroud of weight has fallen over Sasha, and she looks suddenly tired. Too tired. Rather than opening her mouth, she simply looks at Daniel, then turns to Ming. "Where's your bathroom?" The exhaustion plain.

"Outside the room, take the left down the hall, first door on your left," says Ming. "Feel free to use whatever you need. You are as safe here as I can make you, which hopefully is enough."

She pulls open the door and walks out. Though stopping in front of it, Sasha turns back. "Thanks." It sounds almost obligatory, cast off, but if nothing else, Daniel knows it didn't come easy. She disappears into the bathroom.

Daniel locks his knees and refuses to go to her. He watches stonily silent as she moves by him. He smells leather and sweat and even more the reality of her presence is driven home. His heart lurches and his teeth clench. _She was supposed to come in fury. This isn't fair. Now what am I supposed to do?_
