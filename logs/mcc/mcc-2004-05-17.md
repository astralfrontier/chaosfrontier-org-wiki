Several weeks have passed since Darkglow and Nightstar went on their trip through memory lane. Things have settled down. Clarity has been working on Foxbat, and just two days ago he was deposited at a psythiatric hospital for evaluation and observation. Ming has stayed on call, going from work to the hospital since. DarkGlow has been exercising his powers, feeling them fit like an old glove. NightStar did move in next door, and since then has been Shawntae's escort between the base and his home; she doesn't seem to mind being a bodyguard and baby sitter, considering the paychecks signed by Lydon aren't that bad.

The team's duties have been light of late. Either things have died down, crime is on the decent, the various criminals have dropped their suits and all is going well, or more likely it's just the lull before the storm. The first rumblings come from a call from Shawntae across the wire. "Hey guys. Lydon wants you at the base ASAP."

DarkGlow drops the radio back into a pocket and briefly considers calling in sick. _Who am I kidding? Boredem is making me itchy..._ With a bit of a sigh, he drags his costume out of the closet and makes his way to the gathering.

Ming had an emegency with her sister - she broke her nose playing basket ball with some friends. Guy couldn't be reached, and considering last time he left his radio in the fridge by accident, no one is really surprised. Lydon's perched on the edge of the table in the 'Briefing' room, an answering machine by his side.

"So... is the meeting cancelled due to lack of interest?" DarkGlow asks sardonically.

Thomas arrived quietly, without show, informed of the disposition of his teammates. Now he waits patiently to hear what's in store.

DarkGlow doesn't really wait for an answer. Mentally he's still patting himself down and making certain he arrived all in one piece. _Geez, I still feel like I'm fourteen again going through shadow. The entire thing feels more natural, but it still tastes strange--where 'feel' and 'taste' are completely arbitrary because I really have no idea what I'm talking about. Hey, at least Sasha understands me when I talk about this--when she actually wants to talk, that is. Of course I still think that Lydon could hand me my butt, even without Tengu, so let's not push things, hey?_ He looks around at the others in the growing quiet of the room. "Err... I'm sorry? I didn't mean it? I'm really ready to go--honest."

Lydon looks less pleased than normal. "They can be let on after you two've left." Tapping the answering machine, it beeps. "One read message." "Lydon? Lydon, this is Phil." The man sounds nervous, near panic. "Something's wrong. I don't know if I'm in danger, or if just my job is but, I was going through files I shouldn't have; I stumbled onto them. And... I don't know. Call me back. Please. My cell phone. I'm taking a bus out of here in the morning."

"And this 'Phil' is...?" DarkGlow asks.

"A technician at FoxMecha Tech in Denver." Lydon crosses his ankles, "Phil and I were at grad school together; we kind've had a healthy competition with our grades and our research and experiments. He got a job in Denver while I came out of college and started working for my father. We trade inside information about what eachother's working on." His tone sounds dire, despite the tale telling.

"That message was left last night. I didn't get to it until this morning because I was at a dinner meeting and came home late, then crashed. When I called Phil's cell, nothing. I called for two hours. I called the bus station; he had bought a ticket, but it was never punched, meaning he never got on the bus. There's no answer at his place either, and I don't remember his girlfriend's number."

DarkGlow shrugs. "Shawntae should be able to get that easily enough. Guess if he was taking a bus, he doesn't fly a suit then. And I also guess we're heading to Denver?"

"You guessed right. Even if Phil's just fine, there's not much that spooks him. I'd like you two to comb the building, see if there's anything wrong. Ming and Guy can join you when they can hop on a plane next." The scientist holds up a pair of plane tickets. "Can you two leave this afternoon?"

The Ghost shrugs a bit. **I have no objection. Perhaps he was 'picked up'? If so, understanding who would have a motive would be useful.**

DarkGlow throws a sly look at Lydon as he accepts his ticket. "Haven't build a sidecar for Tengu yet? You know you're ruining my image of powersuiters, right?"

The scientist smirks. "You want to ride in a side car into the cold mountains of Denver going eighty miles an hour?"

DarkGlow says, "I'm sure you'd design in such essentials as a heater, TV, VCR, microwave oven... Then again, I don't think you'd provide stewardesses. Never mind."

Reaching out, Lydon pats DarkGlow on the shoulder. "The airline has enough stewardesses, promise. And they supply peanuts."

DarkGlow thows the briefest of glances at Lydon's hand. _Not hurting anything, should probably just ignore it. Probably rude or something to move away or knock it off me._ "Well, then," he replies aloud, "the plane it is then."

Sliding off the table, Lydon turns. "And by the way. Don't go flashing your powers around. The media treats you guys as an extension of me. And if you go guns' blazing into a technology company that challenges mine professionally, you'll either look like saboteurs, spies, or bullies. I can trust you to use discretion."

**Simple enough,** replies the Ghost, agreeably.

DarkGlow looks sidelong at GhostKnight. "I can promise no flashbombs, anyway. You sure the airline will let us go in costume?"

**Your face is unknown and mine is ... alterable,** suggests the vigilante. **We should have no difficulty.**

GK departs the base; Thomas Temple is the one making a phone call. Dialing his sweetheart's number at home, he leaves a brief message - "I'll be out of town for awhile, on business" - and a phone number through which he can be contacted. That done, he turns his attention to his armor. It won't go through customs as is, but its construction is merely kevlar, ceramic, and support structures... A few minutes later, the young man eyes his new, kevlar-padded, plate-reinforced suitcase with pride, smiling at his own cleverness.

A phone call goes to Lane Ortabon. The ghostly voice projects just as well over the phone. It sounds as though Lane fell out of his chair on the other end. "Hi... hadn't expected you to call." Lane relays a little information. Phil Milchowski was working on robotic mechanisms for prostetics, part of the procedure using nanotechnology. Phil and Lane occasionally sent eachother findings because one of Milchowski's pet projects was creating robotics, and giving Lane a few tips with constructing a better CAT. Lane gives a few other names, notably Abe Brick, Raheem Mahed and Clarice Lowsh, and a few other names to help the Knight move through the organization's ladders a little easier.

The trip through the airport is fine. While the baggage claim guards do give a particular eyeing to Thomas's suitcase, running it through the machine twice, all goes well. The flight had no problems, except for a minor catch problem with the landing gear, but fortunately GK fixed that unnoticed before it became an issue, to no one's notice. The Denver airport is just the same.

Like Michigan, Denver is definitely cooler. Right off the plane, the pair set off to Phil's house, and find no sign of him. Two messages are on his answering machine. One is a request from someone to go bowling tomorrow afternoon. The second, from Dedra. "Phil? What was that all about on the phone? Pick up. Answer your cell phone. Something. You've creeped me out."

The Ghost - in his elegant human guise - hums at this news. "We should investigate this building first," he suggests, "then see about this 'Dedra'. Perhaps she knows something Lydon does not."

"Not from that message, she doesn't," DarkGlow observes. "But her number's probably on his speed dial so talking to her should be easy. Redialing the last number he called might also be fun. Meantime, yeah, I guess poke around."

The apartment is clean, but not too clean. Drawers have been opened and pawed through, but the Knight finds only one set of prints on everything, and they aren't new and on every since space, just the dresser, a few clothes in the closet. The fact the prints are on various other places, like the toilet handle, is easily suspectable that they belong to Phil.

DarkGlow glances around for something else to search but sees nothing. "So... any safes hidden in walls or whatnot?" he asks GhostKnight.

Prowling around in walls and shelves, the Knight does turn up a box. Inside are a ring, a picture in a frame, and some baseball cards.

DarkGlow looks over the baseball cards. "Never saw the attraction myself," he remarks. "Then again maybe I'm just jealous 'cause I never had 'em growing up. Wonder what the odds are the ring isn't/wasn't for Dedra?"

The picture is of a heavy set man with his arm around an graying woman. However, as the Knight touches it, he senses ink on the back of the picture. Hastily written, mostly dry. It spells out: Office Chair.

DarkGlow automatically wraps his hand in shadow for a bit of cutting work, but halts and turns to GhostKnight. "Umm... you've probably got a more delicate touch."

DarkGlow can't help but be impressed when GhostKnight barely gives the suspect chair a glance before shaking his head. DarkGlow shrugs and offers, "Well, he might actually mean the chair in his office, I suppose. Nothing more to see here, I don't think."

"Very well," replies his partner. "Let's get going. We were never here," he adds, spreading out a hand, and watching a delicate sphere of hair, skin and other things accreting over his palm in the air.

DarkGlow rolls his eyes. "Yes, I feel the memory slipping aw-- Err... where are we?"

"Oh, wait. Gimme a sec." DarkGlow heads over to the phone, and hits redial. He mentally fumbles for a joke while it rings, but comes up blank. _So what are you going to say, genius? Maybe just do the heavy breathing bit?_

It takes two rings before it's picked up, the sound of a woman's anxious voice. "Phil? Phil, you there?"

DarkGlow's eye widen for a second, then feels like slapping his forehead. _Caller ID, you twit. Great, now what? Uh, well, the truth is probably easiest..._ "Uh, no, sorry. Actually, we're investigating Phil on behalf of a colleague of his. He left a message to arrange a meeting but he never showed up."

"Really?" Dedra shuffles the phone on the other end. "The cops are on it that fast? Have you found anything? Hold on, going through a-" for several seconds there's nothing. "Did you say anything? I didn't hear for the tunne.'

Thomas listens to the conversation quietly, then selects a pen at random for the desk. He begins writing rapidly in the air, the ink hanging there through the application of his power. It reads: "Arrange meeting for deposition tomorrow."

DarkGlow considers briefly--_Yeah, that'd be easier than breaking into her place for a little late-night chat, or hoping Clarity arrives to take a wander through her brain._\--then nods at GhostKnight. "No, I didn't. I was actually hoping we could meet to go over anything you might know. Would tomorrow be all right?"

"Tomorrow? Fine, just fine. Um. There's a deli on the corner of Carnation and Houston, it's just a few blocks from where I work. How does tomorrow at Noon?"

"That's fine," replies DarkGlow. _Okay, now end it--politely._ "Thank you for your cooperation." _Eh, not bad._

"Thank you. Look hard, goodbye." Dedra hangs up.

Thomas gives a silent thumbs-up, and waves the ink back into its pen before returning the instrument to its proper place. "Right. 'Office Chair' may also be a code-word or password of some kind," he suggests. "Let's see what he was working on?"

"Hmm. Well, he called Dedra last--from here, anyway. I doubt he said anything more than 'I'm going on a business trip.', but you never know," remarks DarkGlow. "And if 'Office Chair' isn't the password, Shawntae could probably help out with a little remote cracking."

Thomas nods. "Alright. Also, we might do well to ask Lydon to arrange for unimpeachable credentials - if we're posing as investigators, we'll want the paperwork behind it to be solid."

DarkGlow glances down at his costume. "Do people think superheroes lie?" he asks, only partially rhetorically.

Booting up, the computer seems fine. But none of the icons lead to programs that look unfamiliar, and a password is required for opening up the start menu. Office Chair does not work. However, suspicious, GK begins feeding in the names of the players on the baseball cards. After several moments, Mantle cracks open the start menu. A file is linked to the start menu, filled with several text files and a few documents in a particular program.

The information is the technical evidence of what Lane was talking about. Prosthetic parts, from arms to eyes to internal organs. The limbs merely need a little more work, asetheticly, in the final stages. This uses minor nanotech, primarily in connection with the brain for control. The eyes are in general stages of functioning, while the internal organs are in the developmental stages, but look promising.

DarkGlow stares blankly as screens of text and diagrams flash by under GhostKnight's control. "So... does it say which evil corporation was planning on using his tech to build an army to take over the world?"

"No indication of any such thing," murmurs the vigilante, absorbing data hungrily. "I wonder though... did this threaten anyone? And if so, why now as opposed to some other time?"

Combing through the rest of the computer doesn't prove much. A search for files of the same program used to blueprint the mechanical parts draws up simple designs for robots, one labelled 'Battle Bots Homegame entry'.

DarkGlow shrugs impatiently. "Who knows? Maybe he was on to something big. Maybe someone suddenly thought of alternate uses for his tech. Or maybe he just has gambling and/or drug debts that are way overdue and just got called in."

Browsing for Battle Bots Homegame merely pulls up a log of an email conversation between Phil and Miles Pint, conversing about hosting their own competition of bots for fun and profit, the two mentioning aiding a local highschool.

Phil's email proves only partially fruitful. Spam, idle emails to friends, however a few catch the Knight's eye. They are conversations between Phil and a man who signs his name as Hazmat. It's discussion over the internal organs research, Hazmat mentioning nanotechnology and the reactions with internal processes. Reformation, various chemical enhancements and neural-nerve mimic responses. The conversations are brief, simple question and answer and notes, before Hazmat mentions two days ago that the project will be close enough to begin live field testing.

Searching the deleted e-mail, Phil's receipt for a Greyhound ticket is found. It appears he purchased the ticket at one in the morning. Looking through his browser, nothing of note comes up just yet.

Thomas sits back from the computer, digesting what he's read, then rises, glancing at DarkGlow periodically, then out into space. "I don't think he ran for it," he concludes. "He was trying to do that anyway. If he wanted to make a break, he'd have gotten on the bus."

DarkGlow nods. "About what we figured. Where to?"

Thomas shakes his head. "To know where HE went, we have to know who would have had an interest in intercepting him. I'm going to review a few more emails, to find out who this 'Hazmat' is. Then I'd say let's pay a visit to his workplace."

"Sure." DarkGlow looks about aimlessly for a moment. "Well, I think I'll go through the Yellow Pages for some takeout. Anything you care for?"

Thomas shakes his head. "I'd care for some answers," he replies wryly. "Unfortunately there is no 30-minute delivery guarantee for those."

"I dunno. Do psychic hotlines advertise in the Yellow Pages?"

The hunt is long, but eventually Phil refers to Hazmat as Chance. Checking all of his bases, GK calls Lane. Lane returns his call, informing him Chance Pultz works for FoxMecha Tech, but the particular project he's working on is a security measure.
