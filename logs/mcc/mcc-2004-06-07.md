# Millennium City Chronicles 2004-06-07

Ming settles into her first class seat with a nervous frown. She again considers calling to check on her sister. It's been nearly five minutes since she called! She looks at a passing flight attendant and gets a long-suffering look in return. She's been bugging them the entire flight. Three phone calls so far. Even her sister is getting a bit annoyed.

Leave it to chance to have her sister get injured just on the brink of a trip. At least Jiaojuan wasn't hurt seriously. At least she's being well taken care of while Ming is away. That doesn't really make Ming any happier about it, but staying would only have made her sister feel worse, and so here she is, on her way to Denver. She tilts back her seat and realizes that flying is so much better in first class.

_How come Ming gets to ride in first class?_ Guy whiles away the time in coach. The detective's hat is pulled low over his eyes, mostly to block out the abysmal sight before him. In-flight meals. Bleah. _I swear... they're trying to poison me._ Of course, sitting directly behind Guy is the hyperactive little boy somewhere between the ages of 6 and 10. The seatback kicking has been going on for oh, twenty minutes or so now. _Still it's better than the questions..._ "Hey kid... doncha have someone else to bug?" "No." "Didn't think so." Guy slumps back in his seat. _I wonder what they REALLY have in those oxygen masks..._

DarkGlow standing just inside the airport's entrance, DarkGlow glances around at the people milling about, even at this time. Dressed again in his khaki pants and a cream dress shirt, he thinks about how well he blends in with the rest of the public. Face expressionless and thoughts just a touch sour, he tugs his linen and cotton peaked cap lower on his head; it's not the ball cap he's used to, but is slightly more stylish. It's actually still not the hat he really wants, but the idea of going out and actually _shopping_ for hats sends shivers through him. _Let's not change that much, shall we?_

His eyes run again over the crowd, this time looking for whatever face GhostKnight has mutated his into. He sees nothing and shrugs to himself. _He probably won't be late. Let's just get going._ Following the somewhat helpful posted signs, he heads off to where Ming is supposed to appear.

The man in the black trenchcoat, wearing boots of the same color, faded jeans and a simple white shirt, isn't anything special. He's not supposed to be. The face is the European aristocrat of times past; the Ghost Knight smiles, exposing clean white teeth. He hails DarkGlow with a wave, then turns, noting the arrival of people at the gate. The press of humanity streams past slowly, and he again salutes a pair of people stepping off. "I'll get your luggage," he offers to Ming and Guy. "Walk with us and I'll fill you both in." Leading the way to the carousel, he explains in quiet and clipped tones the evidence (and lack of it) that the shadow-master and he have uncovered. "Mr. Dark has arranged for a meeting with the significant other today."

The baggage seems quite light, and the presentable Ghost seems ready and willing to handle it all himself. He leads the way toward the doors to the front of the terminal. "I rented us a car," he adds over his shoulder. "And there's food waiting."

Food is had, and after Ming and Guy have been settled into a motel, noon is just an hour away. The deli in question is Ankar's Sandwich Engineering, a quaint little shop. After milling around outside, until a quarter til noon, everyone shuffles inside, ordering soda to not be rude. A woman with nervous, shifting eyes and dirty blonde hair pushes inside, and is hailed over to the team's table.

Much as he might want to remain silent and seated, DarkGlow _did_ initially call her. _She'll know my voice, so I guess I'd better use it._ Standing, he offers a hand to the new arrival. He even looks her square in the eye, knowing that she'll see nothing through his sunglasses. "Ah, hello and good afternoon. I'm glad you could make it." With an expansive wave, he introduces the others at the table, concluding, "Please, have a seat."

"Soo..." Guy puts down the menu he'd been reviewing for the last, fifteen minutes or so. "I think I'll have the Triple-Decker... we're gonna at LEAST stay for lunch here right? I mean... airline food an' all..." Guy's stomach growls, and he looks to the nervous woman, "I'm Guy. So, uh, what's going on anyway? This is a safe place yeah?"

Dedra smiles weakly at DarkGlow. "Hi. Um..." She checks her watch. "I won't have a chance to get a bite for another six horus. Hold on." She walks up to the counter and orders a pita melt before coming back. "This is safe, sure. I don't think I was followed, or... I hope not." A look over her shoulder a second, before back to the others. Leaning forward to whisper quietly, "Have you found anything out?"

DarkGlow turns a slighly frozen smile on GhostKnight. _This is about where I'm usually trying not to slice them too deeply. Now what..?_ His eyes slide back to the woman. "Ah... I'm afraid not. We're just starting to look, really. Trying to trace his last steps and the like."

"But you can help us with that." Guy sits up straight, and taps his fingers on the table. "Since... if I'm not mistaken, you know the guy pretty decently, I was thinking, maybe you can tell us more about what he does for his day-to-day kinda thing? Where are his hangouts, what are his habits, that sort of thing..."

Dedra's expression sags a little. "Oh. All right. Um, he works at FoxMecha constantly - it's a chore sometimes to drag him out of the office. He bowls on thursday nights with some friends and co-workers. Every saturday he's at a garage helping some high school kids..." She frowns. "Uh. He's a smoker. And he bites his nails, and he doesn't do the dishes at all."

Guy nods. "Alright. What garage, where does he bowl? Had he been acting funny or otherwise unusual before he left?" Guy stops the questioning as his order's ready. He's back in a flash with a sandwich that looks almost sinful. "Any odd little changes at all? Like, a change in brand of smokes, or uh, something like that? Or y'know, something huge like acting paranoid and saying 'they're gonna get me'. That's good too."

Dedra just stares at Guy for a few seconds, before she starts guessing and guaging out addresses and any minute change of personality down to his new water filter he was going on about. She does mention he had a falling out with a man named 'Chance' a few days ago. Something about work and a few games of Ultima Strike or something. As to the last bit: "He left a message on my cell-phone to nights ago. He sounded scared, said that he found something that seemed suspicious at work. Files and China or... I don't know. I listened to it a few times and couldn't take much from it. He said he was getting on a bus, but he wasn't there at the station when I showed up. His car was still in the condo's driveway."

"Do you still have the message?" asks the Ghost, in his more pleasant voice.

"Yes." She paws through the big purse on her hip and eventually comes up with a cell-phone. Pushing a thousand buttons to get the voicemail, she clicks, before handing it over to the Ghost Knight. The casheer announces her number, and she's off to get the order. GK can hear the message. "Dedra where are you? I called twelve times. Listen, I need to go. I found some files at work, I was digging into someone else's project and I found some things. Some of it's chinese, I can't read it, other's ... I don't know. It doesn't look right, I-I'm taking a bus in the morning out of town. I think someone knows because my computer locked up when I tried to get out. I'll call you later. Bye."

"Mmm. Hmm." Guy muses over this. "Well you know, and this is just a guess, but maybe he suspected his phone was being tapped... said he was gonna take a bus and did something else instead? Did he access his bank account, or have much cash on hand, usually?"

Thanking Dedra for her time, the team files its way out and back to the rental car. Thomas has been quietly in thought, and finally asks Ming to reach out to Shawntae for him. With seconds of flashing thoughts, Tom (and the team) learn more about the phone records, especially about a coworker of Phil's named Abe Brick. "What I suggest," concludes GK, "is that DarkGlow make his way inside, and find this Brick. I'll talk to Lane Ortabon of MC's FoxMecha branch and see if I can get a login and password for the corporate network. If DarkGlow will remain en rapport with Ming, she can supply those and he can see about digging for this 'Chinese file' - Shawntae can stay en rapport as well and assist. I will be waiting outside to provide backup."

The vigilante continues, his soft voice level and focused. "Guy, I need you to start looking into Phil's computer. He was working in robotics; find his suppliers. Read between the lines, find if there's a connection between his work and whatever it was he read that spooked him. I don't know if he was given to randomly nosing into other peoples' files or if he was investigating something connected to his own projects."

"Heh. Not a problem." Guy nods, "I'll see what I can dig up for ya. Do we have his computer, or is it someplace else? I'm kinda worried about messing around though. He said it locked up or something, didn't he?"

"His personal computer is at home," explains GK. "Start there. DarkGlow will hopefully be able to get access to his work computer from inside."

"Sounds like a plan then," replies Guy. "We'll all stay in touch, I take it?"

DarkGlow narrowly avoids automatically glaring at GhostKnight for suggesting that he link minds with the others through Ming, uncomfortably aware that Ming was likely monitoring his reaction. _You offered to let her pick through your brain once. Even if she didn't see what you'd wanted to show her, you can't serious mean to pitch a fit over a simple link now, can you?_ "Yeah," he tells Guy with a bit of a sigh. "We'll all stay in touch."

Ming just listens closely, staying oddly quiet. That little mind touch with DarkGlow was far from ideal. Well, this time should work out far better. At least she hopes so. "So I guess for now I'm just a telephone, huh?" says Ming.

Thomas shakes his head, smiling. "No. You are the heart and soul of the team," he replies, simply.

Guy grins, "So let's be on our way then..." He turns to walk off, and begins humming the tune to Heart and Soul.

DarkGlow looks at GhostKnight oddly. _What the hell does that mean?_ He transfers the look to Ming before realizing she's actually looking at him.

Ming looks to DarkGlow and shrugs. She is kinda curious herself, really. She figures it was just a bit of flattery.

Seeing the momentary flashes of emotion on two faces, Tom smiles again. "You don't believe me?" he asks. "Think on this then. I hide my true nature from all of you. DarkGlow has held onto his secrets for a long time. Guy Neville has his own style, and while he is friendly, he does not.. connect. Making personal connections is anathema to a detective. But Ming Tiaoning.. who here has not opened up to her in some fashion?" And with this said, he looks from face to face. "Who hasn't given her a part of his own self, one way or the other?"

Ming hmmss and considers DarkGlow and then Tom. "I suppose that is true. I'm just too annoying to keep details away from for long, huh?"

DarkGlow flushes awkwardly, the reaction plain on his pale face. He turns away, clearing his throat in embarrassment. _Circumspect, you twit. You aren't always invisible, you know._

"Yeahh... plus you have a ni... er. That is, GK makes a good point Ming. We're certainly glad to have you around." Guy chuckles, then considers, "If you guys need help, let me know. I can try and get there between ticks of the clock... but as I understand, that's a bit risky no?"

Thomas nods. "Best if nobody notices us, period," he suggests.

Guy says, "I can be real subtle then... about as subtle as a... hmm... uhm, something very subtle."

Ming looks at Guy for a moment. She has a ni... nice? A nice what? She just smiles knowingly at Guy and lets him wonder just how much she can detect from his verbal stumbling.

Arriving at the FoxMecha building itself, the Ghost Knight is at least surprised. Doing a routine check of the building via his altered perceptions, three floors are found to be barred from his intrusion. Where some rooms are completely blank in other parts due to the amount of people, the floors themselves are blocked by some solid aura. The only chink in the armor are the elevator shafts, which pass right by the blockaids.

DarkGlow frowns invisibly as GhostKnight reports the surprising news. ((Guess I'll go in and see how the Mark I eyeball works, then,)) he tells the others. He locates someplace that seems quiet and remote on one of the shielded floor, and slips through shadow there.

DarkGlow scowls at the still-strange feeling of stepping out of shadow, but he does step out--intact, and apparently where he wants to be. ((Looks like I made it--don't everyone cheer at once. Onto the guy's office.)) Mentally locating it, he steps through shadow again.

DarkGlow finds Phil's office, with the lights and computers off. Down the hall is a lab containing three people, with metalic limbs in various forms of repair scattered about the room. A computer microscope mechanism is also being used, a man sitting in front of it fiddling a tiny computerised chip. Another, a woman, is watching a tank with mice inside of it. A third is looking through a computer screen while manipulating the tiny pieces of what looks like an eye.

(( If you need a diversion or outside resources, I stand ready to assist you, )) transmits the Ghost's coldly resonant pseudo-voice.

Invisibly, DarkGlow looks around the scene. (( I've apparently stepped into a sci-fi_horror flick. Ming, can you do A_V as well, or do I have to play the movie narrator? ))

Ming laughs softly to herself, letting the link pass along whatever it is that DarkGlow and the others wish to send. (( I can send just about anything you want, I think. Well, any thought. )) No matter how embarassing, she is tempted to add.

DarkGlow is about to snap irritably at her--something like _Yeah, and exactly which switch do I flip to the 'send' position?_\--when there's something like a mental 'click' and he intuitively knows the answer. A bit of concentration sends what he sees and hears down the same link that his thoughts are flowing. He looks around, doing a slow pan. (( Ah. Don't get dizzy now, people. ))

Once DarkGlow decides he's watched the others doing their mostly incomprehensible tasks, instead of slinking invisibly back up the hallway, he re-locates the shadow in the guy's office he'd used before. (( I'm gonna take a look around Brick's office, )) he tells the others. He steps through, only afterwards realizing he'd left the visual transmission running. _Hope they don't get car sick, or whatever._

Ming shakes her head a bit and smirks. Interesting mindjob she's getting from this little exercise, at least. Thankfully she's learned to distance herself from other minds. She's gotten a lot more comfortable with the entire concept of touching others in this way, still, there's something that occasionally distracts her, sending random thoughts across the link, as if she were straining to hear or see something just out of the range of her senses.

After a brief (if unsettling) phone call with his contact in FoxMecha, Lane Ortabon, the Ghost transmits a username and password over the link to DarkGlow. (( We need to find what Chinese files exist on the system. If circumstances permit, please arrange for it. )) He pauses, then adds a further note. (( When this is over, if you wish, I will show you how I 'see'. If you are interested in further work with the link, it may be useful. ))

Phil's office is the same as Abe's. As DarkGlow turns the light on, and moves to turn on the computer, the doorknob to the office turns. Pushing it open, a man in brand-new professional clothing - oxford and khaki slacks - steps in. He looks out of place, from his big shoulders to the nervous flick of his eyes, to the trimmed beard. Looking around a second or two, the man starts patting one of the office chairs.

Swallowing a choked curse, DarkGlow slinks silently closer to one of the walls. _My, aren't we bloody well out of practice? Not paying attention to the shadows in the hall outside the room--must more rust and you'll squeak when you move._ Eyes narrowing, he watches the other feel up the office chair. (( Whatever could he be doing? )) he asks GhostKnight with a knowing mental smirk. (( Shall I wait for him to finish? ))

(( Give no hint of your presence, )) counsels the vigilante. (( This may be more productive than we'd hoped. ))

DarkGlow wordlessly scratches 'strangulation' off his internal list of possible options. (( Will do. ))

The man moves over to the second chair, and feels around. Kneeling down, swiping a hand along the edge, he finds a loose part where the cushion meets the seat. Pulling upwards, thick fingers poking inside to withdraw a sleeve. Hoisting to his feet, the sleeve is opened to extract the edge of a CD, before it's slid back inside. He then frowns. "Now where am I going to put this thing?"

---

Guy steps confidently into Phil's apartment. He looks around carefully though, fr signs of any disturbances that might have been missed. _Hohum. Let's see... any unusual... ahhh there's the computer._ He heads over to boot it up, (( So... which one of these is the 'any' key? ))

Phil's computer is thick with schematics for robotics. Guy digs through prostetic limbs and false eye blueprints, mounds and mounds of text. He comes across one map of the human brain, with arrows pointed at various lobes. Beneath which are lots of text discussing the nanotech to send information through the nervous system, from the brain, to the nanods linked to the nerves adjorning the prostetic. This particular challenge has so far eluding Phil's research team. Clarice Lowsh, a neurologist, has been working closely with both Phil's team and Chance's, notes Phil.

(( So this guy likes brains... huh, maybe he was doing advanced zombie studies or something. It looks pretty cool though. I mean, if you like wires and things in your brains. )) Guy digs around a bit, "Aha!" (( Paydirt... got a bunch of passwords for you guys... ))

---

Finally deciding to put the CD sleeve inside his shirt, tucking it into the waistline, the big man moves to the door, drawing it open to peer around outside.

(( I'm tailing him, )) DarkGlow informs the others. (( Shame I was never much of a pick-pocket. ))

(( Good work, )) replies GK via the link. (( Guy, standby. ))

The thief slips out of the room, closing the door behind him, and tries to act casual. He fails miserably as he passes to the elevator, and fidgets impatiently while punching the button and waiting.

(( Standing by, )) replies Guy. (( What's up? ))

Eyeing the other with an amused expression, DarkGlow resists tapping on his far shoulder with a bit of shadow. (( Err... just following a fellow who was helpful enough to locate a lost CD for us. ))

(( Can you get it without killing him? )) asks Ming calmly. She frowns to herself. (( Well, without hurting would be ideal, but sometimes one must be practical.. and someone in this little business has likely taken and perhaps even hurt this long lost friend of ours. ))

Finally the elevator comes, and he shuffles on, punching for the lobby. DarkGlow notices that a keycard terminal is set in the wall below the buttons. The elevator goes down. On the seventh floor, two people get on, and the thief tries to act normal. The fact he's sweating a little doesn't help.

(( Where the CD goes may be as valuable to know as what is on it, )) opines GK. Meanwhile, he studies the building with his sense of perception, hoping to track DarkGlow and the thief by inference of their position, interested in whether or not the man will make his way into the sense-obstructing areas.

DarkGlow is sweating a bit more, too, with more than one person to avoid bumping into. His eyes constantly shift between the other riders, and an empty shadow in the lobby is held tightly in his mind should he need to exit quickly.

The two riding the elevator get off on level six. The big man breathes a sigh of relief, and finally the elevator gets to the lobby. He wipes a hand over his forehead, takes a breath, and walks out, making a slow trek straight for the doors.

DarkGlow teleports over to the open shadow rather than traipse across the lobby. (( You got him, GhostKnight? ))

(( I cannot discern living things, as you know, )) replies the vigilante from outside. (( However, I have in sight what I believe to be the quarry. ))

The big man pushes through the doors, and heads straight to a 1995 Chevy truck. Climbing inside, he tosses the CD into the passenger seat, and turns on the engine.

(( DarkGlow, the computers. I'll trail this man, )) suggests the Ghost, already in motion as he thinks this.

(( Good. I hate trying to teleport out of a moving vehicle, )) DarkGlow replies. Once more he steps through shadow to the office and, firmly setting a corner of his mind to monitoring the hallway for moving shadows, proceeds to turn on the computer.

The Chevy pulls out of the parking lot, with GK trailing. It travels several miles before parking in front of a YMCA. Inside the thief goes, going straight for the men's locker room. The CD is placed in a locker, then an accompanying lock is bolted across, before the thief turns and leans his back against the heavy metal wall.

An unnamed, unnoticed man makes his way past the lockers - from the other side. He's dressed casually, someone nobody would look at twice. This lack of interest serves him well, for nobody will see his hand reaching through solid matter to grasp the CD, nor will any camera discern the act which follows. And outside, the Ghost Knight reports his success. (( I have the CD. It was placed in a locker at the YMCA. The locking mechanism has now been jammed - it will take time to undo my work. ))

DarkGlow takes a break from fruitlessly poking around the computer. (( Copy the CD and replace, or just have it vanish? And I'm not really getting anywhere with this computer. Anyone care to help out? ))

Ming considers for a moment. (( Well, let's check his email first, and see just who he's been talking to. I'd also like you to check documents accessed since the disappearance, as well. There should be information about viewing times and modified times. Hopefully we'll find something of use. ))

Ming's instructions focus DarkGlow first on pulling up email, seeing what kind of messages have been passed around. She also has him view files accessed by users since the time Phil Milchowski vanished. She's very interested in anything that has been read or viewed by him, in particular.

The business email has nothing useful. Documents that were accessed since the disappearance - at least, file areas - are empty. As is the recycling bin, which was emptied two nights ago. With Shawntae schooling DG through the methods of hacking, the shadow-manipulator accesses the network.

After accessing the network, DarkGlow begins to search for what Phil had found. But, not knowing the particulars, he does a search. First for Chance's name, then his nickname, finally using more generic terms like 'neurology' and 'nanotech'. It pulls up various files - apparently there are almost a dozen nanotechnology projects happening right now. Using Shawntae's skills he does a more intensive search, and finds something that is hidden behind clearance: 'Marionette.'

(( 'Marionette'. Heh--that's what I feel like with you pulling my strings, )) DarkGlow sends to Shawntae. (( Gonna have to remember how to do some of this stuff. ))

Ming considers for a moment, then fires a suggestion towards Shawntae. (( Do a search for anything with Chinese characters in it. It was mentioned that some of it was in Chinese. ))

The search turns up logfiles consisting of emails and notations, along with some nanotech and neurobiology translated into Chinese - mainly instruction. After quickly looking over some of the emails, Ming begins to translate: Brokering. They're discussing selling the technology to the chinese, there's specific mention of special forces and super-soldier - The computer locks up, while a warning hisses across the screen. (( Christ, )) sends Shawntaee, (( These guys are good. ))
