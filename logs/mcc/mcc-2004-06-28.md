"Good Morning for June 8th, and this is the Six O'Clock news. In international news, it's been almost three month since President Bush declared the war over in Iraq, and the rebuilding effort of bombed buildings has doubled due to the assistance of the Salt Lake Six, who volunteered for the relief effort and troop protection during the month long invasion." The camera goes into an interview mode, along with showing the rebuilding efforts.

"The Super Criminal of the late seventies, Vulcan, is presumed dead after his estate on an island within the South Pacific has been completely destroyed." A picture of charred rock smattered across the ocean. "It is believed volcanic activity caused the island's demise, judging by the measures of sesmic vibrations registered by geologists on neighboring islands. Vulcan was a powerful villain of world renown during the early 80s, and remained active up until six years ago when he officially retired."

"President Bush will be arriving in Millennium City next month to commemorate the city's tenth birthday, along with his father who overseen the construction of the city."

"Yesterday at the Wayne County Metropolitan Airport, authorities attempted to apprehend Nitro, who eluded police by crumbling part of the Air port's roof during his escape. Thirty eight people were injured, but none were killed in the chase. Nitro was detected by scanning technology unique to the Metro airport."

"And now, the weather.

---

"Why do I even bother flipping on the news, I wonder?" Guy shakes his head, and fiddles with the television, making a vain attempt to get something resembling decent reception. "Too bad about Vulcan... wonder who this... Nitro is..."

A knock comes to Guy's door.

"Wonder who that could be. Come in!" Guy sits up straigther. Nothing. After a minute, the detective opens his door to discover a box sitting at his doorstep. Inside the box is a lap top, the same style and make seen twice before. On the top is a note: "For the Team Tengu, Mr. Neville."

"Huh." Guy kicks the tv, and for a moment the television's reception is crystal clear. Then it shuts off. "Useless..." Guy then sighs, "Well... may as well see what's in here..."

(( Hey guys... guess what I've got? It's another laptop. Left on my doorstep. Uh, addressed to the Team and to me specifically. Shall we assemble the avengers? )) Guy sighs, and heads for headquarters.

Everyone meets at the headquarters. Bypassing the password with a snap of the finger, Shawntae sits back and lets the video file boot up. The media player starts, and displays the shadowed individual once more. "Greetings, Team Tengu. I havn't contacted you for some time. I have something that might interest you." He holds up the newspaper, showing the headline "Nitro Nixes Pursuit." "This individual is one of over two dozen recognized criminals, terrorists and other movers and shakers across the globe who've showed up in Millennium City within the last three days. They've come by plane, bus, boat, and some have just been spotted by contacts."

"I want to know what's going on. Something is happening, and I do not like having this many individuals of power in my city. On this computer are files containing information that so far I've gathered for the supers my spies have tracked down. Profiles, lodging locations, recent movements during the last two days. I feel that my network is being strained by this task, and I think this is more for your expertise than mine. If you're on the task, send an email to an address in one of the files."

DarkGlow stares off into a corner, a scowl pulling down his lips. _This again? Weren't we going to be getting around to killing this guy off?_ He shakes his head minutely. _At least Sasha arrived rather more than three days ago. Don't have to worry about her being on the hit list._ His eyebrows pull down in a quick moment of consternation. _Err... so did I, for that matter. Umm._

The Ghost humms with an eerie buzzing sound, then speaks as the last traces of the video conclude. **A 'convention' of people, or an auction, or simply a very large task,** he concludes. **Best that it be disrupted anyway, no matter who asks this of us.**

Clarity frowns thoughtfully, pausing to take a bite of the pizza she has levitating in front of her. She's still trying to work on the whole team unity thing, so she would have to bring pizza and a couple six packs to this 'official team function'. Whatever that means. "So, we're supposed to stop.. something."

**Discovering what that something is would be our first step,** replies GK. **Which brings us to whatever files remain on the machine.** He gestures, silently requesting access to the laptop, where he can begin to memorize the data at his usual prodigious rate.

(( Perhaps. I think it's a Convention of Nerds. I believe you call it a Reign of Supervillains...)) informs Guy, helpfully. (( I can't help but wonder who it is though. ))

Shawntae draws up the various files, letting both Guy and the Ghost Knight speed read. Fifteen super criminals, ranging from the most thuggish to sophisticated, respectable, and even one case of freakish, have been profiled. Six are guesses, or suspicions of certain supers but that could be wrong. Three had no profile, but were worth noting simply for suspicion. Seven have been trailed and tagged for their place of logging, or at least habits and motions.

"Not that I don't like cut-- err, arresting people," says DarkGlow, with an irritated glance at Guy and perhaps a touch louder than strictly necessary, "but isn't this matter more suited for the Champions and/or the police? I can see busting Nitro, sure, but random terrorists? They can't all be super-powered, right?"

GK reviews the computers, then thinks for a moment. **The Gremlin,** he concludes. **Sounds like someone who can easily be 'shaken down' for more information. THAT does not sound like a job for the Champions. Or at least, my methods do not..**

Lydon sits up. "All right. Shawntae, contact the email address with a notice that we're handling this." He clears his throat, standing straighter. In a dire tone, "In other news, I received a call requesting the team earlier today."

Thomas turns his helmeted head. **Oh?**

"Don't any of these people have real names?" mutters Ming. She likes breaking into the bank when she knows the combination, herself. "You assume that these people aren't very aware of their own fools. If they are intelligent villains, they aren't likely to share anything of importance with their less savvy cohorts."

Lydon looks from one member of the team to another. In a somber tone, face written with displeasure, "A Reality TV show." Then he fractures into snickering.

(( I suppose so. )) Guy considers. (( But I think you have to have a supervillain type name to join the club. Kinda the same way most super heroes have their own secret names. )) He speaks up as Lydon does though. "Er... wha... Reality Show?"

"Great, a TV show," mutters Clarity. She sighs and expends most of her attention on the beer and pizza, letting her mind drift away from thoughts of the amusing (and rather insulting) offer.

"Heh. At least that one's easy enough to answer," DarkGlow states. "Just say 'no'. And if you won't, I most certainly will."

Guy considers, "Uh... what exactly did they want US for... I mean... I can't think why anyone would want to see our ugly mugs on the small-screen..." He nods to Clarity, "Well, with a few exceptions."

Lydon shakes his head. "They want to follow the team around and just watch you do your work. Or, they directed me to another show the same company is putting on, where two teams go at similar tasks. Sort've like an investigation competition, I don't know. I said it was unlikely, but I would get back to them."

Ming arches an eyebrow at Guy. Her costume is hardly pretty, with that mask over her face. "In any case, it doesn't matter. I don't want to waste time on something silly like that. I have more than enough things to spend time on."

The CEO sideglances at the Ghost Knight. "When I asked them what made them decide us, they said the Ghost Knight's performance during the Detroit Day competition."

**Then I will settle the matter myself,** offers the vigilante coldly. **You need not trouble yourself further with them.** He returns his attention to the laptop. **As to the troupe of rogues, we need not get a fully-detailed plan from a more weak-willed representative. We merely need enough information to investigate further.**

Guy makes a valiant effort to suppress the laughter. Really he does. It's reduced to a chuckle or ten as he pictures the team competing on a Reality Show though.

In North Detroit, there are still some places that are run down and ugly. One of those is the Radcliff Motel, a sad little seedy thing. In one of the rooms, curled enjoying some pizza, is the Gremlin, who's suited well for his surroundings. A hooked nose matches the chin, along with pointed ears and tufted, sparse brows above a balding head. He's short and gangly, and almost fae, but there is nothing otherworldly or magical about how he scarfs down the slices of cheese pie, enjoying an episode of Jerry Springer. Ah, the good life.

The television is a cheap thing, supported on a thin tray supplied by the motel - not even resting on a countertop or inside a cabinet. No surprise, then, that it is crushed to the ground and demolished with a spray of sparks when a black shape from the ceiling, surmounted by a white and grinning death's-head, crashes down onto it with two booted feet. The Ghost Knight comes down in a half-crouch atop the ruined set, then rises effortlessly to his feet as though nothing were amiss. **Gremlin,** his voice declares. **We're going to talk.**

The Gremlin's eyes grow about as big as the pepperoni slices on Antonio's Pizza. "Auh! Shit." He scuttles up to the head of the bed, crouching at the top, and testing the springs as he looks around the room. With the TV by the door... Why do these things happen to him? He doesn't even know the skull headed punk!

Clarity is waiting outside, staying out of the light, though it is hardly a problem. Anyone stepping by her right now will see nothing at all. She listens intently, waiting for something to happen inside. If there is trouble, it will be far from pretty.

The sparks from the destruction of the electronic device briefly illuminate the cloaked form of DarkGlow standing in a shadowed back corner with his arms crossed before his figure silently settles back into shadow.

Guy is, for his part, attempting to look intimidating. He's even brought a mask this time so that if Gremlin should escape, he can't go blab to everyone who's who and what's what. "So uhh... I suppose we can do this the easy way... or the hard way. I'd say, pick the easy way. It's usually best." Guy considers the pizza... and his stomach growls.

**You are here in town for something,** states the vigilante, darkly, striding two paces closer as his words reverbrate. **You and the others. I want to know what.**

"What do you want?" He croaks after a second, eyes shifting between the three. Though, as the Ghost makes the case, the toadie's face grows pale. With a quick motion, he springs off the bed, feet planting on the wall by DarkGlow's head to kick off in a leap towards the bathroom.

Expecting something like this, but not knowing specifics, the Ghost is only a bit slower than he could be, were he gifted the way his teammates are. A gloved hand makes an off-handed gesture; the bathroom door shuts of its own accord, rapidly.

With the door closed, the Gremlin has little time to react. At least, he has little time, but in actuality the bouncing bootlick crawls through the air, the expression of fright wiped away with surprise several inches before he smacks door head on.

Tendrils of shadow writhe in something akin to frustration as, unneeded, they settle back into the darkness pooling on the floor.

Crumpled at the foot of the door is the Gremlin, shaking the stars out of his eyes. "Oow."

**Most people don't use their feet to talk,** remarks the Ghost, coming up behind the Gremlin and reaching down with a hand to seize him by the neck. **Let's try it again, with your mouth this time.**

"I think biting you would be a bad idea," He grouches, but doesn't struggle this time. Hanging limp in the Knight's grip, "... I plead the fifth? That's the right number in this country, right?"

Guy says, "Well that's if you're on trial. We're just having a little chat see... again, that's the easy and hard way bit. Er..."

**Be useful,** advises GK, lifting the Gremlin up bodily and laying him down hard onto the bed, hand still around the other's throat. **What do you know?**

He doesn't struggle, at least this time. "I know that I'll be mulch if I tell you anything. They'll know I snitched! There'll be a lot who have warrents out! Or enemies!"

The Ghost reaches down into the depths of the cheap bed, extracting bits of metal through his body. His hand emerges, and with it, talons of cheap steel emerge from the fingertips, like the claws of some horrid beast. **They aren't here. I am. Worry about me.**

The Gremlin shrinks away from the claws. Even if he can mind bone and flesh, it still _hurts_. "Can't you let a man be mourned in peace?" He squeals.

**Your mouth is all I need, because all I want are details,** continues GK, lowering the claws. **You don't need your feet, for example, to tell me what I asked. So let's start with them..**

DarkGlow looks on in mild interest. _Feet? I'd have started with a kidney. They have a spare and, if they squeal quickly enough, they'd not even lose a fatal amount of blood. Oh, well. Guess I should learn new techniques and all that._

Clarity, hearing nothing happening, grows a little bored. There is an impatient knock at the door and she waits to be let in. Just for safety, she will be invisible at the door. One can never be too cautious.

The Knight's captive shrieks. "I told you! I told you! They're coming to mourn!" Talking fast, "Vulcan died earlier this week and his funeral is here because he was born here back in the fifties and he had a will to have his remains to be dumped here. Everyone's coming for respect!"

DarkGlow steps from the corner, mouth twitching invisibly. He moves toward the door. "Too late," he intones solemnly. "_She_ has arrived."

"She-who-wha?" The Gremlin angles his head to look at the door.

**Hardly a reason to hold out on me,** suggests the Ghost. Aware of something, he flashes a two-fingered gesture at the door, which opens silently. Returning his awareness to the Gremlin, he continues. **Perhaps sterner methods are called for.** And he withdraws, turning his head to whoever or whatever may be outside, and gesturing at the captive as though making an offering.

Shrinking away from the open door, "I told you! The mourners are wanted! Warrents out for all kinds of people who'd show up! The cops get called and you could run in dozens! All of 'em! There'd be lots of destruction, and mayhem, and _I_'d be blamed!"

DarkGlow steps back from the door and holds a low bow.

Ming enters invisibly, letting herself appear only after she's nearly on top of Gremlin. "So you are the one we are supposed to wring dry," she murmurs softly. Her experssion cannot be seen, but her tone is cold and very amused. "Are you going to make me work. Mister.. what did you say your name was? I do like a challenge."

The Gremlin actually sinks into the bed. Cloth and metal parts like gauze under his weight. All to hide his face from this unseen individual. "What more do you want? I've told you everything I know!"

The laugh that comes from Clarity is unpleasant at best. "You wish to play the fool. Well, I'm not very patient right now. When I am done, I fear my hard touch may leave little left. Do you like to simper and flinch? What is your name!" The last is spoken with a hiss that turns into a growl. She doesn't move, but there is a readiness to her, of something being prepared. Something that the Gremlin will find quite unpleasant.

"Hans Flick! Hans Flick! My name is Hans Flick, Hans freaking Flick!"

"Ahh, that is much better," says Clarity. Her voice changes to that of a kindly grandmother, scolding a particularly dim-witted child. "I've always said young men come around with a little of the stick and the hope of honey," she says. "Since you have been such a good boy, I think I might even let you remember your name when I am done." And with that, Clarity begins the real attack.

Clarity takes her sweet time draining the man dry. She does it without much comment. She looks more like a mother presiding over the punishment of an unruly child. At this point, the Gremlin is little more troubling to her than a child. When she is done, which to the man whose mind is being sucked dry might seem like days, she rises smoothly and considers him, her arms crossing and posture shifting. No longer presiding, it seems a greater judgement is coming.

It takes Hans Flick a few minutes to come out of his stupor, the thorough mental rifling leaving him dazed and disoriented. As soon as he has his wits about him, those beady eyes peer over the indentation he's made over the bed. "Can... I work for you?" There's a particular cunning in his expression, something that might not immediately be expected. "You are very capable! All of you. Surely you need someone to run errands? Take care of annoyances that aren't worth your time? Make you coffee?" There's a pleading in his eyes as well.

In the background, DarkGlow shakes his head. _I think his kidney might have been a kinder option..._

Guy blinks a bit. "Er... uhm... us? Capable? Well... I suppose we are but uh..." (( Clarity? What in blazes is wrong with this guy? ))

Clarity snorts. "You ask me to keep you?" she says softly, her voice holding a dangerous frost. "You think to bandy words with me, you little gnat. I will show you just what I am capable of.." As her anger rises, the Gremlin no longer sees the room as it was. Everyone is still there, but from Clarity an icy mist drifts, reaching out towards him, flowing inevitably around him. At first, just sees. Then the cold hits, cold like a thousand needles.

Thomas raises a gloved hand and shakes his 'head'. **No. It's not time to die yet. We are going to make use of the information you've provided, Gremlin,** he says. **If you fear your fellow rogues would hurt you for this, then you have only one chance to live. You will be studied; your gifts analyzed. They will not dissect, only evaluate. You will be cared for. You will make many powerful people happy - and many children too, if such research yields cures for them. Or, we may set you loose. Or, we may continue here.. Choose now.**

He squeals and beats at his skin to keep it from numbing, until the chill stops, and he stares up at the Ghost Knight and considers. While he loves the thugwork... a vacation, and fame, and ... there are likely pretty scientists out there, right? And they'll eventually be done with him, and he can go back to having fun. "I can be a good lab rat," He says finally, sitting up.

**They are likely to pay handsomely, if you are cooperative,** advises GK. **And now, since the police are likely on their way, we should take you to the proper people.**

"Right, right..." Gremlin takes a look at Clarity, and moves to the far side of the room from her. Closer to the Ghost Knight than anything, but he certainly keeps his distance. "...that'll work, yeah."

For a time, Clarity stares at the Gremlin, considering a worm. Less than a worm. He is the filth for maggots to crawl through, judging from her bearing. "Very well, he will live." She makes it sound like far less a mercy than the Ghost Knight, however. "If you are not obedient, boy, I promise you, I will not let you die for a long time," she says very casually.
