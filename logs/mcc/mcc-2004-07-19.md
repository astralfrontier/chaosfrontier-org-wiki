# Millennium City Chronicles 2004-07-19

The little house with the tiled roof, outside of the downtown in Millennium City, is an unlikely place to find a history lesson. Nevertheless, Ming Tiaoning and Thomas Temple sit in the professor's car across the street from this unprepossessing residence. The student has called his teacher here in some sort of half-hearted attempt to explain himself; lately he's felt an odd psychological pressure, bits and pieces of which have made themselves known in his speech, his habits and even his thoughts. "I want to show you where I came from," was what he said on the phone, and now here he is. "Come on," says Tom, climbing out of the car. "This is the first stop."

Ming isn't entirely sure what to think of Thomas' call. Nor of this meeting or place. She nods to him quietly and follows him out of the car. "So is this where you once lived?" she asks. A logical enough guess, she believes.

"Sort of," the student replies as he makes his way up the walk and fits a key to the door. "Come inside." Without a look behind him he steps through the doorway, leading Ming into a hall. Turning left, another key is fitted to another lock and Tom opens a door in the hallway. Behind it are stairs, and he reaches out to tug the chain that lights up the passage down. "This is my father's house," he explains. "I stay here sometimes, but he keeps things here I want to show you.."

The basement is packed wall-to-wall with books, paintings, and a million other odds and ends from a million corners of global culture. It's a farrago of eccentric gewgaws, a sea of mysteries in the shape of art and literature, worked out of stone, paper, glass, crystal, paint. "My father's collection," explains the young man. "Professor, how long have superheroes been publically active?"

"The first reports of super activity occurred in the 1930s," says Ming. "Of course there is a great deal of debate over the exact time. And even more over whether they were truly the first or merely the first that were revealed." She studies the works of art curiously and then turns her steady gaze back to Thomas.

Thomas nods and smiles a little bit. "And before that, for hundreds of years, history was filled with reports of witches and warlocks. Communities of strange little men or inhumanly beautiful beings with magical powers who hid themselves away. Vampires or shapeshifting animal-like beings." He walks across the room - no trivial feat, given the state of the floor and what's on it - and selects a book, almost at random, from one of the shelves. Carefully the young man thumbs through it, finding a place, then using his power to levitate the book closer to his teacher. "Here.."

The book's text on the left-facing page is in Latin, but on the right is an illustration - showing some artistic quality, but principally of interest for its depth. The scene depicted is of a battle on the sands of some far-off desert. Men in armor clash with turban-wearing swordsmen in the background. The foreground is dominated by a man wearing a sort of scale-mail armor, cupping his hands together, apparently chanting or shouting. Blazing fire encompasses his body, and a bolt of the same is forming a coruscant beam at a concentration of the turbaned troops.

Ming arches an eyebrow and nods her head. "Yes, this is something I have tried to look into, but like so many points of history, I ran into no answers, just supposition. Perhaps I might learn more from others. There may be a super out there already who can answer this question for us. Do you know of one, Thomas?"

"You're looking at an ancestor of mine," replies Tom softly, nodding toward the book. "Who may or may not have been able to do the things depicted there." He smiles, and the book shuts itself on its own, returning slowly to the bookshelf. "You're looking at one of the men who formed the basis for my alter-ego. But he may have done more than just that."

"It would be nice to learn that there is some genetic tie to super powers," admits Ming. "I like things that make sense. But I have been frustrated too many times to let myself get my hopes too high." She allows a small smile and asks, "Do you have other ancestors who also may have had powers?"

"All of them," smiles Tom. "Now before my father gets angry, I can't show you too much here, so we need to leave. But there's other things, and other places, on today's tour, if you are willing."

"I don't know if your father would really be that angry," says Ming. "But I will see what else you have to see." The professor is of course making her usual mental notes. "Perhaps your father might even find my research of some use. He did seem to hint that I was of good.. stock."

Up the stairs, and out into the hall, Tom leads the way again. He carefully locks the door, stopping only by the refrigerator to retrieve a pair of bottled root beers before heading out. Once outside, he nods toward the car. "Feel like doing some driving? I want to tell you a story from a hundred years ago, and why super-powers may or may not be wholly genetic in nature."

Ming smiles, "I can drive. You just have to let me know where I'm supposed to be going." She lets out a little sigh, "You know, it occurred to me that even now my modes of travel are very far from exotic. Can't we get some kinda secret jet? Or rocket packs?"

"Lydon Yamaguchi's got gravity-manipulation science, talk to him," suggests Thomas with a smile. "Or, develop your own telekinetic talents. I might be able to help you." He settles in, giving directions out of town to the west, and twists open a bottle before taking a long, careful drink. "Once upon a time," he says, opening the story, "there were a lot of people who believed in magic. And there were a lot of ways to use it, but even so, very few people were privileged to have it. In general those people were very loved or very feared, usually in that order. Heroes and villains."

"A lot of these stories had something in common, though," he continues. "And that is the involvement of umm, extranormal existence. Ghosts, or spirits, or angels coming down and bestowing power, or djinn made from smokeless fire. This didn't set well with a lot of people, and so the people who dealt in this sort of thing started to become more secretive. They made jokes about it. By the Victorian era, the occult was a game, and you had seances with giggling girls.. But some people took it seriously. They saw a connection. In 1895, for example, the Theosophical Society Adyar was founded in India. It had three objectives: form a universal brotherhood of mankind, to encourage the study of religion, philosophy and science, and finally, to investigate unexplained laws of nature and powers latent in man." Tom sits back in the car seat and drinks from his root beer again. "They spent 40 years working with the science of inheritance. Four decades - and then superhumans become public just as the last interests in spiritualism and occultism seem to dry up."

"A rather strange coincidence," says Ming. "But there were still some who held the torch, so to speak. I have found several indications that the more dark world powers had a great interest in the occult. In particular, the Nazis put a great deal of time and effort into the mystic. Yet with no success we know of."

"Mystic research, and genetic research.. They're two approaches to the same goal: unlock the powers that a limited subset of mankind has exhibited," replies Tom, nodding. "But what a lot of people didn't consider is that maybe you needed both, together. You needed the right people, who'd inherited the right.... the right something." He waves his hands around, vaguely, and nearly splashes root-beer across the dash. "The right gene, or whatever the trigger is. But you also need something else, something almost mystical. Tell me what happened with DarkGlow, for example?"

"As far as I can tell, what happened with DarkGlow was that the source of his powers temporarily removed itself. I consider it something akin to a partial possession," says Ming. "It is as if the source, which was a psyche of some kind, withdraw itself, only to return later in some capacity. A rather confusing mess, to be honest about it."

Thomas nods and smiles. "Just so," he says. "An external psyche, or entity - a ghost or spirit or angel or djinn. Like in the stories, but now we call it something new, like a 'telepathic presence'. And what about you? What do you remember about your powers?"

"I remember little of them. However, I do remember that my psychic presence disrupted DarkGlow's source," says Ming. "If that is true, then perhaps I can come to know how to disrupt any powers. Or to encourage them."

"It's possible," says Tom. "You'll notice that throughout history, the people who manifested actual, extra-normal powers were saints, or mystics, or monsters - either singular beings who didn't really breed heavily, or creatures that were to be destroyed on sight. The need for inheritance means that breeding is a factor in power potential, if this is right. But the need for this extra, this 'spiritual addition', is itself a factor that discourages propagation of whatever the catalyst genes are, if in fact the inheritance factor takes such a form. In short, you need to have a lot of kids, but you can't, because people are scared that you're a flame-wielding weirdo. My ancestors found a way around that."

"They organized. Inbred royal families, like the Merovingian dynasty of France, the so-called 'sorcerer-kings'. Quasi-spiritual religious orders that could escape the scourge of the Inquisition and the mark of heresy associated with the necessary mystical component of powers, by hiding within the shadow of the Church of the time. Carefully controlling inheritance by putting the people you wanted to keep breeding into aristocratic families, or hiding them somewhere nobody would look. Like little houses in the suburbs of the city."

"Like the Tutonic Knights," suggests Ming. "Or any one of countless religious orders in history." She frowns for a moment, which Tom recognizes as the same expression she wears when she's mulling something over and struggling with a conclusion. "This means that there is something mystic in all of us. But what does that even mean? What is this mystic branding? It seemingly has nothing to do with good or evil."

"I'm not sure it's so much 'supernatural' as simply umm, a product of a sort of mental science, the way we have physical science. And I don't mean psychology - more like parapsychology. The physics of telepathy, and so forth." Tom shakes his head. "What it means for starters is that you, and my father, both have a basic tool-set for working with one half of the power equation, if all of this is at all accurate. And I don't think it's really a moral thing either. People use powers in accordance with their own whims and beliefs, and get assigned a label - saint or monster. Genetic potential forms a mold, and mental force is poured into that mold, and you get a power. It's up to you to use it from there."

"Perhaps in time we might understand why we have the powers we do," says Ming. The mentalist sighs and shrugs, "We're ages away from any such knowledge, though, I'm afraid," she admits. "Perhaps your father knows more, though. I still will have to find out what makes a good receptacle for powers."

"I don't think we're ages away," says Tom, quietly. "I think someone already found it. That's why you have - comparatively - so many superhumans alive today. I mean, how many saints or miracle-workers do you know from history? Catholic saints who could levitate or heal. How many of them were alive at one time? How many supers alive today, now, just that we know of?" He pauses a moment. "If that's true, then you actually stand a very good chance of finding out the mechanism. There are places you might go, things you might learn, that could help. I can try and help with some of them."

"Or it could be that they did their jobs well in the past, and the breeding they did with so much care has now cast more or less pure seeds across all of humanity," says Ming. "It all began after the first World War, when the barriers between civilizations began its great disintegration."

Thomas nods slowly. "And if some mystical factor is also required, who's to say what form it has to take?" he asks. "If it's merely a matter of having a close encounter with something unusual - a haunted house, a ghost on a battlefield, something like that - then it will be very easy. But if it's something a little more complicated - say, active telepathic contact that awakens power potential - then there are ways to discover it. And of all people, you are well-suited to investigate the varying forms taken by mental force."

"Or it could require nothing more than intense emotional experiences," says Ming. "Moments of disaster and pain that call out the supernatural that lives in us. It would explain much."

The car pulls up in front of a large house, outside the city entirely. Smoke wafts gently from a chimney, and a tree-lined road stretches out in both directions. A gravel driveway leads to the front of the house itself, and Tom directs his "driver" to take it. "We're here," he says. "This is my Uncle Peter's house."

Ming nods to Thomas, pulling into the driveway. "So is he like you and your father, or did his apple fall farther from the tree?" asks Ming quietly.

"He's about the furthest from my father I can imagine," chuckles Tom, as he gets out of the car and stretches a bit. "Very nice guy, very agreeable. Best uncle ever, as far as I'm concerned." He looks about, glancing up at the windows from time to time. Not so much looking for anything as revealing his face prominently to anybody who might be looking out.

Ming steps out of the car wearing an amused smile. "You don't seem to really like your father very much, Thomas. Then again, he is a very difficult man." She recalls a night when he bothered her just before bed, for one. "I wonder if he's spying on me."

"Don't see why, he spies on pretty much everyone else. And no, I don't like him, for that reason," replies the young man, quietly.

There's no indication from the porch - no light, shapes in the windows - but Tom knows that Uncle Pete is aware of someone's presence. He's lingering just beyond the door. Though, as the pair wander up the walkway, the door slides open, and out steps a man with a salt-and-pepper beard. Looking from Ming to Thomas, he calls out, "Bringing home a girlfriend, Thomas?"

"For you? No," jokes Tom, with a smile. "Uncle Peter, my professor at school and um, teammate. Ming Tiaoning, my uncle, Peter Temple. He helped me train to become who I am."

Ming bows to Peter and smiles, "It is a pleasure to meet you, sir. Anyone who can keep Thomas occupied for very long deserves respect." She studies the man for a moment, comparing his appearance to Thomas'.

"Ah, I'm sorry. Professor." His smile fits well on his face, like it belongs there. "They seem to be making the academics younger and younger." He gives a bow, holding open the door. Saying off hand to Ming in Mandarin, "I trained him, but don't blame me."

Ming laughs softly and nods. She replies in kind, "I have taught him, but cannot accept responsibility." She means it for a compliment. She turns back to English as she steps through the door, "It is very kind of you to welcome us on such short notice."

Closing the door after Thomas, Peter can merely shrug his shoulders. "Distractions are all well and good; I havn't got much to do, with Thomas's aunt off to Thailand for the rest of the month. I've been pounding away at the typewriter otherwise." Stepping out through the prestine, clean room, "Don't mind the mess. So, what brings you, besides pleasant introductions, Tom?"

Briefly, Thomas summarizes his conversation in the car with Ming. "Just a discussion we were having on, well, family history, and why it matters so much," he concludes. "But you're a lot more talkative than my father. Now I know," he adds, holding up two hands in a gesture of peacefulness. "You won't talk about whatever you won't talk about, and I'm not mistaking friendliness for gullibility. But I've always relied on you."

Simply smiling, the older man leads the pair to the kitchen table. He crosses into the kitchen and into the pantry. "Funny you should mention heros and villains." He appears back with a bottle, collecting a tiny cup from the cabinet. "There are stories that date back centuries of men who could sunder trees with a strike, run on clouds, and drink poison and turn it into blood. They were all supposed masters of kung fu, the comings of Buddha that sent upraisings and rebellions, or thought to be the Eight Immortals themselves." Pouring the liquid in a glass, he lifts it up after a moment. "Sake?"

Ming laughs softly but waves a hand in polite refusal. "I will be driving, and I wish to have a clear head." She wants to show a little restraint, for now.

Collecting a second glass, he pours. Ferrying the glasses and bottle over to the table, he sets down. "Now. There are documented characteristics of monks who can stay under water for nearly hours, slow their heart to the point of being announced clinically dead, and set themselves on fire in meditative states, without sign of distress. These are not supers, but merely physical feats achieved through the mental fortitude of rigorous training." Taking a shot of the rice liqour, "Now, these clearly are the religious athletes that fit that mental liquid, perhaps. So how many do you think it takes before the genetic mold? Enough to account for the sorcerers, demons, and kung fu masters alike?"

"So it's a mix of mind, body, and.. something else? Or is the genetic mould merely the beginning, like a seed that may or may not grow, waiting for an appropriate environment to take its ultimate shape?" Ming taps her lip in thought, "If it is a matter of achieving the potential inside, the increase in numbers makes sense."

"It could be just a matter of statistics. Some have the mental aspect, others the genetic, but they never meet. But probability feels so... scientific. Not very special." Peter smiles, downing another shot. "However, if it's a matter of mental, or metaphysical, almost to the point of a religious nature, how are those who do evil with their powers? Given the graces of some outward force." A conspiratol look to Thomas. "I think it is balance."

"Or it is something we haven't even thought of," says Ming. "God has a sense of humor, in any case," she adds softly. "We don't even know why we are the way we are. Whether supernatural or merely mortal."

Thomas shakes his head. "You can be balanced - mentally or morally - and still do evil," he counters. "And even if initial conditions require some sort of mental state, once you actually have powers, it seems those conditions aren't required to keep 'em. You can be corrupted - or ennobled - without losing what you gained."

"I intended more for the cosmic sense of balance. I could quote good and evil but, eh." Smiling, Peter raises a finger. "Another thing to consider. If it's a matter of body and 'mind', potential both meta and physical, then how do powers develop from accidents that would otherwise kill someone?" That finger taps the table. "It could be, that the mind is willing, but there is no agent in the body to work on its' own. Or, that the body has a more passive agent; it is merely waiting for a catalyst to cling to. Enter the X-agent, the final element for all the potential is met."

Ming just listens for a time, consider the options again. She has thought of these things on many long nights. And as usual, there are no answers. "It seems another question that lies beyond knowing," she murmurs to herself, letting a little of her frustration creep out.

"It seems what you need, teacher, is presence right when powers manifest in a super," suggests Tom. "What do you suppose you could learn by being en rapport with someone at that time?"

"It is hard to say," says Ming. "I was present when powers vanished, once," she says. She can only assume that there are no secrets here. If Peter is like his brother, her secrets are all lost anyway. "I was not there when they returned, however."

"That's what makes it all so enteresting," reassures Peter with a smile that shines. "The questions that still remain. The mysteries out there are to keep us going; if all the answers were here, then half the challenge is over."

"I suppose it is interesting, though I am more interested in things that can be pursued scientifically rather than being at the whims of chance," says Ming. "There is no experiment that comes to mind to help in such a situation."

The conversation is brought to a polite close, and Ming and Thomas make their departure. The scientist has a lot to think about. "It's like trying to grasp a boulder," she mutters as she drives. "I have no place to begin, now," she adds more quietly.

"Give it time, professor," is Tom's advice, as he sits in the passenger seat and smiles out, watching scenery roll past. "A determined will can accomplish anything."
