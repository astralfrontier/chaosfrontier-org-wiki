# Millennium City Chronicles 2004-07-26

"I still say that we just go grab one of those huge freaking robot things, and pilot it into the funeral... I mean... it'd be a target rich environment." Guy chuckles at the image in his mind, "Er, however since we'll probably want to see who is there and what's for sale, we can see about slipping someone in their undercover. Or a few someones. Playing the villain isn't too hard. The problem is if there's any mentalists. Then they can read our minds and such. We might pull off being waiters or something. I dunno. I'd volunteer though. I think I would look good in a black cape and an uhm, you know, one with the high-backed collar..."

**Then you have just volunteered,** suggests the Ghost, as he stirs from his position in the team's base - or lair, given the suggestion of impersonating villains. **I will go with you. I want to learn more about those gathered.**

"So... anyone know if there's anything good on TV these days? I'm thinking about picking one up. I mean, I'll take the risk of having my brains melt out of my ears over heading into someplace where I'm outnumbered, outgunned and will likely end up in the plot next to whats-his-name inside 30 seconds." DarkGlow glares around. "I mean seriously--what can we really do there? If we had a tactical nuke or something--" He glances hopefully at Lydon. "--but otherwise it's long on risk and short on reward."

"I will go," says Ming. "Though I don't know how free these people will be with their actual plans. Then again, most men will speak volumes over a few drinks with an attractive woman." She smiles impishly and adds, "And I can dress inappropriately and have no guilt over it. If we're going to what might be our own funeral, we ought to go in style."

"Geh." DarkGlow stares at Ming. "Can at least 'borrow' your TV Guide before you sui-- I mean, go?"

Guy turns to Darkglow, "Oh... no, you're not gettin' out of this one. If I have to go be a villain, you get to be my lackey. Hmm. GK too probably. I think yeah... I know just the thing..."

DarkGlow smiles cheerily at Guy. "I'd say over your dead body, but that's likely to happen soon in any case."

The smirk on Lydon's face faulters a little. "No suitcase nukes. There is the simple fact that you are on board to do the humanitarian thing: find out if they are going to do any serious illegal activities afterwards. I trust your abilities to shield yourselves from the obvious issues." He smiles. "Besides, you of all people should fit in."

**Why worry?** asks GK, sounding almost casual. **Half of us are probably wanted by the police for questioning on some matter or other. We are hardly paragons of uprightness and respectability. Further, we are proposing to walk into a den of mutual distrust - odds are much better that a fight will break out between known rivals than against relative strangers.**

DarkGlow bows sardonically to Lydon, but holds his tongue.

Ming raises an eyebrow at GhostKnight. "And why would I be wanted by the police?" she asks suspiciously. "And I don't know that a fight between two of them is necessarily safe. Fortunately I think we can escape fairly quickly in a disaster."

DarkGlow scowls at GhostKnight. "So you're saying I'm more likely to die an innocent--relatively--bystander than as a front row combatant? Somehow I'm not encouraged by that..."

**Given the caution exercised in concealing the event thusfar,** suggests the dead-headed super, **I doubt they would attract attention to the event by instigating a brawl. Because everyone is willing to fight, nobody will.** He thinks for a moment, silently, then adds, **Perhaps.**

Guy nods, "If we keep the mindlink going, or eastablish it when we must, I know precisely how we can get out of there. Presuming that GK can cause more than just himself to go through stuff. If not, well then it's a little more tricky..."

"You guys are serious?" DarkGlow looks around at his compatriots with a look of faint disbelief. "Lunacy. At least it seems I've fallen in with the most appropriate crowd, however. I guess I'm in."

Thomas shakes his head. **I've never tried that. DarkGlow, you be much more reliable at such business, so I am grateful to hear that.**

"If I thought it was more likely to lead to disaster, I would not go," says Ming seriously. "We can do this, though. And we can help a lot of people, potentially."

Guy practices cackling like a villain. "Mwahahahahahah. Excellent... now then... onto business."

---

Stone walls deep with recesses and antechambers draw upwards into a dome consumed in darkness. Despite the lit torches - and more modern 100 watt lamps - shadows still cling to everything beyond the ambient glow. Still a sense of dread and eerie presence clings to the underground cathedral, long after the DEMON cell was cleared out by the Champions. Now, the altar is draped in a red cloth, housing an urn and a picture of the deceased, smiling triumphantly. Flowers, ranging from simple to morbid cluster about the foot of the altar, along with the nefarious, wicked, or odd tribute, like a bag of brownies. By the altar, a few women appear to in various stages of raw emotion, from tears to nearly fighting, and one or two of the men seem to have something in their eye, but are quite secretive about it.

The dress code runs the spectrum, from suits and ties, and respectable black dresses, to the flamboyant, gaudy, or just plain of muscle shirts, jeans and combat boots. Yet for the most part, all in attendance are out of costume; veils or masks for the identity modest, or in three cases, full power suits. The mourners are all over, some right by the altar, others quietly sitting in their seats or in the air by some means, while some lurk in the shadows alone or in pairs.

And so into the main hall walks another villain. Guy has donned a disguise for the evening... _I can't help but feel naked without my fedora..._ After spending the appropriate amount of time sizing up the competition as it were, he prepares to make his move. That is to say, he begins to schmooze, striking up small conversations here and there to learn what he might, as he makes his way towards the altar. _This place reeks of evil... heh, always wanted to say that._ ((Anything out of sorts guys?))

As Guy and the rest filter through the room, bits and pieces of conversation flit through their ears in passing. "There I was, surrounded by thirty guards, and-" "-I never thought to use that in a detonator. How about-" "-pollen, they clogged the fan in the Devastator's engine with pollen. I finally did catch up with them and-" "-sent him to bed without any supper. Just think what would have happened had he touched the lockdown controls. It's getting harder to-" "-find good reporting these days. The media never shows your good side, never gives you any credit or respect, it's like we're unreasonable _monsters_ or something."

(( So far so good. )) The Ghost Knight is holed up in one of the secret passages honeycombing the complex. From time to time he focuses on a conversation, using his ability to hear from afar to listen in on the proceedings. (( I'll be scanning for interesting information. Let me know if you need support. ))

As Guy moves forward, he finds himself moving towards a woman with ghostly pale skin, dressed in a leather jumpsuit. The man who was speaking with her notices Guy, as well, and moves away, muttering some sort of half-hearted excuse to get away from his companion. The reason might be her icy eyes, which slide to Guy and narrow as they study him. "Nice get-up," she rasps flatly.

Ming has herself dressed in a black bodysuit. She didn't need GhostKnight to make it for her. She actually owned one. She also is having little trouble fitting-in. She struts about, casually drawing the eyes of men. She's also wise enough to tone her flirting motions down whenever one of those men has a possessive woman at his side. She's here to talk, not entertain with a cat-fight. (( This might actually be amusing. ))

((Amusing?)) Guy regards the icy eyed woman, ((She really should get out more. Computer tan and all...)) In his best 'villain' voice, he responds, "Why thank you, I put it together myself. It comes in handy every now and then. Once saved my neck when I was being pursued... and you are?"

Every now and then, little chrome spheres will float above the gathered, lenses sweeping the area, or emit the soft whirrr of machinery.

The ice lady snorts and lets her eyes slide up and down Guy's form for a moment. "Poison," she replies in that same flat rasp. She's not much for talk, it seems. "What do you do and who are you?" she asks.

((So, I don't suppose any of you know who Poison is...)) GGuy smiles, but he does his best to make sure it's not too out of place. "I am th\[D\[D\[D\[DThe Merciless uh, Mind. As for what I do... well, that depends on the time of day..."

(( So far I've not learned a great deal. )) Ming doesn't sound very pleased with that, but she does know the problem. (( I think if I can find someone who is interested in drinking with me I will learn more. Something might be of profit in this yet. )) She will casually hint to well-built gentleman that she would love to get herself a drink.

An adjacent room contains a fridge and a wide table of refreshments. Here, a half dozen guests drift, picking at the food, talking, simply watching. Off of the store room is a back hall, where chairs have also been assembled. Lacking the somber air, here the louder guests have gathered, talking and cutting up, or playing a game of cards. Flanking the main hall's doors are two identical men, arms crossed, watching expectantly. In the two other rooms, the same man stands aside the door, unmoved.

Guy says, "Generally though, I work as a freelance mastermind. Times are tough these days."

A hand reaches out from the crowd and siezes Ming's shoulder. Twisting her bodily around, contemptuous blue eyes in an otherwise almost pretty face rake her shapely form from beneath a wash of slightly curled, boyish blonde locks. "You," the man states, mouth twisted list the or d'hourves hadn't agreed with him. "I hearda you. Didn't think you'd show." He releases her abruptly, looks around at the swirling masses. "'Course I never thought I'd be showin' up here neither. Look at all these pansies, would ya? Half or more of 'em hated the bastard's guts."

Cold eyes from the crowd flick at him, presumably from the other half. He calmly stares them down, and with an unconcerned air, straightens his slightly bulging business suit and loosens the tie as if putting it on for these people had been a bad idea. He focuses on Ming again. "Well, why you here?" he demands.

"The Merciless Mind," deadpans Poison. "I've never heard of you." She leans a little closer and snorts softly, apparently unimpressed. "A mastermind with none of his own ideas, is that what you are saying?" Somehow she seems amused by this.

Ming is more than a little surprised. But she manages to recover herself enough to avoid disaster. "I thought I would pay my respects, and perhaps learn something of use. The same reason most everyone is here," says Ming. She frowns deeply and demands in turn, "And just why are you here?"

"Of course you haven't. It's a sign that I've been doing my work well." Guy, or rather the Merciless Mind smiles, and regards poison curiously. "Ah, well if that's what you'd like to believe, then that is what you will. It's not what I'm saying. And I don't think you are stupid enough to misunderstand me... so, you'll have to find another way to make smarmy remarks."

"...and they have what kind of security systems?" A sly voice croons into the Ghost Knight's clairaudient perception. He's been eavesdropping on this particular trio for the last two minutes, who seem to be hashing out the beginnings of a technical lab heist in Austin; a friend of a friend is a disenfranchised pilot of a top-secret power suit, and he wants it. Of course, this is just one of three conversations the Knight is currently tapping. Then he abandons one; the plight of Insidious's nightshade garden is simply not all that thrilling.

Poison grins and keeps her cold eyes on the Merciless Mind. "I imagine I may have to do that. You seem to be another one of these.. unfocused, lost souls," she says evenly. "They squirm and struggle, but never get very far.."

"Pfft. Tell me another one. I ain't one to listen to rumours, but they all say the same things about you, and it ain't that you had the hots for the dead guy." He scowls in the general direction of the casket. "Me, I'm here to see if'n I can pick up a trinket or two. He was a twit, but they say there wasn't anything wrong with his gadgets." He waves an aggrieved hand at the crowd, and then flexes a muscle covered in a material that wasn't designed to stretch. He quickly stops before repairs are required. "I mean, look. I could crumple most of these morons into lumpy, wet balls--except for those creeps." He indicates the powersuiters. "An' they could do the same to me--and they don't even need to sweat to do it. It's getting so's you gotta learn the tech and get outfitted with gadgets just to stay ahead. Unless you're you, of course." He smiles nastily at Ming.

"Unfocused, lost souls tend to get swallowed by bigger fish when they squirm and struggle. I'm sure you know that quite well." Guy raises an eyebrow curiously, "And what exactly is it you're here for, Poison? The pleasant company?"

Ming smirks back. "So you think the clutz left something useful lying around, hmm? Well, I suppose he might have, at that. But I've no head for such things. Still, just because it's not useful in my hands doesn't mean it wouldn't be worth having. I know a few men who could get me in touch with some Egyptian friends of theirs, and they are always after weapons. And they are so very well-funded. I wouldn't mind making a fair deal at all."

Poison snorts, "I'm here for the same reason most are. To find my next job." Her unpleasant smile shifts to a neutral expression, "I must admit, I do love my work."

"And what is it you do," _Besides snort like a pig_ Guy waits patiently for an answer, while scanning the room. "And I don't suppose you've heard about any of the toys being put up for sale tonight?"

A man of Mediterranean discent steps inside, the dark coat outlining an impressive arsenal beneath. He immediately locks eyes with a man in street clothes. Several seconds tick by, the adjacent mourners growing quiet and tense as the locked stare could split atoms. Finally, a short fellow grabs the coated man on the arm, dragging him towards the refreshment room.

"It's not his style to sell his work," answers Poison. "As for me. I track people, then I kill them. But only if the pay is right." She turns her eyes to study the mountain of weaponry. She does not tense, but there is a sense of readiness in her that fades somewhat when the man moves away. "I have been very busy lately, but I'm waiting for my contact to give me the next hit, so I have a few days free."

The man eyes Ming consideringly. "Yeah, y'look like ya got foreign connections. Still, always b'lieved in the old saw, 'buy American'. I mean, ya gotta draw the line somewhere, right? Now if only I could figure out if there's an auction or something, and how to get an invite." He leans forward conspiriatorily. It probably isn't a coincidence he now crowds her almost overwhelmingly. "Truth be told, I was hopin' to borrow a few of those brains in that pretty li'l head o' yours. Thought you might have a bit of... insight into the matter, if you're catchin' my drift. I'm, as you say, well-funded m'self, and if you could slide a little info my way, I'd be willin' to talk finder's fee." He steps back, looks around. "No need to say anythin' now. But later I'll look you up." He glances again towards the casket, then chuckles at Ming. "Y'know, I heard that the fool had a heart attack and accidentally blew himself up with his own self-destruct system. How's that for looney?"

"I see. Well then he's not the one doing the selling... unless you're aware of something I'm not." Guy tilts towards the mountain of weaponry, shaking his head, "Bah. Well that was interesting. Who are those two?"

"It seems a likely situation," says Ming, grinning to herself. "He was more than a little insane. Building a self-destruct definitely fits his mind-set." She adds more quietly, "I'll.. look into a few places and see what I can find. I'm sure we could find something worthwhile. No doubt some of his beneficaries want to peddle their trinkets."

The man nods approvingly, contempt easing into a smile. "That's what I like to hear, an' I'll hope to hear more later. You enjoy yourself now--if y'can with this bunch all around..." He heads off, though with his strength he doesn't melt into the crowd as much as part it. Even so, he's quickly lost to view.

"That one's Dead-Eye," comments a burbling voice besides Guy. A glance over provides the sight of a freakish, partially gelatinous... thing. Iridescent under the lights, rays bouncing through the clear innards and across the translucent slime. Its' head melts back downwards, before drawn up in a spiral like some rope, hovering over Guy's shoulder. "The other is... some human name I cannot pronounce." A bubbling chuckle, as the creature droops into a puddle. "Mortal enemies... or odd friends." The thing flows up onto the altar to inspect the urn, before sticking a wet tentacle into a flowerpot.

Poison looks at the gelatinous creature, then to Guy, and uses this distraction to step away, towards the more active part of the gathering.

Among his sorting through the conversations above, two catch the Knight's ear. First is during the poker game, where among other things, are betting information on superheros, secret plans, weapons caches, and favors. The stakes are getting higher, and worth noting. The other, however, is not unique - simple conversation - albeit the voice attached is someone he recognizes. While tone and inflection are altered, the Knight cannot put his finger on the person.

Inside the refreshment room, a woman dressed like a waitress cleans up discarded cups, bringing them to the trash. Discreetly, a piece of cloth is swiped across their insides, and placed into a bag in her purse.

Carefully, GK detaches himself from his hiding place, and a late arrival - wearing black body armor, not an uncommon fashion choice in this company, along with a black cloth tied around his brow and hanging loosely over his face - moves carefully among the mourners.

Homing in on that conversation, the Knight spots his quarry. A woman, chatting with another in a flamboyant costume of blues and purples. Her hair has been dyed, her posture changed slightly, with a more of a shoulder-back tilt, as opposed to near perfect straightness. The lengths have even been undertaken to alter her cheeks and waist, adding just a hint of weight to it. Even so, the vigilante sees right through it, spotting Arlene Raymond.

Ming will move towards the poker table, lingering where the stakes are highest, preferably near someone who appears to be winning. (( You know, in other circumstances, this might be fun. )) If she wasn't surrounded by criminals, for example.

With a satisfied smile, Tom allows himself to mill about in the crowd, cursing for a moment his lack of a camera before realizing he has a ready substitute. Chris had mentioned "something big" in the works for the reporter; but if he were to go and gloat now, he would tip his own hand. Best to stay back and continue surveillance.

A squeaky voice cuts through the din from behind Ming. "Oh, miss! Miss!"

Ming frowns, cradling her drink (which she is wise enough not to really make use of) and turning to see just who is daring to bother her. She says nothing, but waits for some explanation.

A kid, a boy of ten or maybe twelve, is trying to drag his reluctant mother towards Ming. "Come, now, Oscar, the lady is probably very busy and doesn't want to be disturbed." The boy is undeterred. "Oh, Mom! But I heard that big guy talking and you know it's gotta be her!" He succeeds in pulling the older woman closer to Ming.

Ming arches an eyebrow and looks down at the child, then towards his mother. She offers the slightest of nods to the woman. "It seems to be my night for having unexpected conversations," she muses, allowing the smallest of smirks to form on her lips.

"Really, Oscar," the mother says, giving up. She looks like a harried housewife--no one seeing her can really picture her in any sort of costume, but she must be somehow special if she's here at all. "Now you be polite--I'd really rather remember this evening and not just have a blank spot in my head."

The boy pulls a battered book out of a pocket. His eager grin tells the world he having the time of his life--the book has probably seen a lot of action tonight. "Would you mind signing this?" he asks. "I've heard so much about you!"

Ming then notices the Asian man, coated in tattoo murals, who was moving towards her through the furniture like a shark. Of course, he holds up as the child, and his conspicious mother get in the way. Instead, he weaves around the poker table.

For his part, GK - incognito - decides that the stakes are indeed going up. He ambles his way toward Poker, deciding to see what he can see.

Ming doesn't even pause, but reaches out to take the pen. She considers it for a moment and smirks. The book is considered for a moment, just to see what other names are in there. She tsks for a moment, then asks, "What is your name? I need to make this out to someone."

"Oscar," he tells her proudly. Somewhat quieter he adds, "I don't have a super name yet. Mom says I gotta grow up more first."

"We have two canisters of nerve gas, a mystical pair of revolvers, and the Secret identity of Pincer on the line. Okay boys. Show your cards." The androgynous being hidden behind a veil lays down a trio of kings. "Ha!" Declares a man in a visor. "Royal flush! I win!" "Wait a second." The gruff, beast of a man, coated in scales, drops his cards on the table: a full house, containing a king. The table goes silent.

The guard by the door walks forward as the trio at the table stare from one to the other. "Aren't you an illusionist," asks the scaled thing to the androgynous one. The guard is then behind all three of them, a heavy hand laid on their shoulder. "Either take it outside, and I will watch your earnings, or it," a pat upon the veiled one's shoulder, "forfeits all of its' earnings." More silence.

_Ah, 'Oscar' really sucks as a name. Why won't Mom let me have a real name? I'm almost growed up! And I can fly, too, even if I bump my head on the ceiling all the time. Sky-something or.. or. Oh, I dunno. But Black Thought--that's such a cool name. And it's funny how she keeps making the cops look dumb in... er, where does she live? I forget. But she looks so cool--even if I thought she'd be bigger..._

Two floating spheres have taken up residence above the poker table, swiveling around and watching the trio of potential combattants. From one corner, a mere... presence chuckles in the otherwise empty seat, moving a bishop forwards. Finally, the veiled one rises. "I will withdraw from the game." It vanishes. Sliding into the chair is the Asian tattoo mural. "Deal me in a hand."

Ming smiles and artfully signs off her name, but not in English. She whips it off in cursive Cantonese, adding an elegance to the script that would do even the best criminal proud. She playfully addresses it (in English) to: 'Oscar, who shall one day rock the heavens as Skylance'. She adds as a last thought: 'We expect great things from you'.

The boy squeaks laughter. His feet come off the ground and he almost floats away before his mother hauls him back down. "Thanks so much," she says breathlessly to Ming. To her child, she's more curt. "Now what have I told you about your powers? You have to concentrate--I don't want you to just float away into the sky..." Her voice fades as they move away.

Something nearly purrs by Ming's ear. "My appreciation for humoring the child." Something flits across her field of vision, before it is gone.

(( I am so in over my head here. )) Ming looks around and sighs inwardly. (( There has to be a way to find out if there is going to be an auction of some kind. There's no telling what might be sold. )) She looks around, seeking someone who appears to know what they are doing. The guards she considers for a moment, tapping her lip. But that's unlikely to help. If she were hiring guards, she'd not want them to know secrets of mine. And as a guard, knowing secrets of your master is a bad trait, as well.

From the poker table, "So, when's the dead guy's stuff getting read out?" "The will? Probably at the reception. Anyone mentioned in it will probably be hunted down when they sign the guest book." "And his technology?" "Uh... hm. I'll have to hunt down Sinistra," Comments the Visor-toting man. "So, about that nerve gas..."

The Ghost Knight has a plan. It's not the best in the world, but his intellect in the past has often substituted convincing-seeming rationales for his impulsive choices. He approaches the table, moving into the "bull-pen" for a place at the table.

One of the table-goers gets up, giving the Knight his seat as he heads beyond into the refreshment room. "We're out of ice," declares someone in the adjacent room. The sound of a weapon going off issues forth. "Nevermind."

There's a man leaning insouciantly against the wall near the altar. He's wearing cheap sunglasses, wingtips and a cheap scarlet suit resembling the "zoot suit" of the 1940's. It comes complete with black tie and overly broad shoulders. His hair is a rich silvery color, and waves wildly atop his head. His lip curls sardonically around a cigarette, which emits a steady stream of smoke. He could be at home playing the saxophone in a dusky jazz bar from decades back; he doesn't look so much out of place as out of time.

Despite having been there for more time than he'd care to admit, DarkGlow can't seem to pull himself away from the wall. Too many people here strike him as the kind of person he'd really rather be a state or two away from. Pulling away from the wall and actually acting social seems distinctly unhealthy, GhostKnights words about them blending in naturally notwithstanding. Minutes tick by as he tries to stay equidistant from the closest others, and he pays scant attention to the noise that assaults his ears. Once or twice he sees Ming's form through gaps in the crowd, and he feels a twinge as he sees the once-and-future professor handling herself so well. He circles, staying with the wall, attempting to keep her in sight. Eventually he sees GhostKnight in his current costume striding through the press of bodies towards a table. _Wasn't he staying out of sight? Damn it, I'd better get closer in case something stupid happens._ He pauses, then taps his forehead moderately hard. _Just make c_

_certain you don't cause it._

_Well at least I know theres some accounting for taste around here._ Guy turns towards the man who looks like he belongs in a 40s detective novel. So, the Merciless Mind makes his way towards the jazzman, looking a little less not-so-in-place. "Hlo."

DarkGlow lets the shadows fall away from him, and steps cautiously forward.

"Hey, gate," the stranger replies from behind his impenetrable shades, in a smokey voice that rolls off the tongue like honey-coated gravel. It's a voice of the night, the voice the neighborhood's stray tomcat given human form. "You lookin' for someone?"

Ming, who is posing as Black Thought tonight (by accident!) is going to try and eavesdrop for now. Not avoiding notice, of course. She likes having people look at her. And she doesn't want to change her behavior right now. Hopefully she can hear something useful.

"Nothin in particular." _This guy sounds familiar. And for some reason I get the feeling I should be doing a cheesy voiceover about now. And this should be black and white. Yeah. The guy was standing by the altar, smokin', looking nonchalant. Anyone looking nonchalant had to be up to somthing._ "Who are you?"

"Real pity about the cat they're about to plant," the man says around his cigarette, then reaches up to remove it from his lips. Rolling it around between his fingers, he stares at Guy - or what must be staring, given the shades - and then smiles wide. "Sparks. Tha's me." Using the cig as a pointing device, he gestures at Guy. "Haven't seen you around the scene. You new?"

Ming overhears a conversation consisting of the casual interview of a plain-dressed man from an unremarkable woman. While subtle, it's clear she's probing: what his powers are, what connections he has. Finally, she slides a card into his pocket and drifts through the crowd, leaving her conversation partner lost.

"Cryin shame at that." Guy nods, then glances towards the casket. "Yeah. New. New to this scene anyway. Go way back though. You know. And you? Here in hopes of th will?"

Sparks gives an ugly laugh. "I'm lookin for some real alley cats," he says. "Need some guys with grey upstairs. Brains, dig? Important job I need." He rolls the cigarette a few more times before taking a long drag from it. "Hear you might be just the cat I'm lookin' for."

"Izzat so... I dig." Guy chuckles to himself. _And then it hit me. Not only did I dig, but I realized what this guy was up to. He was planning some kind of job, and I was to be the brains behind it. Too bad he didnt know what trouble he was gonna be in. I played along._ "I have my fair share of things goin on upstairs. Whatcha need?"

"There's a no-good gunsel up in the Big Apple, thought he'd do me dirty," grumbles Sparks. "I've got a lot of love for the big V but that cat done gone. I did a good deed for him back when he was still suckin' air and I'm hoping karma's goin' to be good to me with his friends, dig? I want him messed up. Bad." The man chews so hard on his cigarette that it fragments, with the still-burning end falling unnoticed to the floor. "I want him regrettin' the day his momma pushed him out."

Ming glides around the room, flirting casually as she does. (( So everyone thinks I'm Black Thought. If the real one shows up we're going to see true issues. But I imagine I can find a way to fake past it. )) Which will include turning invisible and getting the hell away. She pauses as she moves about the place, looking for a familiar face. (( Someone should try to find out where this cursed auction will be. I'd hate to have to burst someone's mind just to find out. ))

"I see." Guy shakes his head slowly. "Well I will need to know a little more about this gunsel but I can probably help ya out." _Gunsel? I had to wonder if anyone still used words like that. Apparently they did._ "Yeah. You heard anything about that auction going on a little later? Might be able to pick up something to help..."

Ming does spot someone. She's seated in the pews, hiding her face partially behind a veil. There's a few individuals around her, seeming to be comforting her. The woman's face was in the file they received from Moriarity: Sinistra, Vulcan's supposed mistress.

"At the reception," Sparks answers grudgingly. "If you're the cat I'm after, find me then." That said, he puts his foot down, crushing out the half-burnt cigarette and moving away.

Ming pauses in her flirting, her manner growing more serious and somber as she detaches herself from the louder crowd to make her way towards the mourning Sinistra. She will wait until the woman notices her, then offer her a polite nod. "You have my sympathy," she says simply.

Sinistra turns, her voice laced with an Eastern European lilt. "Thank you." It's clear that she's still a little affected, and either she's a real good actor, or serious.

Ming reaches behind her back, drawing out a silken handkerchief, which she offers to Sinistra. "It will take some time, but it will start to hurt less," she offers softly. "If there is something I can do to help you at this time. There are no doubt many trifles that are wasting your time now.."

Collecting the kerchief with a weak smile, "Thank you. I am fine. The reception is being handled by my associates, I'm just seeing over the will reading." She turns to one of the men in waiting, speaking to him in a foreign voice, before he scuttles off. "You are Black Thought? I am not familiar with many American personalities."

Ming nods to Sinistra. "It is odd, I did not expect to be recognized by so many," she says. "I will have to be more secretive in the future. One can never be too careful."

"I'm sure your reputation proceeds you." She glances up as the man returns with a cup, which she sips from. "I will be heading to the reception soon, De Colato will be giving the Eulogy here in a few minutes. You are welcome to come."

"I would be honored," replies Ming. "Provided my associates have not caused me trouble. It would not do to spoil this evening with any interruptions." She considers for a moment, "Would you mind if I attended the reading of the will? If it is exclusive to the involved parties, I will understand."

She seems quiet for a moment, before offering, "We will see. I do not mean to be so cold, but you cannot be careful who you let too close. I will see you at the hotel."

Ming bows her head to Sinistra. "I understand," she says. "Hopefully we may speak later." She nods politely and detaches herself from the conversation, making her way to less difficult waters. (( Well, I have an invite to the reception, at least. ))

Elsewhere, things are heating up. The mysterious figure at the Poker table doesn't particularly stand out - or sit out, in this case. A lot of mysterious people are here at the funeral; Thomas Temple is no different. Finally it comes his turn to deal. He shuffles quickly, neatly, and efficiently, using his powers subtly to guide his hands as though they were those of an expert. The cards are cut three times by those at the table - but once they're back in his hand, none of that matters. Tom analyzes the stack and commits the order to memory. Then he starts dealing, with a smile on his face hidden by the mask he wears. This game is all but won.

All ante up as the cards are delt. The scaled one looks over the cards, and passes two forward. "Gimmie two." Visor-man, dubbed "Blink" passes three cards in. The mural painted man cashes in one.

The one they are calling Black Thought, sensing Thomas' victory is essentially a cinch, will casually walk herself to the table. She looks at the pile and laughs softly. "Is this what you call a wager? Such a sad little thing to honor a man such as this. Well, I will fix this. My night is on the table, boys." She sets herself on the table casually, looking at each man in the game.

Three sets of eyes appraise the new stake, and exchange looks. The pot grows with some decency. A canister of nerve gas, the pass codes to a storage facility that is assured to contain interesting material. Some kind of glowing medallion, which is gold, so it's worth something at least. A test-tube full of cocaine. "Play your cards." A pair of aces. Three jacks. A simple straight.

The count is accurate. Thomas' mastery of the cards, their position, and their disposition never wavered. He bluffed, he lost, but it was a sham. Final victory is his - in spite of the unusual contents of the pot - and with a satisfied hum he taps his victorious cards on the table and begins collecting the spoils.

Black Thought purrs as she surveys the winner. "Well, I do love the outfit. I hope you are as skilled out of it." She offers up a smokey glance at GhostKnight and slips from the table to his side, brushing against him and offering her hand to him. "To the victor goes the spoils," she whispers.

There's some annoyances between those at the table, but they don't raise a fuss. After several minutes though, as if some inaudible summons had been rang, many of the patrons begin filtering out, into the room proper.

A dark skinned man, going on in his years, steps up to the altar, before turning towards the pews. Silence consumes the main room, as most of the guests find their seats. As if on cue, heads bow, and a moment of quiet contemplatin goes up. Then the speaker begins to talk, his accent a peculiar one, a voice rich and deep, made for speaking. "Respect, grief, greed, whatever has brought us here, it is because of Vulcan. Most of us have been touched in one way or another by him. Your friend, your boss, your associate. Even as your enemy, Vulcan had class, a man from a generation of illegal entrepenours you just don't find anymore."

"I could lie to you and say he was a _good_ man. I could stretch the truth and say he was a nice man. But instead, I will you about what he did, and you can make the destinction." A sad smile crosses his face. "One of his favorite anecdoets was about the on-and-off confrontations between he and the League. Once, in Morocco, he had fully dismantled Dynamo's suit, destroyed Forge's equipment, essentially had the entire League under his boot heel. Instead of killing any of them, he merely said 'Leave, and do not come back for three months. I give you mercy, now give me a vacation from your antics.'"

The eulogy continues, praising the deceased with honesty and passion. It slowly winds down, before all bow their head. It's announced the reception will be in the Adam's Mark hotel; two entrances, via the freight elevator, or the back entrance. There, a silent auction will be held, along with a small celebration in honor of the great man.
