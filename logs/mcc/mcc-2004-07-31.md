# Millennium City Chronicles 2004-07-31

Sunday, 2AM. The rain has been coming down in sheets for a good twenty minutes, but the dark form of a woman lingers on a rooftop high above the alley behind the Wolf's Grin bar. Her eyes, unblinking, stare at the back door that Joseph Malankov favors.

Mr. Malankov has reason to celebrate. Recently he managed to beat not one, but three different charges of sexual assault. Unfortunately for him, a more certain justice has taken note of him, and it stands poised to put an end to his deeds for all time.

She has never said her own name, but among those who listen to rumors, the face of Scorpio is hard to miss. Red, emotionless eyes that never seem to blink, dark blue hair, and a set of waving, black tatoos that flow over her whole body.

Outside the bar, there's a man dressed in ratty clothes, soaked through by the rain. Nevertheless he doesn't seem bothered by the chill. He slouches with the same degree of insouciant expectation that one might find in any other street dealer. He flags down Malankov as the man makes to pass, bobbing his head a bit as he begins making an offer of some kind.

Malankov pauses to look at the strange man. He's listening, but he's clearly hesitant. "Well, we're always looking for new clients, but we run things safe these days. I'd have to have my boys check this all out, you know. Can never be too careful these days, can you?"

Unseen from below, there is no longer a woman on the roof, nor has there been for a few seconds. Malankov grins, gesturing to two men who are just stepping out of the bar's backdoor behind him, "Hey boys, this guy has a deal for us. You check him out, and maybe this will really be our lucky day!"

The would-be flashes smiles a disturbing and sharklike grin. From within his body, black armor emerges - unfolding through the skin like an obsidian origami, surmounted by a grinning white skull. The erstwhile dealer's head is wrapped in this fearsome mask, and a long black coat snaps outward, catching the wind as it's freed from its fleshly confines. **Maybe it won't be,** counters the Ghost Knight.

The two thugs waste no time. "Shit, it's him!" Hands go to guns all around. Even Malankov makes a move for his pistol. Before he even gets it out, one of his men are screaming as a large scorpion stinger whips about, stabbing into the back of his thigh and sending him to his knees. The form of Scorpio is just there suddenly, looming behind the fallen man, her red eyes catching the dim lights and glowing against the shadows.

Needless to say GK is more than a little surprised. He's still an alert combatant, though, and with a rapid gesture he summons a pair of steel fire-escape supports into his hands, shaping them into weapons in an instant. With a single sweep he disarms the equally surprised, but insufficiently prepared, Malankov.

The thug wheels about, unsure just what to do. The hesitation does not earn him a sting, though. At least not directly. Scorpio is focused on the kill, and a simple man, even armed, is not a serious threat. A black fluid drips from her stinger and like a lance it springs at Malankov, bringing with it the black touch of death.

The aim of Scorpio is as true as ever. The sentence about to fall, only surprisingly the remaining thug throws himself in the way. "Look out boss!" the man bellows. With an audible thunk the sting falls into his shoulder, the power of it puncturing the man's shoulderblade.

The Ghost finishes off Malankov with an accurate, expert blow with his improvised clubbing weapons. As the man goes down in an unconscious heap, the vigilante holds up a gloved hand. **Wait! This man will die. What are you here to accomplish?**

Scorpio turns her eyes on the Ghost Knight, staring at him for a while. With an odd, insectoid precision she begins to use sign language. Her answer is: The rapist dies. The rest are unjudged.

The vigilante in black watches with a wary expression. His empty eyesockets narrow by degrees, studying this stranger. **You are mute,** he concludes. **I am afraid I do not understand your words. Yet this man must still be saved.**

Scorpio nods just barely. She offers a more direct form of expression. She points at Malankov and draws a finger across her throat. She gestures to the rest, then makes a dismissive gesture, trying to indicate that they are not part of her purpose.

That, at least, Tom can understand. **What will be the value in his death?** he asks, as he warily hunches down to begin performing whatever first aid he can muster.

Scorpio looks to the man and shakes her head. She holds up a finger, the usual sign for 'one moment'. She considers the rooftops, takes a few steps over to one, and leaps straight up to the top. For a moment, there is no change, then there is a flash of light from the roof and a different face peers over the edge. The face is just as attractive as Scorpio's, but far less severe, even with the horns of a goat crowning it. "She made a mistake," the woman says flatly, sounding extremely upset. She looks around for a moment, then begins making her way carefully down a fire escape. "They always come to me whenever they make a mistake," she adds, letting out a sigh.

**And you are?** asks the Ghost Knight, warily, all the while eyeing the narrow confines of the battle-scene as though half-expecting more visitors to arrive at any moment.

The newcomer makes good time down the fire escape, letting herself drop that last few yards. "My name is Capricorn, of course," she says. She reaches up, taps her horns, "They come with the territory. So Scorpio had to make her move. She's been growing impatient. Well, I imagine, anyway. With her, you'd never think it was possible." She moves over to the first man struck and nods, "He'll be alright in a while. She has two venoms, you see.. but this one." And here Capricorn frowns deeply, settling herself by the downed man. "Just a moment, please.."

Still wary, GK backs up. He notes a few pistols lying on the ground, well outside the restraining aura of their former users, and with a casual gesture gathers them into his hands for safe-keeping. **You are a team?** he concludes.

"Sometimes," says Capricorn. She shuts her eyes and lets out a long sigh. When her lungs are completely emptied she tenses, and the man thrashes, his eyes springing open suddenly. Before he can push away, Capricorn's voice sets to work, "Shhh, not so fast. Take it easy. Here, take my hand and I'll help you up." The Ghost Knight will likely notice that the wound is gone completely, the healer's talent having worked perfectly.

Thomas is impressed, but says nothing. Now is not the time to slip out of character, and at any rate, the situation must be further explained. **What about the matter of Malankov?** he asks, nodding in the direction of the senseless mobster.

"I will heal him shortly, unless you will not allow it," says Capricorn. "Perhaps you are confused, which is understandable. Scorpio is the one who does.. that kind of thing. I am just a healer. I don't want to ever hurt anyone, and Libra would never try to make me do so. They all know that I do not fight people." The stunned thug just stands there, staring at his healer, his jaw looking ready to drop to the floor.

**... Excuse me a moment.** The Ghost strides over, balling up a fist as he drops his improvised implements. He slams his armored fist hard into the last thug's gut; the man doubles over, falling down like his fellows with naught but a faint hissing of breath. **You may heal whomever you like,** he says.

"But.. if you do that again.." Capricorn looks confused. "I do not wish to heal them if it will only get them more pain. What do you mean to do with these men? As I understand it, this Malankov person is a rapist, and Libra has assured us all of his guilt. That one I have never known to be wrong yet. And yet the people of this place will not put him in prison." Here the Zodiac lets out a sad sigh, "To see illness in such a critical system is a tragedy. But I cannot heal everything, I guess." The last sentence is clearly something she hates to admit.

The Ghost cannot discount out of hand the allegations. **I intended to exact a confession from him,** he explains. **I now have another matter to see to in the confession as well, it seems. If this Scorpio will oppose me, we shall settle that business now. Otherwise I will wake him and we will..talk.**

"Scorpio will not be coming out for a while," says Capricorn. "She is likely going to spend hours analyzing just what went wrong. Next time she will not doubt succeed. If there is a next time." Capricorn sounds far from happy about that, though. "Are you injured? And what do you wish to do with these men? Since I am here, I may as well help you. I heal them if they are injured. I imagine your methods of interrogation are rather harsh, and while I cannot stop you from doing as you will, I can volunteer to try and prevent any permenant damage to these men."

**That will be useful,** says the Ghost's unliving voice, leaving no doubt that such a capability will be exercised heavily in a short while.

The rooftop seems as good a place as any. Two unconscious thugs lie below, small radio transmitters nestled into the butts of their pistols. There isn't even any blood here, which is good. Malankov came conscious when the pair expected it, and after a short, informative session in which the Ghost laid out his options (confession to the police or Scorpio), the man sang like a bird.

Malankov can't really get hit for the rapes, now. Or so he thinks. Civil trials being what they are, he's far from safe. However, he admits to having a cop killed and to running the drug ring in the area. He keeps eyeing the Ghost, then looking over at Capricorn. The mix of sad, compassionate eyes and the grim mask of the Ghost's face puts such a terror in him now that his begging nearly makes him incoherent during parts of his confession.

**Remember,** concludes the Ghost, **Justice will find you. Prefer that it be through the courts. Go and confess your sins to the police. If you do not, your fate will be decided by someone whose intentions toward you are already quite clear. Do you understand?**

Malankov nods quickly, trying to scramble to his feet. Oddly, Capricorn pushes him down. Her words are simple. "I am a healer. I fix people who are hurt. I do not want to hurt anyone, but I cannot stand in the way of justice, and will not for a man who harms others intentionally. If your name is not in the paper tomorrow, I will bow once again to Libra. She will no doubt consider things carefully and send Scorpio after you again. Few people have seen her and lived."

"No one has ever escaped justice when the order has been given," Capricorn adds, sounding oddly sad. She allows the man to get up, then, and Malankov is eager to get off the rooftop.

**I intend to follow him - to save his life,** explains the Ghost, though he appears to have some time before departing. **Tell your associate Scorpio one thing for me, please - a living man can repent. A living man can tell his friends to fear you. He can inspire compliance with just and upright behavior by being a living witness. A dead man is merely a statistic.**

"You do not understand Scorpio, I'm afraid," says Capricorn. "Nor do I, in all honesty. Not completely. But I do know this. The judgement is not in her hands. She is an executioner. She has no joy in her work. She has nothing of what you might call pride, either, from what I can tell. She fails once on an attempt, she stops and analyzes it, calls on any who might help, and then finishes her duty. That is all. I feel sad for her, but her healing can only come from patience." Capricorn shifts gears and says, "I'm sorry. I did not get your name. You seem a fair man, despite your appearance."

**I had a name when I lived,** Thomas says, using the dead voice he's perfected in the many months of his curious duty. **I am now the Ghost Knight, brought from one Crusade to fight another.**

"Perhaps the Ghost Knight, who stands half in shadow and half in the light of mercy can help heal my sister," says Capricorn. "There is a core to her somewhere that may recall something else. Somewhere. I promise you she will not attack him for at least three days. Libra has a lot of new evidence to consider, and I do not plan on rushing things for her. Virgo will be so happy if this all works to plan. She may have to send you a thank you card. She's been fretting over this all week."

Holding out a hand, the black-clad super assembles a business card out of tiny fragments, seemingly oozing out of his hand like liquid paper and into a solid whole. He presents it without further flourish. **I can be reached here,** he explains.

Capricorn takes the card and smiles to herself. "Thank you. If you are ever injured, or need something special, well.. We're working on ways to get in touch with us that are safe. It's a challenge. We don't want to get anyone in trouble. It's not healthy to have too much to do with the Zodiac."

**Then I will not trouble you further,** says the Ghost Knight, stepping back. His booted foot rises up, cresting the edge of the roof, and then he drops - and is gone, vanished, off to trail Malankov to ensure a complete confession after all.

With the Ghost Knight gone, Capricorn looks up at the cloudy sky. "Always rains on me," she murmurs. "Yes, I know it's your fair turn, dear," she whispers quietly. Another flicker of light, and Zodiac's form shifts once more, to that of a woman with violet eyes, lips, and hair. Her glowing eyes study her surroundings for a moment and she nods. "He's a good man. I hope he manages it. Even Libra will be pacified." She looks down to the card and carefully tucks it away before she turns to fly off through the air. "The Zodiac is at peace again. Just have to get poor Megan to her hotel room, now."
