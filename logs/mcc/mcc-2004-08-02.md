# Millennium City Chronicles 2004-08-02

Thomas Temple stands in one of the (officially unused) storage rooms in a Yamaguchi-owned building in Millennium City. Like FoxMecha, a combination of business and science takes place here. The upper floors are dead and deserted at this late hour of the night; the lower floors, packed with the trappings of technology, are unpowered for the most part, nestled in comforting electronic dreams until morning. With him is Chris Green, the only other person in the building at the moment, and certainly the only other person who's seen what Tom brought her here to demonstrate.

The nano-armor rests on a steel framework approximately emulating the dimensions of the Ghost Knight's own body. The surface is the deep black of outer space, though there are no stars visible in its void. Unlike the Ghost's former armor, with its bulky build and overcoat, this is thin and form-fitting. A dancer or gymnast could perform while wearing it. A cloak hangs next to the suit, sharing with it the same obsidian hue and carbon construction. It flares at the shoulders and neck; there's enough extra material to be drawn up as a hood, and a clasp at the collar to keep it in place.

A computer display nearby reveals the underlying structure: layers of carbon atoms formed into nanotubes, like a suit of chainmail at the molecular level, and shepherded about by tiny robot gears. Tom explains: "Right now, those nanomachines function to change the shape, texture and color of the armor on command. But soon, these tubes can be used to carry heat away from the wearer to shield from fire, or to keep him warm in the cold; they can conduct electricity safely away from skin; they can even form a surface on which semiconductors were imprinted on the fly, creating a computer across every square inch of the suit. Soon."

The demonstration is interrupted by the sound of the building's alarm going off. Both students turn; the security lights are blaring their gruesome yellow, and the monitors switch over to display a schematic of where the intrusion was found. "I've gotta take this," he says quickly, bolting for the door and grabbing his helmet along the way. Behind him, Chris watches the animated displays shift and turn. She watches a pack of armed and armored men entering through a blown door. Their automatic energy rifles are familiar: she remembers seeing similar weapons used in footage from an assault on a police station so many weeks ago, and she remembers what they are capable of. _I have to warn him,_ she thinks to herself, and with determination she too rushes out.

---

(( DarkGlow! Clarity! Please! )) The Ghost's telepathic 'voice' comes over Ming's subtle bridge of mind to mind, a cry of urgency that stabs through the former silence. Never has he sounded this agitated. (( Yamaguchi Building at 1651 Douglas Avenue! There can be no delay! ))

Ming is just pulling off her earrings as she hears the call. (( Ghost Knight, what is going on? )) She sounds oddly unsurprised by the call. She already is slipping out her blouse and turning to get into her body armor.

(( No time! )) he calls back sharply. (( There is only a minute or so left! ))

DarkGlow opens his eyes and regards the form sitting across from him. Her eyes are closed, but he has no way of knowing if she is keeping her thoughts still while performing the simple exercises he has given her. _Simple, my ass. Took me bloody forever to master those 'simple' exercises. 'Course I was by myself, and groping my way along more blindly than anything else..._ He smiles a bit, watching her seated calmly, meditating properly or no. _At least she's here--except I've gotta go. 'S funny; if I hadn't been meditating, I'd probably be pretty upset at the interruption. Great timing, GK..._

DarkGlow tells her he has to go. "I suppose it's too much to expect you to continue with me gone, but please at least remain there until I leave, all right?" She doesn't answer. Ironically, that's exactly what she's supposed to do, but it does nothing to sooth his thoughts. His cloak settles into place as he swings it over his shoulders. "Well, I should be back soon." Still nothing. With an expression somewhere between an amused smile and a worried frown, he steps into shadow.

(( There's no way I can get there that fast. )) Clarity sounds rather annoyed and impatient, this time. Unlike her to get ruffled over things. Except her own shortcomings, which is how she views this situation.

DarkGlow pauses in a deserted alleyway somewhere between his apartment and the Yamaguichi building. (( Just teleport. If you can't get there in one leap, take smaller steps. Still gonna be faster than a taxi. ))

(( ... )) Ming sends no words at first, but the sense of great impatience spills across the link. (( Since when can I teleport at all? Are you drunk or something? ))

(( GET HERE! )) The magnitude of importance strikes through the impending conversation. (( DARKGLOW, DON'T FUCKING DELAY. GET HER AND COME! ))

(( You can't teleport? Oh. I thought with the telepathy and all... Um. Well, give me a minute... )) Brows drawn into an expression of worry, DarkGlow reorients himself and heads towards Ming's home. _And I'm supposed to do what exactly? Just pick her up bodily and go? Will that even work? What happens if I drop her?_

Clarity grows so aggitated by the situation that she forgets to filter everything. The image of her glaring at a mirror, tapping her foot impatience is clear. (( I'm so useless for these fast things! ))

DarkGlow emerges into a corner of her apartment. He shakes his head to clear that last image from his mind. "Not so loud, would you?" he says aloud.

Ming spins around, rather taken aback. "Right. Let's do this." She rushes over to DarkGlow, looks him over, and without much thought, just grabs hold for dear life. (( I hope this works. ))

"You're telling me?" DarkGlow asks rhetorically. "Umm, let's see..." He looks between the samll form of Clarity and the shadow in the corner. _Well, if I just hold onto her, right? She's not really that big. Just like a big backpack or something..._ "Err... excuse me for a second..." He lifts her bodily. With the black of his costume and the white of hers, he's reminded absurdly of a groom and a bride. "Lovely," he mutters. "This's hardly the threshold they're referring to."

"Threshold?" murmurs Clarity. "Just what is it in your head this time? Don't get any funny ideas, just cause my sister thinks you are my boyfriend. And teases me all the time about it, I might add."

DarkGlow shakes his head impatiently. "Look, I dunno if I should tell you to hold your breath, or close your eyes, or that it's going to be cold, or whatnot. I have no idea. It's shadow. I like it and it likes me. You, I don't know. It doesn't either. At least I don't think so. Anyway, just... don't do anything stupid," he finishes lamely. He feels her trembling in his arms. Or is it his arms that are trembling? Either way, he tries forgetting the sensation and tries to concentrate on the shadow as hard as he can. _Short hop, maybe. But does it..?_ He shakes his head again. _Quit stalling? If we both end up dead or something, least I'll have the satisfaction of really pissing off Ghost Knight..._ He steps forward.

A short while later they arrive on scene. DarkGlow lowers her delicately to the ground, and gingerly rubs his temples. "That was odd. I think I should practice that more." He looks around, and focuses on the situation. "Later, I mean. Let's go."

The loading bay is open to the alley behind the street. The giant shuttered door that normally admits cargo to and from the trucks that pull up has been blasted open by some kind of high-energy weapon. Inside, five armored bodies lay in a state of unconsciousness. Two steel maces are discarded on the floor. Several long-barreled weapons of a type used by the New Purple Gang in previous encounters lie beside the bodies, or smashed and broken. The whole place has been shot up, and even now a few scattered fires are burning on the crates stacked in sections of the bay.

At the center of the room is Thomas, Lydon's 'technology integrator' and associate of the Ghost Knight. Except that he's wearing the black armor himself, with the white skull-mask laying on the ground beside him. Laying in front of him is a girl, badly wounded, burnt and dying from the rattling sound of her breath. Tom turns as the two arrive, revealing tear-streaked eyes and a reddened face, and whispers, "She's almost gone.. I can't get through her aura, professor.. help me save her.."

The normal manner of Ming's mind link is gentle, careful, and cautious. Her withdrawal this time is more like a having some one yank duct tape directly off one's brain. She bends her mind to draw the girl into the link, and at the same time back to Ghost Knight, the speed of it like a cracking whip to him, but gentle as a caress to the fallen girl. (( I'm here. ))

The link works just as it had with Clarity's sister, in what seems like another lifetime to the telepath. Though she is just a conduit for this, it requires her attention. The link that connects to the fallen girl slips and Clarity finds holding it no easier than grabbing an eel out of the water. Still, the work is accomplished, wounds close, vessels are reconstructed, clots formed, then undone when the torn flesh is smoothed once more.

Thomas slumps over as he withdraws his hands, shutting his eyes and shaking his head. "She had seconds more," he whispers to himself, like some kind of mantra. "Seconds more.." Carefully he slides his hands underneath the girl's body, lifting her up. The young woman is still out; she looks the same age as Tom, now that her injuries have been repaired for the most part. He tries to rise on shaky knees, but doesn't quite make it the first time.

Ming steps back for a moment, then moves to try and help Ghost Knight to his feet. "Are you alright? Why were they here?" And if she gets one name from them she'll tear all their minds completely apart until she's satisfied.

DarkGlow realizes in a moment of perfect helplessness that with as much damage and injury has he has inflicted over the last years, he has never--never--needed to actually assist someone. _Not that I think CPR is gonna do much in this case._ His face is invisible under his hood, but his eyes are more solemn than perhaps they have ever been as he regards Clarity, and witnesses her actions. _My head still feels funny, somehow I don't think that matters terribly much. Guess I was of some use, even if not what I expected._ Still feeling helpless--if not completely useless--he turns away from the scene. Over his shoulder he says, "I'll patrol." and vanishes back into shadow.

Thomas looks at Ming, finding his voice as DarkGlow vanishes. (( You guys got here, you saved her life, )) he transmits. (( They won't be back. Please, please, come with me to the hospital.. )) With effort he stands, and starts walking unsteadily toward the gap in the door.

Clarity nods to Ghost Knight, looking over her armor. (( If this won't cause trouble, I want to come with you. I just don't want to cause her problems in the aftermath of this. This isn't a time to worry about that, anyway. Let's go. ))

DarkGlow pauses in surveying the scene from his first chosen lookout. He has seen nothing anyway. He wants to refuse Ghost Knights broken request more than anything at the moment. _I'm not used to being useless._ The calmness from his earlier meditaion has all but deserted him. _Still..._ (( As you wish--but only because you wish it. ))

(( I couldn't heal Chris without Ming. Ming couldn't have arrived without you. I want you both with me, because I need people around, )) replies Thomas, quietly. Unsteadily he starts walking, regaining his accustomed strength and surety with each step.

Clarity follows in silence, her thoughts drifting to the uncnocious men. (( The proper security team should take care of them. If they are lucky, they will all be shot before I get my mind on them. ))

Back near the others, DarkGlow kneels briefly and retrieves something. He hurries to catch up with Ghost Knight. "You'll be wanting to don this," he says, proffering the mask. "Or to remove the rest of the armour. You probably don't care much now, but you will later."

"Thanks," mumbles Thomas, accepting the gesture. "Fuck.."

---

The hospital is well lit most hours; even during the late shift, there's people ready to accept an in-patient. Tom, having ditched most of his armor outside, seems to be wearing little more than a black pair of pants, boots, and a white tank-top. Fortunately he has his Yamaguchi ID with him. Now he sits, leaning back in a chair in the hall opposite the examination room.

Ming sits by Thomas, looking rather uncertain of herself. She didn't take the time to put much on under her armor, so she's sitting in the waiting room in a pair of shorts and something she hopes looks like a tank top. (( In the future I'm going to figure out some way to get there faster.. ))

Tom breaks his silence at last. "So they're going to call her parents now," he says. "And they're going to wonder what she was doing there. And they're probably going to try and sue someone. Probably Lydon. And then people will wonder why **I** was there. And wonder what GK was doing there.." He crystallizes this litany of woe into a single, coherent conclusion: "Fuck."

A short distance up the hallway, DarkGlow is holding the police at bay. _Be easier if I could just strangle them..._ "Look, this is the last time. There was an assault on a Yamaguchi facility. Yamaguchi's security forces--namely Team Tengu--held them at bay. The kid is a Yamaguichi employee, giving his girlfriend a tour or something. The other one is a professor, also on tour. Just the wrong place at the wrong time. The rest of the team is chasing down the rest of the attackers, I accompanied them here, just in case they were targeted or something. That's it. Yamaguchi will hand over any security tapes or whatnot in the morning." He makes a shooing gesture. "That's all. I'll continue to guard the people here. You can go. Oh--and if the media show up here to start taking pictures or anything, I'll be very annoyed. It's best if that doesn't happen." _If the light wasn't so damn bright, I'd put up a wall of shadow to seal off the corridor. Guess I'll just stand here and look menacing._

(( If push comes to shove, I'll find a way to rewire some minds and get this figured out for us. And I don't think they'll sue Lydon. It wasn't his fault that someone attacked his building. I just wonder what they were after. They had to know we'd come after them. )) She sighs and fidgets. (( You think the press is going to come? That would be really bad. ))

Thomas shrugs a little, as he stays hunched over in his seat. "She should be okay," he says, almost to himself, though really to whoever's listening. "She should be okay." He stirs himself, looking over at Ming, down the hall to DarkGlow. (( If it's trouble for you guys to be around me, don't worry about it. ))

DarkGlow stands there until the police retreat, muttering. _As long as that's all they do._ He glances back over his shoulder. (( Eh, Lydon can whip up tapes showing anything we bloody well want. Don't worry about that--that's what a team is for, right? )) _Yeah, like you'd know. Sounded good, though._

(( It's kinda too late, now. I think someone recognized me at the receptionist's desk. This is a hospital, they read my papers all the time, you know. )) She quirks her lips, looking over at a male nurse who has been looking at her for a while. (( That one either knows who I am, or ought to find something to do besides ogle. ))

The hospital is hustling and bustling, even at this hour, though the ER is surprisingly quiet. Finally, a man in a coat pushes through the doors, a tired, worn expression contrasting with the stylized N on the green shirt, a replica of a Superhero's torso. The shirt is a clear indication of his youth's impression on that bedside manner, evident in the smile warmed only by coffee and compassion. "Mr Temple?"

Thomas looks up, rubbing his eyes a little bit and shaking off sleep. "Yeah?" he asks, his voice dry and husky.

"Okay, Ms Green? She's awake. She's a little incoherent from the drugs. She's fine. The tissue was a little raw - there were no injuries, but she was still a little..." He grasps for a word. "Shell shocked. We also had to remove some burnt skin, even if the skin beneath was perfect." He doesn't even sound like **he** believes such is possible. "I'd still like to keep her for over night observation, but she is safe to go."

Tom digests this for several seconds. At last he nods. "Alright, thanks." He buries his head in his hands, mumbling to himself. The only discernible word is "fuck", but at least he seems more relaxed now.

The doctor gives a weak smile, adding after a moment "She's up for visiting if you're up for it, Mr Temple."

(( Guys? Come on in with me. I want her to be able to thank you properly, )) sends Tom as he rises. "Alright."

Ming rises with Tom, patting his shoulder consoling. "I'm sure she'll be alright. We just need to give her a little time."

The doctor points. "Right through there, turn left, third bed on the right."

DarkGlow turns at the doctor's words. _Uh, team spokesman. I should probably explain. Umm... the truth would probably work._ He walks over. "One of my teammates, Clarity, mostly healed them with her powers. I brought them here for observation, as you say--not for surgery. Thank you for confirming Clarity's work." He squeezes the doctor's shoulder in what he hopes is a friendly way.

The orthodox healer just gives DarkGlow a nod. "We could use her around here, then. What I'd give to have that kind of gift... But I have another patient to get to. Really nasty stomach virus going around." With that, he disappears down the hall. It's not too difficult to find Chris, who's curtained off from the rest of the room. She's wearing a hospital gown and a blanket, IVs and the standard things sticking to and from her. "Tommy," She announces lucidly.

"I brought a couple people," says Tom, smiling. "You wouldn't be here without them." He nods behind him. "Glad to see you are okay."

"My parents?" She sits up, blinking. "I'm glad to see I'm okay too..."

Thomas shakes his head slowly. "No, no..." He steps aside, to let his teammates introduce themselves - if they do at all.

Ming shakes her head. "Not exactly," she replies. She moves to the bed, reaching out to take on of Chris' hands. "Sorry we weren't there earlier," she says softly.

"That's okay." Chris pats the back of Ming's hand - or tries to, but her IV doesn't give much slack, caught on the bed side railing. "Don't I know you? You're... a teacher. Tom's?"

"Among other things, yes. You probably haven't seen me in quite so informal an outfit," answers Ming. "But we've talked before. Hmm, I don't think you hit your head.." Ming projects carefully to Chris, (( We've spoken like this before, too. ))

Her face lights up. "Oooh. That's right." Ming can tell that the woman's mind is a little clouded. It's actually an interesting experience, seeing the brain work at the effected pace.

DarkGlow bows briefly, and with some aplomb, when Chris' gaze momentarily focuses on him. "Miss," he says formally, by way of greeting. But, other than that, he remains silent by the foot of the bed.

"It's going to be okay," says Tom softly. "You're fine now, they're just checking you over." He falls silent, thinking ahead, thinking how complex this mess can become. And all because of a second's worth of tragedy.

"Don't worry, Tom," says Ming, trying to sound assuring. "I'm sure we can make everything alright." She just might have to work on her ability to literally reshape minds.

Chris's face crinkles up. "But how did they help?"

"Healing you couldn't have been done alone," says Tom, obliquely. "And getting.. everything together wasn't something myself nor Ming could have really done." He sighs, then shows a happier smile. "A team effort."

"Mmm." Chris lays her head back, and lifts a free hand to rub her face. "Well, I am glad you all were there. Or got there on time."

"I wouldn't say we got there on time," Ming says quietly. "I'm sorry we were so late. You shouldn't have been hurt at all."

"Ah nah nah." Chris shakes her hand dismissively. "All in the line of duty, or something. The risks I take, and all that."

"Well, you took a risk," says Tom, softly. "But your heart was in the right place. Lucky for both of us it still is," he adds, nodding to the IV drip and other trappings of medicine.

Chris nods, and the gesture only flops her head against the pillow. "Oof. I would say more heartfelt things, Tom, Ming, dark broody guy in the corner, but I'm all blah and can't think. And sleepy."

Ming falls silent, drawing herself inward to try and figure out how to prevent this from ever happening again. With her, if there is a bad outcome, she did something wrong.

"It's time for us to leave," whispers Thomas, patting Chris on the shoulder as lightly as possible. Nodding to his teammates, he begins filing out of the room, a great weight lifted from his heart.

Ming rises and nods to Chris, patting her hand. (( Don't worry, we will not be far. )) Her assurance is gentle, and she manages to carefully screen out any emotions that might have slipped along the link. She's clearly back in control of that, at least.
