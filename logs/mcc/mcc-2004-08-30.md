The silent auction moments from ending, Guy briefly connects to Black Thought and the Ghost Knight, reading over all of the names for the most lethal and dangerous of the items. The field is narrowed down to six: A fusion powered submarine with moderate defenses and warheads, a fully operational orbital satellite with various useful functions, a disintegration weapon, a local - but powerful - earthquake initiating explosive, six gun turret/sniper automations, and an aquatic "base".

_Heh. They're like kids in a candy store._ Guy meanders around the silent auction for a while, making a silent observation as to who is in the lead for what. _Of course, when we're done, we'll have to get rid of most of this stuff, but... I want that satellite._ The detective notes the price, makes a few guesses, and writes his name down on the card, along with his bid.

The final bell rings. All of the auction lists are collected, and everyone is shooed from the room. In the grand ballroom, the winners are announced, and asked to enter an adjacent room. There inside is Sinistra, sitting primly, waiting for everyone to take their seats. "Thank you all for buying everything. Now, let's get to business. Honestly, very few of us here are up to giving mailing addresses. Security is a necessary precaution. For certain items, books and manuals, you can pick those up with me in an hour. For the car, and other legal items, your cash can be accepted tonight, and you can be told where they can be picked up in three days. As for the twenty more interesting items..."

"The top twenty sellers will be given a code, and an e-mail address. You have one week to prepare. After that week's up, you must commit a crime. Near your home turf, or what have you. Rob a bank, or something less crass, like the kidnapping of a politician, the theft of a national landmark, ah..." She thinks, waving her hand dismissive. "Be creative. We will be watching the news. When it's done, send your code to the e-mail address, with references to the news sites as to which you did. Once this is received, we will send you a rendezvous point."

There are some mutterings among the crowd. Some who are less computer savvy aren't too pleased about it, while others, always the showoff for the media, are all too eager. Everyone files out but the top twenty sellers, who approach to receive their code and address. From there, Sinistra leaves them to their own devices.

Using their combined means, the group has learned the time, and location of the Will reading. Tracking Sinistra up to a hotel room, the Ghost Knight listens in on the reading. Nothing of real importance - sentimentals, money, estate - are rattled off. However, three things leap out: a device able to manipulate magnetism, a villa/underground facility in Italy, and a mechanical up-right tank, or mecha. However, no means of contacting or meeting to deliver the goods are shared. All the participants vacate the room.

Sinistra leaves the will reading, and heads upstairs to have a word with two or three people, all under an unseen ear. Most of it is pleasantries, old friends or respectful adversaries. One was at the will reading itself, and Sinistra mentions she will give the individual a call when the caddy can be shipped. Then, she finally makes it to her bedroom, to fall tiredly atop her bed.

Like a phantom, Tom Temple enters the hotel room Sinistra occupies. His powers suppress the slightest squeak of the floor, the merest hint of his breathing, even the rustles of kevlar and composite his suit might make. While his quarry sleeps, the Ghost Knight devotes most of his attention to the jewelry and accessories she removed, while keeping an eye out for activity from her. With his mastery of matter he begins inserting radio-frequency tracking devices and listening devices into her earrings, ring and watch. This done, he exits as quietly as he came in.

---

In an unused basement storage room at the hotel, the four benevolent conspirators are gathered together to report on their successes, their uncertainties, and the plans for the immediate future. Upon arriving, Tom informs everyone about the listening devices and bugs he's planted.

Clarity nods to Thomas, "Nice bit of work there. Hopefully she'll lead us right to everything, then. We still may have to spoof a crime, but I'm thinking we know someone who would be more than willing to help, right?" She nods to herself, "We'll pull this whole mess off yet."

DarkGlow stands quietly against a wall, unenthusiastically resisting the urge to fade into invisiblity. _I should be home. This is going to turn out badly..._ He shoots a scowl at the ceiling. _I still don't know if I should cozy up to dragon dude, or bump him off._ He sighs quietly.

Guy plays with the card bestowed upon him by Sparks. "One week? That doesn't give us a lot of time." Turning to Clarity, "That sax player, he wants to rub out Blitzkrieg, a friend of Ghost Knight." The detective tosses up the card, and slows its' fall to a crawl, tapping his fingers over it. "I'll have to handle that, I guess..."

DarkGlow chuckles softly. "You sound even more depressed than I feel..."

**He's not precisely a friend,** clarifies GK. **I suffocated him in front of a large audience.**

"You really have to work on those people skills, Ghostknight," says Clarity. "Anyway, a week will have to do. With our tech help we should be able to pull it off, right? It's not like we've got a great deal of alternatives here. We'll just have to put in some overtime."

DarkGlow shakes his head. "We can rest when we're dead, is that it?" His tone isn't morose, per se, but it's hardly cheery either.

**There is nothing more important, at this stage,** concurs the Ghost. **These things must be kept out of the wrong hands.**

GK continues. **Sinistra is being 'tapped' - we should be alerted to any contact she makes with the recipients of the will, presuming she wears any of her accessories while speaking with them, and if she leaves without them, we will at least know that much. The contacts for the auction will be made by e-mail, apparently, which gives us some time. Shawntae will need to intercept messages sent via that means, and we apparently have a crime to commit if Guy is to receive what he bid on.**

"That should suffice," agrees Clarity. "As for the crime, I think we can stage something that looks real enough. Perhaps I should make some contacts among law enforcement so we can act it out properly? I can also provide some rather potent illusions to influence reporters."

"Wait a minute." Guy's detective mind starts putting one and two together. "Okay. We, er, I should help out Blitzkrieg, I mean, someone's wanting to kill him. We need to fake a crime. And, we have a short time, that's going to overlap. What if we used Blitzkrieg to spoof our caper?"

_Illusions? Hmmm... Probably more trouble than the real thing, though it's just the sort of thing that Ming would suggest--which means it's probably just the sort of thing a hero-type should do._ DarkGlow ponders reflectively, then mentally reviews what Guy just said. "You mean kill him ourselves? I, uh, don't really think we should do that. Or did you mean just steal the assassin's kill?" _Gee, could I have put that any worse?_ "Or... uh, save him and make it _look_ like he was killed...?" _Better, but you're sitll a twit..._

**Make it look like he was killed, while he lays low for awhile - at least until the end of this matter,** says GK.

"We are of course going to save him," says Clarity. She gives Dark Glow a curious look and grins. "Since you are interested in it, maybe you should take the key role in the plan?"

_Yup. Really shoulda thought of that first..._ DarkGlow mentally kicks himself again.

"Right. We fake his death by pretending to kill him." Guy ponders a moment. "Maybe we can involve stealing a national monument somehow. Just 'cause that would make us seem like a much cooler bunch of, y'know, villains." _I always wanted to say that._

DarkGlow looks askance at Clarity. "Sure," he says warily. "Why not? What did you have in mind?"

"The Lincoln Memo-oh wait... you meant what was your role gonna be," replies Guy, who looks a bit red-faced for a moment.

Clarity considers Dark Glow for a while and frowns in thought. "Well, you do have the most expertise in this area, don't you? We just need to have a reasonable intelligent excuse for this to happen. Perhaps a botched robbery of some kind? Blitzkrieg shows up, you do your thing, I spawn a few illusions. Dead man and news story all in one."

DarkGlow frowns in an expression of confusion. "Expertise in this area? I shouldn't think so. I mean, I only just learned to take someone with me into shadow, and I've never tried making anyone else invisible along with myself. I can wrap people up, sure, but it's not like I can do much else. I suppose I could wrap him up and lift him away with a shadow arm, but I think that'd look more like a lame attempt at kidnapping than anything else."

"Just to remind you guys, we'll be having some uh... competition here, in a manner of speakin'," informs Guy. "Sparks is gathering a gang together to do this hit, so uh, he'll likely want to get a piece of the ol' action. Teleporting him away might not quite work... unless..."

Guy asks, "Can any of you manipulate instruments to make it look like there's a space_time anomaly_wipe someone from someone's memory?"

"I think I can find a way to remove someone from memory," says Clarity. "It won't be easy, of course. But it's all quite possible." She laughs suddenly and looks to Dark Glow, "After all, I'm an expert, too."

"I was just thinking... we could pretend to invent a bomb that will totally obliterate someone from the space/time continuum. And either make it look like they've never existed, or uhm, that they've uh, been totally obliterated y'know," adds Guy. "I saw something like this on Star Trek once."

DarkGlow is skeptical. "At faking a murder? Sure, I can see how that'd be a useful skill for a scientist..."

Clarity raises an eyebrow at Dark Glow. "I mean I'm an expert in areas of the mind, of course. Faking murders has just never been that useful in the lab before, you see. Though it'd be fun at parties."

_Parties...?_ Confused, DarkGlow wracks his brain for a reference. "You mean like... dinner theatre?"

"Dinner theatre... now THERE'S an idea." Guy strokes his chin thoughtfully, "We could make the whole thing happen at a dinner theatre. That gives you guys an excuse to help get rid of the body... you'd be perfect..."

The team breaks their planning session. Guy has a devilishly amused expression on his face. _Dinner theatre..._ He'll spend a day or two pondering his plan, and when the time is right, he takes the card he'd been given and calls up Sparks. "Yeah... I think I can help ya out..."

The man on the other end of the phone can't be seen, but his distinctive voice is unmistakeable. "Keep talkin'"

"Well, I've got an idea. A way to take care of that weed problem in your garden, you know the fast growing one? I've hit on something that'll totally wipe 'em out," replies Guy. "Where can we talk?"

"Monday," says Sparks, that gravely voice sounding more reassured. "Chicago. Little place called Cain's Crime. Ask around, 'cause it ain't in the big yellow book."

"Sure thing. See ya there." Guy chuckles. "Hey, you like dinner theatre?"

"Not unless it's tasteful," comes Sparks' voice. "Got somethin in mind?"

"Maybe. We'll see what's what when I get to town," replies Guy. "Anyway, we're talking for too long. Gotta go."
