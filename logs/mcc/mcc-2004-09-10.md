# Millennium City Chronicles 2004-09-10

An emergency call comes over the police band: a fire, in a large apartment complex to the south of downtown Millennium City. An explosion in the Loop is interfering with emergency response, and the turbo-response units are already in the air to respond to possible terrorist involvement. Conventional rescue will take time to arrive.

Ming is at home, curled up and reading a book. Her sister just went to bed, happy as can be. They actually got to spend an entire day together. Which meant a lot of shopping was done and serious topics were discussed. Mostly boys, clothes, and memories of their parents.

Her scanner has been configured to alert her if important alerts come in. What is happening to the south definitely qualifies. This is actually a new part of her old hero tracking system, upgraded about a thousandfold thanks to Shawntae. Her first reaction is to rise and grab one of the teams more mundane communication devices. Even as she's getting dressed to go she calls out, "Anyone available to help me with a problem?"

"Just me," comes back the voice of Shawntae. "And I'm taking a break right now. But uh, I think GK is available. He said he would be coming by the lab in an hour."

"I think I'll have to speed that up," says Ming. "You keeping an eye on the scanners?" She finishes putting on her costume, then makes herself invisible as she moves to the window. "We have to move quickly. I hope he understands the need to intrude.." (( Thomas, I hope I'm not interupting anything important.. )) And before he can be upset with her intrusion, she will give him the full update, assuming he doesn't already know of what is happening.

(( Sounds bad, )) Tom replies mentally. (( Just a moment... )) His mental 'presence' returns a few seconds later. (( Chemistry pop quiz. Done in 48 seconds. I'll meet you there. ))

Ming nods and smiles. (( That's my star student! )) She stares out her window, glad that it faces to the south. One moment she is there, the next she is perched far above the blaze on another tall building, surveying the damages. This information is immediately fed to Thomas along the link. (( What a mess. ))

The apartment complex is a shambles. One of the "new-style" high-rise apartments, it exemplifies the "Neo-Modern" architecture popular in some parts of the high-tech Millennium City. Unfortunately even the rudimentary safety systems built into it aren't enough. A fire is spreading through the upper eight floors of the fourteen-floor structure. It seems to have started on the western side of the rectangular building, for there are a number of burst windows there and the blackened char on the outside walls is already starting to form from the heat. While panicked citizens mill about on the ground level, a number of bucket brigades have been formed.

"Time to get to work, Clarity," she murmurs to herself. (( I think my best thing is to figure out how many people are in there, and where they are. Just a moment, please. )) Dropping her invisibility, Clarity sends a powerful mind scan against the burning complex.

A number of people are still trapped inside, it turns out. There are several people in the upper hallways who can't reach the fire escape because of a collapsed support beam, and the elevators are being avoided by anyone with even a shred of sense. A tsunami of panicked thought washes over Clarity as she seeks the minds waiting within. All are gripped with fear.

Everything Clarity learns is passed on to Thomas, but she doesn't just wait. These people need her, and need her now. Something of a bit of faith is required for her next move. The fires hold most of what she can see, and everything might be dangerous. The one place she knows is safe is the fire escape that the panicked people cannot reach, and so she is on the building one moment, on that rather precarious perch the next. Instantly the heat of the fire washes over her, but fortunately the fumes of it are being carried elsewhere by the wind. (( I'm going in. ))

(( I'll join you. )) The voice comes as a black shape breaches the ground at high speed outside the complex. The Ghost Knight, his cloak flapping rapidly, would slam into the side of the apartment wall but for his control. Instead he merely lands, hands and feet out, clinging to the wall beside his teammate like an unnatural black spider. **I will extinguish the fire as we move. But only you have the power to extinguish their fear.**

(( I will do my best. )) Clarity is cautious to test the knob before she enters the building. With a grim expression she swings it open and moves inside. (( There's a support beam down in here. I'll get past it and start calming them right away. )) She thinks the proper mental illusion should work wonders, there.

Even the knob is hot, and it will not yield to bare flesh without causing great pain. Nevertheless this is little obstacle for the pair, and with GK ahead of her, Clarity begins her life-saving work. The raging inferno beyond the door quells itself after the Ghost Knight stretches out a hand, but nearby fires will quickly replace it unless also subdued. GK can do little more than drive away smoke and form a safe path for now. **I can feel them too,** he reports. **We will guide each other.**

Clarity nods, her mind stretching out ahead like a feeler, sensing the proximity of the trapped survivors. She uses that same mind scan to force a telepathic contact with one of the more lucid people. (( Stay where you are. Help is coming. ))

The forced touch causes confusion at first, but Clarity's message is repeated enough to be understood. The other survivors are in a panic, though, and only with several more exhausting scans and the use of mind control is there any calming the lot of them. Finally the group is drawn back together, sitting anxiously in a hall while all around them the sounds of the hungry fire can be heard.

With the use of Ghost Knight's powers over matter the two heroes get ever closer, finally reaching the fallen support beam. As Ghost Knight sets to work on moving that formidible obstacle, Clarity staggers at his side, spending more and more of her energy on touching other minds, trying to draw them into pockets of momentary safety, all the while guided by what the Ghost Knight can sense about the current state of the building.

Clarity's contacts are repeated in many minds. The most difficult for her is that of two children, separated from their mother. (( There is no need to be afraid. Go out the front door and down the hall. Go through the door and down the stairs outside. Good men will be waiting for you there. )) And Clarity sees to that, reaching out to touch the minds of what rescue workers have arrived on the scene. (( There will be two children exitting on the southwest fire escape. Please pick them up quickly. ))

**Something's amiss,** reports the Ghost, grunting for a moment with the effort of keeping three floors from collapsing at once, repairing their weakened supports with his powers as he tries simultaneously to focus on his uncanny sense. **A large black zone, two floors up. Larger than any person.**

(( A black zone? )) asks Clarity. (( Where is it and what would cause it? )) She is stil reaching out her mind, guiding those who are near exits down what safe paths exist. The largest collection of people still lies ahead, though. (( If I can just see to where they are I can get them out of here.. just need a window and a few seconds. ))

The Ghost gives up his repairing efforts for a moment, then begins to focus his power. The walls around him in the hallway begin to rattle, then finally everything seems to explode at once. A chunk of the apartment outer wall is demolished as though struck by a wrecking ball, and at the same time two other walls are similarly destroyed in place. The fires rise up for a moment, seemingly excited by the influx of fresh air - but there is now a clearer path. **There are people above,** states the Ghost. **We must go through the floors directly.**

Clarity nods quickly, reaching out again and again. Even in this mess, she manages to reach the mind of a mother panicked senseless, her children thought lost. (( Officer Maracone has your children. He's across the street, near Danny's, )) sends Clarity, again pushing her way into someone's mind. For a few more minutes, she feels the woman's mixture of panic and hope, than joy and relief at such levels that she has to cut off the contact before it brings her to tears. (( Let's get them out of here. ))

Another mind waits above, as well, that of a crying child huddled in a corner. Around her, in the shadows of her mind, the flames lick ominously closer like malevolent demons waiting to steal her away to some blazing damnation below.

Clarity actually curses under her breath. She's so angry at the thought of the fire claiming a life. More angry because it is a child. She feels the fear, and answers it with directed fury, forcing her mind to truly accept everything it sees in the child's eyes. Forcing herself to utterly believe everything Thomas senses, as well. Using these things, she makes a leap of faith, suddenly vanishing, only to appear in the roaring heat of the fire that surrounds the child. Feeling herself burning up she moves by instinct, casting herself at the cornered child and again teleporting, this time drawing the child with her. This time, the surrender is easier, but when she reappears by the Ghost Knight, she is stained with the blackness of the fire and almost overcome by fumes, her skin burned, but she does cling to conciousness yet.

A sudden explosion rocks the building; jets of flame burst through the half-open doors of nearby apartments, as though greeting the teleporter with anger at stealing away their prize. Ming and the Ghost Knight are surrounded in scant seconds by an inferno, and the air becomes hotter and more difficult to breathe with each passing second. **It's all black now!** calls GK, worriedly. **I can't see anything!**

Clairty doesn't have to see. At least not with her eyes. She reaches out almost blindly, grabbing a hold of Ghost Knight. One moment they are lost in blackness, the next they are in cool air, not far from the paramedics. The strain is too great for Clarity to do her normal teleportation tricks, and so she remains as she was, lying on the ground. The stunned child is still clutched protectively, as if Clarity isn't sure just where she is.

"Please help me," whispers the girl, clutching tightly. "They are coming for me.." And as if on cue, the grass near the place the two heroes stand lights up of its own accord. A shock passes through a few of the onlookers - one surprising arrival was bad enough, but the sudden emergence of fire here is overwhelming. The flames begin to lick along the grass, claiming the base of a tree.

Clarity is barely able to register what is happening, but she does manage to do what she should, pushing a telepathic contact into the girl's mind. (( You are safe.. we won't let anyone get you. You must relax. You are safe. )) Clarity continues to drone her voice soothingly in the girl's mind. She tries to whisper it, but winds up simply coughing more.

The girl's mind is nearly drowning in fiery imagery, although a little bit of it has retreated. She is paralyzed by the flickering torches that dance in her mind, and each newly-kindled fire has an analogue in the area around the two supers.

And in her thoughts, a black cloud and a white glow appear, both immune from the fires around them. Nevertheless, the persistent fire-demons reach their scorching fingers at the pair, drawing closer to consummating the inferno they seem to desire.

Clarity uses still more of her strength, though she wonders where it comes from. Her gentle grasp grows stronger yet, and her will presses against the mind of the child, finally entering where it might do battle with those fires, swallowing them with the soothing cool of flowing waters. Again and again they would dodge her, try to scorch this water that comes from nowhere, but they cannot escape her, as her control steadily improves.

"Don't hurt me.. please don't hurt me," whimpers the child, clutching fiercely at her protector. Nevertheless Ming can tell that she is not the target of the girl's teary pleas. It is the fire itself that rages in her mind, seeking release. Clarity can feel her temperature rising, and even the Ghost Knight seems conscious of what's about to happen. "I can't put this out," whispers Tom, sounding - for one of the few times in his career - powerless.

Clarity growls and drops the link, drops everything else. The force she throws against the fires is everything she has. It is not water or ice that they contend with now, but something stronger, harder than diamonds, colder than the deepest void of space. Fires are not extinguished, but are frozen solid, there is nowhere for them to flee. Everything but the mind of the child is hammered in one blow of absolute control, and then again, shattering the fires into the aether, so that nothing is left at all.

And in that black void, all that remains is a little girl, crying uncontrollably over a grave. Images, pictures, fragmentary sights and sounds and other things. The smells are always of fire - mom cooking, dad doing BBQ over the balcony grill, the fireplace that burned at grandma's house before she died, the sweet smell of s'mores with friends from school, roasting over a pit fire. And dad, disappearing into a wall of orange-white as smoke billowed out from the old house.

"Stop...stop..." The girl's cries are slowly subsiding as her weakened condition begins to take its toll on her. She coughs a few times, as her lungs seek to expel the foreign smoke that's invaded her body. The demons have gone now, and with them the fires that surrounded the pair and were smoldering on the grass are extinguished with a wave of Tom's gloved hand.

Clarity just holds the child, trying to shush her with soft words that come out as croaks. "It's stopped," she whispers. She strokes the child's hair, ignoring the burns that have in many places melded skin and armor. "You are going to be okay. You aren't alone. They can't touch you now."

A bit of coughing and choking follows, but the girl seems sound asleep. And beside Clarity, the Ghost Knight resumes his accustomed persona. **The paramedics will be here soon. We have more lives to save, but.. you are in no condition to go.**

(( I know, )) admits Clarity. If, if you can get people together and need me, I can still teleport, I think. I just need to catch my breath first. I'll just rest here.. )) And her head falls back on the ground, her eyes drifting shut. (( Rest.. rest would be good. ))

---

Clarity is awake. She can feel an echo of the burns scalding her body, but there is no pain and no shock. The link held, even while unconscious, and Tom's power could be exerted to the fullest. She finds herself laying on a gurney. Nearby, a small army of ambulances and fire trucks have been deployed. Standing over the gurney is the Ghost Knight, his skull blackened by soot. And behind him, a group of four policemen with pistols drawn and aimed at him. He seems unconcerned. **You are awake. There is work to be done.** "You're not going anywhere!" retorts one of the cops. "We got a tip-off that you were responsible, vigilante!"

Clarity nods at Ghost Knight. (( Is the child alright? )) she asks. She can tell that she is. (( Thanks for saving me, by the way.. )) The police she frowns at behind her mask. (( Figures. Should we just get out of here, or should I make them see the truth? ))

(( She is. In fact... )) The Ghost turns, as a new voice enters the scene. "Stand down, officers!" it barks, with a tone of command, and the hostile cops reluctantly holster their pieces. Arriving is the fire chief, and with him is a woman whose tear-streaked cheeks are in contrast with her glowing smile. Held tightly in her arms is the little girl Ming rescued from earlier. "This woman told me all about it." The brusque man shoos the cops away, comes over to Clarity's gurney and lays a meaty hand on her shoulder. "You're a hero," he says with gruff pride in his voice. "Now get up, we need the gurney. If you're alright, that is."

Clarity laughs softly, rising with some help. "I'm much better," she says quietly. Thanks to Ghost Knight. She will have to ask him just how badly she was injured later. Even if hearing will make her feel light-headed about how risky that move was. Clarity wishes her mask wasn't so weird about now, but she can't reveal herself. Luckily the touch of her mind is gentle, when she reaches out to the woman and her child. (( I am so happy you are alright. ))

"I'm so sorry," the woman says, clumsily raising her free hand to wipe at her tears. The other hand stays busy supporting her child. "Melissa... that's my daughter... she's always been, well, fascinated by fire. Or afraid of it, I guess. Her father... well, there was an incident.." She's almost babbling, though whether from relief or pent-up desire isn't clear. "She's.. done things.. before, but I never really noticed until now, I never..." The tears start coming again, and the fire chief lowers a weighty arm around her shoulder in comfort for a few moments.

"It's a good thing you got her outta there," he remarks. "Not just to save her life either. The fire was spreading a lot faster than any fire ought to. Now I know why." He nods an aside to the sleeping girl. "With her still in there, things'd have been a lot worse."

Clarity nods and takes a deep breath, just cherishing the feeling of cool air in her lungs. "I think it may be wise for me to talk to her again, when she's recovered. She might need my help to learn to control these things." She turns to the chief, then, "Is there anyone else seriously injured? We may be able to help."

"Yeah, a lot of people." The chief turns to the Ghost. "Hey, I saw what you did for her. You're a real hero too, despite what they say." He moves a hand as though to slap Tom on the shoulder heartily, but a piercing stare from two empty eyesockets halts the motion halfway through. "Ehem, anyway, whatever you guys can do, we sure could use it here." He turns, using his parade-ground voice as a bullhorn and battering ram to clear a path. "MAKE A HOLE!" he bellows, and emergency personnel part like the waters of the Red Sea as he leads the way to more injured.

Clarity turns to survey the injured. Fortunately they are not far from each other. The most serious are done first, and are the most difficult to reach. Deep telepathy is required, but with the help of the Ghost Knight the work of the paramedics truly pays off, as the lives they've managed to sustain throughout a night of doubt and worry are fully restored. Some are repaired better than they were were, as an old man suddenly finds himself able to walk comfortably on knees that were crushed in an accident ten years ago. The work is extremely exhausting, but the reward makes it impossible for Clarity to even consider stopping.

By the time the pair finish, and seek out Melissa and her mother, things seem to have settled down considerably. Several people have been taken to the emergency room for care and treatment in spite of the two healers' efforts. The woman and her daughter are huddled on a bench outside the apartment complex's front door. Melissa has regained consciousness and is sucking slowly and methodically on a lollipop, while her mother is content with a styrofoam cup of coffee. "I don't know how to thank you enough," the woman gushes as she sees the two come closer. "If anything had happened, I don't think I could ever forgive myself.." Melissa stirs from her 'lolli' and looks up. "But momma," she asks in a quiet, plaintive voice. "Where are we gonna sleep tonight?" At this question, Ming and Tom look at each other, then back at the two, and smile.

Clarity laughs softly and thinks she knows just the person who can help solve this problem. Money is good for something, after all. Can't buy happiness, but it can rent a deluxe suite in the best hotel in town. And a limo with a driver. Clarity figures the worst that can happen is to have Lydon demand she pay him back, and what's a few thousand dollars between friends? "Don't worry, I know just the person who would be very happy to help," Clarity says.

---

The next morning's headlines are screamers. APARTMENT FIRE RAGES IN SOUTH END. LOCAL HEROES EXTINGUISH BLAZE. PYROKINETIC RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVASTATION. And of course, Tom is vexed to read: GHOST KNIGHT INVOLVED IN ANOTHER DISASTER. He crumples the paper up and throws it in disgust into the hotel trash. Checking himself once again, he pats the shoulder of the distinguished-looking college professor beside him and smiles. "This way, I think," he says. Leading the way down the poshly-decorated hall, he stops at a door and knocks. It's answered a minute later by Melissa's mother, still wearing a bathrobe even in the afternoon. She looks quite at peace. "We're from Mr. Yamaguchi," says Tom, evenly. "Is this a good time to pay a visit, and find out how everything is going?" The woman nods quickly, stepping aside for the pair to enter.

Ming bows politely, hoping her voice will not be recognized. She tries to change it as Clarity, but she was rather distracted after the fire. She glides into the room confidently, no matter that concern. Melissa is at that moment enjoying a chocolate sundae. An incredibly tasty-looking one, at that. "Wow, now that looks good!" Ming says warmly, smiling at the child.

"I'm Tammy, this is my daughter, Melissa," the woman says by way of introduction, and Tom nods slowly, smiling. He keeps an eye on Ming and her charming young host. Melissa raises her head and smiles. "Hi," she says, then takes another bite of sundae. She seems in high spirits; the terrors of the night before seem to have gone.

Ming asks softly, "Do you mind if I sit with you, Melissa? My name is Ming, and I'm here to make sure you are comfortable and enjoying yourself." When the child says, "okay," Ming sits down across from her, just watching patiently. But secretly she's peeking into Melissa's mind, making sure those fires are not returning. She won't tolerate them, and now she knows what they are and how to destroy them.

"You're warm," says Melissa, out of the blue. "Like that lady last night. But not like that guy. He was cold n' scary. Like colder than ice cream cold." And she takes another bite of sundae as if to prove it. As for her mind and thoughts, they are for the moment clear of disturbing thoughts or images. But there is an aura here, a way of looking at the world through the lens of flame. There is good fire and bad fire, and in Melissa's mind Ming has the good kind in her heart.

Ming smiles, "I try to be warm," she says. "You are warm too." She watches the sundae, considering the other comments of the child. "So you can sense things like that, can you? That is a rare gift," she explains. She knows nothing will really sink-in here, since the sundae is much more interesting than anything else, but that isn't really what is important.

Peering further, Ming can feel an awareness of heat in the child's mind. It's more than just a metaphor for feelings, or memories. As she probes gently inward, she distinguishes the sensation of temperature nearby, well beyond where anyone should be able to feel it. It seems reminiscent of Tom's extraordinary ability to detect matter at a distance, and even subtly similar to Ming's own consciousness of distant minds. No wonder the girl is obsessed with fire - she can't escape it.

Ming rises after a moment, letting the child enjoy her sundae. She says to her, "We're going to be meeting regularly to talk," she says. The child just answers the same, "okay." Ming laughs quietly and turns to Tammy, drawing her and Thomas aside. "Your child is very gifted, first of all. She has very special powers, but they are difficult for her to understand. They change the way she sees the world." Ming explains further, "She can not just create and control fire, but sense heat in ways that normal humans cannot. It seems that no major damage has been sustained, but I would like permission to see the child. I think at first twice a week would be healthy. Either with me or with some associates of mine. She can live a rich, rewarding life, Tammy. I promise you we can help her get there."

The woman seems a little stunned by all this. "I.. Things have been difficult since her father passed away," she says hesitantly. "And we.." She gropes for words, trying to put into speech 'we cannot afford whatever it is you are proposing' without damaging her pride in the process.

Ming has the ability to anticipate that. Even without telepathy. "There is no cost, Tammy. I am associated with Mr. Yamaguchi. There is no need to talk of paying or debt. We have a very personal interest in the well-being of children, and her talents make it important for everyone in the city. In the future, with careful training, she could put fires out, and save lives, just as she was saved."

Tammy's stunned expression remains, but her smile begins to appear, and then widen. "I'm so glad," she whispers. "And I feel like such a fool. She'd always know when I was cooking something, or when it was hot or cold outside, and I never.. all these years I never noticed. I just thought she was special.. but I guess she is.." She reaches up to wipe a stray tear from her eye. "Thank you so much."

---

Two days after the fire, Melissa walks hand-in-hand into a large building, and take the elevator to the fourth floor. In a cozy waiting room filled with toys is a man with no face, but a presence that speaks his smile. Crouching down to eye level, the Doctor extends a hand. "Hello, Melissa," comes the soothing voice. The girl looks onwards, her face bright. "You're warm." His chuckle is a cozy blanket that wraps around Melissa. Gesturing outwards, "Let's chat. But first, choose something to bring with us?" Melissa turns towards the toys, and picks up a framework with beads that slide over wire. Hefting it up on her own, she leads the way into the hall, the Doctor on her heels.

For the next few weeks, Ming and her mentor meet regularly with Melissa and her mother. Mother and daughter move into a new home - a special apartment, crafted of plastics, metals and synthetics, with one goal: non-flammable. The two mentalists are certain that with work and time, Melissa will understand how to stop the flames, then how to shape them. The first step is to understand them. Doing this while letting the girl have a regular life, school and music lessons, is difficult but the prognosis encouraging.

To Ming, this is especially meaningful, having lost both of her parents. Her role is that of constant support. She even has a few sessions at her own apartment, allowing her sister to play with Melissa. Ming has endless patience for children, it seems, and for the first time in a while, feels right inside. To Thomas, she puts it simply. (( This is who I've always wanted to be. I'm finally here. ))
