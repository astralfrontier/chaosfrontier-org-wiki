# Millennium City Chronicles 2004-09-13

The Ghost Knight, seeing his opponent rising, reaches with his powers for a fire extinguisher he senses nearby, flinging it quickly to break it open at the last moment. Unfortunately an iron grip surrounds the cylinder before his powers can take hold, and the being's aura thwarts him.

Herculan extends the extinguisher-gripping hand. Energy surges from his shoulder down the arm to the gauntlet, before a flaring shot streaks across the bridge and shatters the sealed wall holding back the soldiers. The men are surprised to have their passage cleared. "On your feet, and attack."

Another plan develops quickly. Tom reaches out, drawing the ultra-resistant metal to himself, mingling his aura with it, forming the stuff into a super-hard shell and core in which his human form resides. Thus armored in his ultra-tech platemail, and armed with deadly maces of the same material, the Steel Knight awaits his attackers.

Wisely, Herculan waits as the soldiers rush out, fanning in a semi-circle around the Ghost Knight at safe distance from his hands - and aiming away from the main controls. Their machineguns open fire.

The bullets streak passed, evaded by the surprisingly nimble Knight, or harmlessly deflected off of his heavy shell. "Widen the center," orders the alien as he pushes forwards, thrusting all his weight into a solid, open-palmed shove towards the Knight's middle.

With the amazing agility he showed in dodging machine-gun fire, the steel golem leaps over the heads of Herculan and two of his minions, planting his hand for a moment on the ceiling to redirect himself. Now positioned directly between the vital master panel and the bulk of the gunman, he extends two fingers from his grip on a mace, beckoning them to do their worst.

"Halt!" Yells the captain. "Do not fire." He strides sideways, staring at the Knight squarely. Looking over the Golem's shoulder, "You two, activate the weapons' system on the surface, and place the surface bubble into place." Dropping the fire extinguisher, Herculan brings his fists together as a pulse of power ripples up his arms. Both gauntlets erupt in a wave of seering light and electrical surges, assaulting over the Knight's eyes, ears, and causing his suit's radio to flicker.

Behind Ghost Knight, the controls' screens flicker and go into haywire, first static, then a blank, blue screen. The radio crackles into silence, before the controls simply power down.

Herculan hisses. "Use the back up controls to initate the system once more. I want his friends above to not interfere." Seeing it prudent to get the Knight out of the way, he strides over, a foot away, and stands still, blocking GK's view as the men scurry to do as he says. One opens a heavily fortified panel, flicking switches, before the machines around the room boot back up. Two other soldiers take positions at stations, while the other four take up a flanking position, waiting for the Ghost to make a wrong move.

The Steel Knight abruptly disappears - downward, leaving only a few scraps of metal behind. And moments later he's reappeared, his metal body rising opposite the man on the backup controls. The flashing silver-gray of his weapons strikes the unfortunate rapidly and forcibly; the man crumples over the controls, and the Ghost is already taking up a defensive pose.

The alien puckers his lips, a vein looking to pound just above his eyes. A simple point to two of the armed guards who he gestures to guard the men at the controls. The controlmen seem to be waiting impatiently, hands on their guns as the systems prep. Attention continuing on the Knight, "I would like to hurt you, but you're skilled enough to deflect into controls. Shut the panel, so we can continue this."

In answer, Tom rushes one of the men going for his gun. Both his maces impact the luckless gunman at once, sending him flying hard against the far wall of the control room. Again he stands ready, his deadly maces out in silent threat.

Herculan leaps after the Knight, bringing his hand downward to snatch GK from the air, to no avail. Heavy legs land on the bridge, before he sharply stands in a wicked uppercut, missing GK's bone chin by hairs. The alien takes a step back, moving into a defensive posture, nodding in approval.

The soldiers sit down, beginning to punch in the keys on the console. The system has booted up, and multiple screens open up. "Weapons systems are live, sir." "Bubble in place, sir."

The Knight whips around, steel mace spinning through the air into the Weapons' console, the soldier's head spared from spraying glass and electronics by his guard. However, GK doesn't come away clean; just as he extends in the throw, Herculan's hand slams into his chest. The orange veins streaking across his skull flares, as the Knight feels his reflexes shrink, reflexes dulling. A more agile fist streaks in over the remaining mace, hitting squarely into the vigilante's throat. Nothing happens, except furrows dragged in the bridge's floor from the impact.

Herculan punches again, this time more readily evaded. Immediately the alien jerks back as bullets streak past him, and right past the Knight. "You're powerful," comments the alien, his form rocking from side to side. "You can't keep this up-" "Sir!" Announces the soldier at the weapons system, "We have a problem!" "What?" "The surface weapons, they didn't receive specifics on targets; they're live, and on default, targeting everything above as hostiles." "No matter."

As he moves to attack, the Ghost Knight is struck - hard. Herculan's well-aimed blow strikes even through his armor plating, belting him back against a wall, and the armor falls away as Tom's control of it disappears.

Herculan is quick on the Knight, half planted in one of the steel walls. Digging the man out, he drags the vigilante across the floor. Those orange ridges flare like christmas lights, as soldiers gather around, pointing their weapons downwards. "Get that console online; I want visual of the surface battle. As soon as the mind melder is down, I will go up. But until this warrior has the honor of being my strength."
