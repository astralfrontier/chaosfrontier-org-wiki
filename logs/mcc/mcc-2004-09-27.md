Herculan and Lazer are still being processed when something occurs to Tom. After a minute or two speaking quietly with his teammates, the Ghost Knight re-opens communications with UNTIL. **One other thing,** he announces, once his 'contact' appears. **The rest of the auctioned items are being stored elsewhere. We want to handle it, but if UNTIL will perform recon and provide backup, it would not be refused.**

The commanding officer looks back at the Ghost Knight blankly. "I'm half tempted to tell you no, we'll handle it. However, your men, not mine jumping into the fire. Give us the location, and give us a method of contact. You will have your information within twenty four to thirty six hours."

The Ghost nods slowly, then relays what he knows. **Then in that time, you will be witnesses to what we are capable of,** he concludes, then closes the link.

---

With the aquatic structure on park while it's determined what is to be done with it, and the team sitting on their hands waiting on UNTIL, Ghost Knight proposes an option: a day's vacation. Not four miles away is the mouth of the Mississippi, and the bay of New Orleans. With some enthusiasm and obligatory grumbling, the four make a quick teleportation jaunt onto the beach just outside of the city limits.

"Heh," Darkglow says. "Mississippi. The last time I was here, I-- Uh, was really bored and left quickly. Um." He trudges a bit faster up the beach.

Once on land, GK checks himself over a few times, then nods as though satisfied. "Armor Command: Casual Wear package number two," he announces loudly, apparently to no one. His helmet splits in half, flowing almost like water, and the deep black of his suit begins to fade into a rainbow of colors. Seams, splits and sleeves begin to appear; his boots change shape and texture at the same time. In a few seconds Thomas Temple is wearing what appears to be every-day street clothes. His costume is gone, or at least changed, and his customary smile replaces the grim demeanor of the Ghost. "It's party time."

DarkGlow tugs his baseball cap lower on his head, resettles his backpack on his shoulder, kicks sand from his boots and glances a bit worriedly at his exposed skin. He emits something between a sigh and a groan. "As long as it's inside."

Ming is much more comfortable, having traded her armor for a swimsuit which she manages to make look like a real outfit by adding a skirt. "This ought to be pretty fun," she suggests. She's eager to see just what New Orleans has to offer.

After a short walk, the team climbs up onto the board walk. A casual beach setting, with fishers hanging off the peer, stands with food and knicknacks, the congregation of youths and old folks. At 11 am, the only people out are tourists and a few bored locals. Guy inspects a booth with oysters, only to be dragged off by Ming - no sense in having him gagging the whole trip in. Stepping off the board walk is a long strip road, Charlston Avenue. Up and down the street, men have taken up position with stools, hats, and a variety of instruments every block or so. They'll look at their watch, or get up to yack. There's a calm restlessness. The street must be a common thoroughfare; a few office buildings not far off, but for the most part it's a real shopping strip of Antique shops, home town restaurants and the cafes.

Thomas points out a high-roofed open-air building where the smell of powdered sweets and mouth-watering pancakes is coming from. The roof is supported by log pillars, and a dense thicket of trees grows behind it. "How about that place," he suggests, and without waiting the young man begins walking toward it.

"Sure, looks great," DarkGlow replies with something a little closer to enthusiasm, making a beeline for the shade.

Ming will tag along, giggling a little as heads turn to watch her. "It's so nice to have a day off," she says, stretching and wandering ahead with Thomas. "I can't wait until night fall, though.. when all the clubs are open!"

"Well, fortunately we have time," answers Tom over his shoulder with a smile. "That'll give us a chance to make enough money to enjoy em. How much do you guys have on you?"

Sweet Lorainne's is just above the As You Ask For It silver smith shop. Up an outside staircase leads up to the open-air outer seating, which is for the most part deserted. Just before noon in Louisiana is almost warm and wet enough to cook that pancake out on the pavement. Whenever a door swings open, it wafts the scents of grandma's kitchen.

DarkGlow shrugs. "If I can find an ATM, I can take out a few--" _Err... thousand is probably too much, I think. How much can you really spend on a day at the beach..?_ "--hundred, I guess."

"Mmm, well, I have enough to get something really good for my sister, I bet," says Ming. "I want to go get some matching outfits for us. I know her sizes well enough, I think. Did you have something in mind, Thomas?"

Thomas waves his hands about, indicating the city at large. "Nothing but food, drink, and door charges," he answers. Finding a seat, he shrugs a little. "I don't really carry money when I'm on the job, you know? But I'll pay you back."

"There's no need, Thomas," says Ming. "You've done things for my family that no amount of money can ever repay," she says. "And besides, we're friends. We look out for each other, right?"

A waitress steps outside, sidling up to the table. Dropping a quartet of faded, beaten up menus before everyone, she smiles and squats down at eye level. "Glad ya could stop by. Can ah get you something to drink? Got some fresh lemonade, made not half an hour ago."

Tom orders a Coke, plus the peculiar confection he's been smelling since he arrived: powdered sugar atop fried.. something. He's not sure what it is but he looks forward to finding out. 'Sugar Mountain' is an interesting name for it.

Pulling his eyes from the corner into which he'd been staring resolutely during Ming's and Thomas' exchange, DarkGlow quickly accepts the offer for a lemonade. _Should probably eat something, too. Been a moderately hard day._

Ming throws herself right into things. "s'only mornin', but ah think ah'll have some of that cajun chicken," she says, imitating the southern accent with a giggle. She definitely is out for the fun of this.

DarkGlow mentally shrugs. _Easier than flipping through the menu and deciding for myself._ "I'll have the cajun chicken, too."

Taking down the notes, the waitress, introduced as Antoinette, gives Thomas a pat on the shoulder. "Good thing you look healthy; Lorraine's Sugar Mountain'll put you on your feet it's so good." She gives Guy a curious look when he mentions Chinese. "Well, we do have Jumbalya..." Antoinette just gives a goofy grin at Ming, before disappearing back inside.

Thomas gets his Coke a minute later, and unscrews the bottlecap. It's real glass, with a real cap, and Tom stares at it for a moment. "You know," he says, "I wonder how many of these people realize there's a high-tech underwater fortress parked a few miles away. Look at 'em." He gestures with the bottle's opened mouth at the street. "Everybody's just doing their thing. Makes you wonder how much people really miss in life."

DarkGlow smirks at Thomas. "That's more a thought for the lonely wee hours. Let's not entertain them now, okay?"

"I don't think they really miss it," says Ming. "I personally am doing my best not to think of it at all," she adds. "Today is all for fun. I've put in enough time as of late with my neck on the line. Still, there's something addictive about doing really important things."

"Your neck?," asks DarkGlow. "What about your hips? They seemed to attract more... attention, earlier."

Thomas shakes his head at the byplay. "Come on, I'm serious here," he insists. "Near-earth misses from asteroids. Magnetic pole reversal. The more you know about the world, the more you have to worry about. But maybe ignorance is bliss.."

DarkGlow shakes his head. "'Ignorance is strength'," he quotes. "I thought everyone knew that. Or didn't, I guess."

"Well, what good is worrying if you can't do anything about it?" asks Ming. "No matter what, we need to remember we're only human at heart." She hums to herself a little, her feet tapping restlessly on the floor. She's pretty energetic today.

"Alright, alright," says Tom, holding up his hands. He leans back in his chair and turns his head, calling toward the kitchen. "HEY! Did you know the Lost Continent of Atlantis was discovered a few miles away?" he announces.

DarkGlow fights a reflexive urge to merge with the shadows, and settles for sinking lower into his chair.

At the next table, "I thought Atlanta was a few states away?" "No matta. Wonder if they got cheap land up there."

Thomas takes a long swig of his Coke and uses the bottle to gesture. "See?" he says. "They don't care. That's why they put up with people like us."

Ming giggles and shakes her head at Thomas. "Why mistah Temple, you really shouldn't try causing such a scene," teases Ming, using her southern belle accent once more. "Anyway, why should they care? Would you believe it, in their shoes?"

Thomas shrugs. "Probably not," he admits.

"We could offer tours," DarkGlow suggests.

Thomas nods slowly, and takes a quick drink from his cola. "See? Now that's a good idea. 'Forbidden Island Tours. Witness the marvels of the mad doctor and his mechanical floating paradise.'"

Ming snickers, "Yeah, I bet they would. Still, seems kind of silly to make something like that in the first place, doesn't it?" She shrugs, "There's just no accounting for tastes, is there?"

Guy perks up. "Maybe I could dress up and pop out as the head cheese. Go 'Boo, mwhahahaha'."

Thomas laughs a little. "Well, okay. So what's wrong with an island? Professor, let's say you have an unlimited budget and want a secure place to live. What do YOU do?"

"Has a space station been done, yet?" DarkGlow queries.

"Build a base on an asteroid," says Ming. "I mean, the island is rather cumbersome, don't you think? And honestly, you'd have a great view."

"Uh-huh," agrees Tom, a little dubiously. "How do you get down?"

"Skydiving would be fun," pipes in Guy, "But it would be a little hot on the way down..."

Ming grins, "Oh, I don't know... I guess I'd just have to 'think' about it," she teases. With her teleportation, she is probably meaning that literally.

Thomas grumbles. "Fine, fine, how do **I** get down?"

"Ming could carry you in her arms aross the threshold of the atmosphere..." DarkGlow suggests.

In answer, Tom sticks out his thumb and makes a jerking motion in the manner of a hitch-hiker. "Sounds romantic," he says, deadpan.

"Well, you didn't say I was going to have to have a place for house guests," says Ming. "But I imagine if I can get there myself, I can get someone else there. Or maybe just put a rocket on it and cruise it around the solar system.."

Ming shrugs at the mention of romance, "I guess I wouldn't know, honestly." Here she kicks Guy and says, "So are you saying everyone who came to visit would leave having the hots for me?"

Guy ows, cradling his leg over-dramatically. "If you kick all of them, they may give you the cold shoulder. But you're in an asteroid. All bottled up together, they probably would get the hots."

DarkGlow makes a soothing gesture. "You know Guy is prone to exaggeration. I'm sure no one would get the hots for you."

Ming sighs, "Thanks, you are a real pal, there." She idly recalls, "You know, there should be quite a few people around here who speak French. I could use some practice, I've been slouching off in my studies lately."

The food arrives. Guy speeds up the rate of cooling for his bowl, putting a finger inside to ensure it doesn't get frosty. Taking a suck on his finger, the detective winces. "Ooooh boy. This is like real chinese."

"Finding a native French speaker should be easy," quips Tom. "As an American, say something in French and wait to hear who insults you."

DarkGlow looks disgustedly at Guy. "Somehow I doubt the cook is Chinese. How good can it be?"

"I don't know. I'm afraid to take a bite," replies Guy, poking at it with his spoon.

Ming looks to Guy and decides to try Thomas' idea. She informs Guy that the cook could have used dog food and he wouldn't have known the difference in fluent French, then giggles and explains what she said to him. She'll eat her chicken without fear. She likes spicy food, fortunately.

Guy finally takes a bite, mulls it over, and exclaims, "Arf."

DarkGlow bites into his chicken. "Figured as much--pretty tame. They got any 'special sauce' around?"

"You shoulda asked for hot sauce there honey," announces Antoinette as she refills Ming and DG's glass. "I'll be right back."

DarkGlow looks skeptically at her retreating back. "We'll see..."

"If you want, I'll order you a habenero," says Ming, grinning widely at Dark Glow. "It's about a hundred times as spicy as those jalapenos people talk about," she says. Uh-oh, botany trivia time.

"Yeah, I know. I make habenero poppers occasionally. It was bloody criminal when the farmers started growing 'cooler' jalapenos just so 'everyone' could enjoy them," DarkGlow laments.

The waitress returns with a glass bottle that just has the label of "Mamba Juice". Plopping it down in front of DarkGlow, "Now be careful." Leaning over to half whisper, "Don't tell Ms. Lorianne, but we soak the peppers in wasabi and tobasco before grinding 'em. Enjoy."

Leaning forward, Tom pretends to read a label on the back. "'Please sign a liability waiver before using this product'," he says, sounding serious for a moment.

"Well, maybe I can engineer you a hotter spice," says Ming. "It'd be an interesting change of pace. I bet I could get a grant for it easily enough. The military would be an easy sell for it." She looks over to Thomas and grins, "Don't expect me to try that stuff. I like hot, but I don't rush off to lick the sun."

The noise slowly begins to pick up from the street. It sounds like lunch has let off for various businesses, and a glut of tourists are coming through. It's just about now that jazz music starts up, seeming from everywhere. Guy, curious, wanders over to the ledge, before coming back. "Ha! There's a jazz man with a hat on every corner, and they're playing in sync."

DarkGlow dumps an amount over the chicken that while not exactly generous, is non-generous but certainly not overly cautious either. He takes a bit unflinchingly, chews and swallows. He blinks, but no tears come. "Wow. That's good for one, maybe even two layers of skin in my mouth. Well done." Only a bit of hoarseness gives him away. He offers the bottle to Ming. "Try some. It's good."

Guy puts his hands up like he was warding off a blow. "No way, no how. This gumbogoo is hot enough."

Thomas makes short work of his sugar-laden lunch, and quietly sips Coke with a smile.

Ming will take the bottle, but she is very cautious. She'll try just a bit and follow it with a drink of water. "Anyway.. what do you guys have on the agenda for the day? I hope you don't mind, but I do want you all to come with me to find a club where I can sing later on. Some place.. I don't know. I want a bit of class. By then I should be dressed for it."

"Nothing specific," Tom admits. "Going to a club sounds good to me."

DarkGlow thinks back to the club with the psychics. "Uh, I don't handle clubs all that well. You guys have fun though."

Ming bounces a bit, happy to have her friends to drag along with her. "Yay! I hate going to clubs alone. It's.. I don't know." Dark Glow manages to effectively dampen her mood. Not that she's letting him out that easily! "Oh come on! This will be fun! You can't hide in the dark this time."

Thomas shakes his head. "This isn't like a nightclub or a party palace or weirdo room," he says. "The stuff back in Millennium City isn't like what's down here. It's... I dunno, a lot more relaxed here. You go in for the experience, not the drugs."

DarkGlow throws Ming a sidelong glance. "Oh, I don't hide all the time. Sometimes I come out and... play."

"Then play!" urges Ming. She's annoying, to be sure. "Unless you plan on sneaking off with some girl. You know, at other times of the year you can do pretty amazing things with just a fistful of beads.. But I think going to a club is a lot more fun than that, anyway, don't you agree?"

DarkGlow switches from smugness to confusion. "Beads...?"

Ming raises her eyebrows. "You know, Mardi Gras? Silly girls pull up their shirts for necklaces of beads," she explains. "I guess we'll just have to come back so you can see it all. Um. Probably from a safe distance, though. Those girls get pretty wild."

Thomas finishes his Coke and sets the bottle down, sitting back with a contented sigh. "We need more vacation days," he concludes.

DarkGlow smiles to himself and pushes his empty plate away, enjoying the quiet burning in his mouth. _Wild girls? Sasha borders on murderous, and that's only when she doesn't feel like stepping over. I'm used to more than just hot sauce, Ming..._

"I guess I'll just give myself over to your capable hands, then," DarkGlow tells Ming. "Can't really be that bad..."

The streets of New Orleans prove to be interesting. From tours of the haunted, legend-thick places, to the Metairie Cemetary, with its' pyramid and Sphinx mausoleum, to the lazy riverboat rides, and street performers in the French Quarter. Guy even goes so far as to speed up a mime, sending the quiet man into a dizzing stumble. No one was watching anyways, or didn't care; it was a mime. Hunting down a jazz club in this town is like looking for leaves in a tree. From Funky Butt to the Red Room, as authentic and real to showy. However, Howling Wolf is the place Ming and the crew settle into, escaping the hot afternoon sun. This particular house of blues is the well-known starting point for many a famous man.

Thomas has changed attire again. Rather than his college-boy look from earlier, he's now wearing a dark, dapper suit, complete with tie and even sunglasses, all courtesy of his ultra-tech armor. His hair is slicked back and his gait is loose and careless; now that he's had a chance to watch the people of this carnival city in action, he's putting his nascent acting talents to practice.

Ming is instantly comfortable. She's heard of this place, of course. As a student of music, she's definitely interested in hearing the freshest blues that the country can offer, and this is a great place to hear it. As she says for about the tenth time to her friends. She's swapped out her makeshift outfit for an elegant (but still quite flirtatious) dress of dark blue silk, courtesy of Visa. "Mmm, it's like entering a shrine," she says, feeling the music wash over her.

DarkGlow glances at her. He's doffed his cap indoors, but otherwise looks the same as when he first stepped out of costume. "Shrines, I've always thought, where rather quieter."

Even before happy hour, the place is starting to get thicker in crowd. The house backup band is a crew of stuff too smooth and slick to look anything but cool. The man on stage can really blow a trumpet like the wind through hollow places, calling goosebumps in a march across the room. He ends his set under a sea of approval, walking off stage and leaving, for a minute or two, without a show.

Ming sees her chance and goes up to introduce herself to the band. With a little persuasion she has herself a stage and a very interested audience. She introduces herself with lazy ease, then aims to surprise and impress with a remarkable, deep, purring version of Old Man River. She again proves to be even more confident on stage than in front of a class. She just loves every second.

When Ming stops, there's a moment of stillness, before the first clap starts. And from there it's an avalanche of applause. One of the band men even offers a little howl and pearly white grin. "Got another song in you, blue canary?" Calls another, waving his sax. "We got time, they got ears."

Ming considers for a time, then has an idea. It's a change of pace, to be sure, but it lightens things up. And shows off her range. She lets fly a warm rendition of Flying Teapot, aided with a fair bit of sass from the saxophone and the trumpet. She's having far too good a time to surrender the stage earlier than she has to, after all. If they keep asking, she'll keep going!

And it keeps going for fourty minutes, with vast approval from the audience, and agreement from the stage manager. Ming leaves the stage with the whole room pleased, and a "come on back anytime" from the stage manager. Ming delivers the place into the evening festivities, and the music plays on.

DarkGlow looks around somewhat bemusedly at the clapping crowd and beaming singer. Both are strange to him, unfamiliar. He wonders what it would be like to one of the multitude, staring up with rapt attention, attraction plain in their gazes. Or what it would be like staring down and meeting all those eyes with grace and humour, knowing that you are the sole thing on their minds--and enjoying it. His own gaze returns to the table he is seated at and, face as still as when he'd first looked about, he picks up his glass of ginger ale. His gaze rakes over his two companions but they don't notice, staring as the others do. _Even here, even now._ Alone, he sips from his glass.
