# Millennium City Chronicles 2004-10-18

Cut off from the others, and his Sense of Perception fogged, the Ghost Knight has little option but continue alone. The hallway that leads off is forked, and he takes a left, heading in the general direction they were before. While doors are an occasional spot on the hallway wall, the Knight knows their contents; utilities, old store rooms full of artwork or furniture, an armory - at least one floor down - and other useless objects.

As he continues, the scenery begins a slow transgression from drab steel to the darker shadows hiding at the corners of Millennium City's night streetscape. A realistic facade, down to the florescent lights mounted beneath walkways and alongside buildings, offering a general well-lit thoroughfare, with its darker side streets.

_An illusion? Or have I really moved? More likely the former,_ thinks Tom to himself, while his dead and expressionless mask reveals nothing. _A defense of the house? Or a powerful mentalist?_

Without pause, the Ghost Knight continues, staring hard at the plastic and metal of the city he calls home, unable to pierce through the facade. Stepping to a wall, a gloved hand touches the wall, seeking some familiarity. The sounds of some hoodlums combing from another street are ignored, as his powers ripple through the wall, and his powers ram into something - a force field. For a moment, he loses it, finding instead an expanse, but the walls begin to break away, returning to the drab steel once more.

_An illusion after all. Then.. I will need to be cautious._ And so thinking, Tom summons to mind the memories of his earlier inspection of the villa. His sense of perception may be unreliable now, but his memories are unfogged, and for a few seconds he thinks back along his route, to determine just where he is now - and where next he must go.

Of everyone in the team, Tom knows perhaps best of all what a phantom of the mind can do. His father exercised his telepathic gifts in innumerable ways over the years, training his son hard to be the man he now is. Some of those lessons, even though they had no purchase in reality, were painful and brutal. _I can still be shocked unconscious,_ he reminds himself. _But to be real, the illusion must also follow what my mind will accept. I can still defend myself._

Recalling the pathways from before, two corridors down should lead him to another juncture, where DarkGlow may be. Even if he isn't, there is a stair nearby, where Clarity may be. The quicker Clarity finds them, the sooner the machine's tricks will be blocked. With haste, the Ghost Knight takes down the corridors, and waits at the intersection. And waits. For what seems like ten, twenty minutes, nothing. Until Guy's fedora peers around the edge of an interesection. "Hey. Is that you? Or are you just in my head?"

Pausing, Tom considers. Another illusion, designed to deceive him? And if not, Tom's only method of verification might be seen as an attempt to elicit information. He settles on a compromise question. **I am real, but you may not be. What is DarkGlow's favorite food?**

"Wait wait," replies Guy. "How do I know you're not just trying to get me to tell you so you can trick me? Or trick someone else. Or..." He frowns, and rubs the back of his head. "This is confusing. But he likes spicey food. The hotter, the better."

Guy quickly asks, "Now you tell me what Clarity's real name is."

The Ghost shakes his head. **Listen to your own words. Favorite food is harmless - but real names can be used for further deception,** he says.

The detective shakes his head. "Okay, okay, you **sound** smart enough to be the Ghost Knight. Weither you're an illusion or not, let's just go find Clarity. You'll lead me the wrong way or not, so you go first."

Thomas holds up his gloved hands in a gesture of resigned compliance. The issue hasn't been settled yet - not conclusively - but he's willing to accept things for now. **Come,** he says, leading the way threaded in his memories.

The corridor leads to the stairs, as the Ghost Knight's memories recall. They step out into a small, open room and the stairwell behind them is quickly sealed off once more. The ceiling again rotates, baring the guns on their tracks. This time though, there's less room to maneuver. As the weapons prime, the Ghost Knight spies that several of the guns are merging on one bar along the ceiling.

Taking a chance, the Ghost stretches out his hand, fingers splayed out. He curls them slowly, exerting his powers on the gun-barrels, forcing them to curl around and bend inward in imitation. _Guy can defend himself... and if he is not Guy, we shall see._

Several of the guns slow down, their beams erupting and dragging through the air like feathers, while Guy teleports out of the way, missed by a stray weapon. The dismantled weapons the Knight has twisted explode. The eruption tears one of the tracks from the ceiling, whipping it down to crack against the detective's head as he reappears.

The shock of seeing his teammate go down sends Tom's mind reeling for a moment - but the shock is enough. After a moment, he sees destroyed weapons, but no trace of his teammate. **You will not mock me!** he shouts to the uncaring walls around him. After a moment of silent contemplation, he gestures, summoning twisted remnants of metal into his hand. They hone themselves into a pair of sleek fighting-sticks, and with weapons in hand, the Ghost stalks forward into the gloom.

DarkGlow's mouth tighens. _Lovely. Funny how this what I'm used to and now I'm sudden missing even Ghost Knight's ugly... whatever._ Shadows flow over his hand, sharpen impossibly. A few steps forward and their edge is tested against the barrier before him. _So, easy or hard? Me, I'm betting hard, but that's just my natural optimism..._

The barrier flickers as the blade rakes across it at the hit. DarkGlow notices that at the strike, there's a moment's weakness where the barrier dims. After a heartbeat the indent of his blade reseals. Through the shield, DarkGlow can see Guy waving his hands, before pointing at the barrier in front of him. It flickers too, before slowly thinning, thinning to a stop, to appear like a ripple of energy through the air. Guy then wiggles between the ripples.

DarkGlow regards Guy through the barrier with some annoyance. _I said skullface, not Guy. Crap. Ah, well..._ He cuts at the barrier harder, less tentatively than before.

The barrier wavers, then lapses for a second, and begins to return a moment later. That moment never comes, as Guy hurries forward and jumps through, before the force field returns once more. "Didn't think that would work!" He wipes himself off.

DarkGlow frowns. "I kinda wish it hadn't. I'm supposed to be trying to get to the other side of this thing, not punching holes so you can get through."

"Ah. Right. You're the one punching holes here. Waaaaitasec, how do I know you're really you, and not just another of these blasted illusions I keep running into? Like that last guy..." The detective looks perplexed.

"Illusions? You mean like the water from before? This just gets better," DarkGlow comments sourly. "To answer your question, I could hit you if you'd like."

"I don't think that would work. For all you know, you could just be thinking you're hitting me. Or vice versa..." Replies Guy. "Uhm, I suppose I'll just have to trust you for now. But if you kill me, I'm going to be really cross."

DarkGlow smirks despite himself. "And we couldn't have that, could we? And you're right, I suppose I could just be thinking I was hitting you and, really, where's the satisfaction in that?" He eyes Guy speculatively. "On the other hand..."

DarkGlow pulls his attention back to the barrier. "You see anything important on the other side?"

"Not a thing. Nothing I could be sure was real anyway. You?" Guy shakes his head, then glances around. "Hm."

DarkGlow nods. "Yeah. I've seen nothing. Up the corridor, I guess. If it's all illusory, it should be a real laugh." _Illusions, illusions..._ he thinks, reaching forward cautiously. _What the hell do I know about--_ His hand cracks through something that isn't there, and reality goes to pieces around him. Spinning wildly, he finds himself again alone, and staring at the force field. _I'm glad I didn't have a big lunch..._

DarkGlow glances carelessly left and right, an acid expression etched into his face. He shakes his head, then stares again down the corridor. "A real laugh," he repeats, and starts walking.

Rights and lefts, with nothing of interest. DarkGlow is starting to doubt if he's walking in the right direction, or just being lead in circles. Then the floor before him peels away, and up from the depths of the floor below emerges the Ghost Knight like some wrathful spectre. His fist curls around a set of papers, while the deep pits of his eyes narrow. **I know.**

"And up from hell just to let me in on the secret? How courteous." DarkGlow rolls his eyes and shakes his head. "Since I think we're supposed to be headed towards the basement, mind dropping me off on your way back?"

The Knight's response is throwing the stack of papers at DarkGlow.

DarkGlow sighs. "52-pickup was never my style, even as a kid--whenever that was." He kicks at the pile. "Secrets are a pain in the ass, but old bony is more for quiet chats in a dark corner than showering one with proof positive. You've got the overblown melodrama down, but your direction's just a bit off. I think you'd do better with lions and tigers, myself." _I meant to step forward then, all arrogance and annoyance._ He looks up from the kneeling position in which he finds himself. _I did mean to just walk on._ Papers are in his hand, and his head dips towards them. _So why am I reading the damn things?_

The papers are brief, but detail two instances. Both occuring in Chinese restaurants, one in San Antonio, the other in New York. One meeting dates ten months ago, the second a year before. The purpose of the meetings is clear: one party seeking the second about the death of a third. The names of the targets are there, written in plain ink. Their pictures are tacked into the papers too. The same man is in both occasions, one who's pale, wears a cloak, and ordered the spiciest thing on the menu. The names ring a bell to DarkGlow. As do the two meetings.

The Ghost Knight reaches into the adjacent wall, and draws from it a gleaming mace.

The paper crumbles into a ball in his fist. "The first restaurant sucked, though that may have been because the chef didn't believe me when I said 'hot'. The second was good; I'd go there again." He stands, flicks the ball off the other's chest. "I came within a bare heartbeat of telling Clarity all this ages ago, in more detail than mere paper could hold, and the only reason I didn't was far out of my hands." Shadows flicker around him like storm clouds gathering. "And now you expect me to go all teary-eyed that I've been 'found out'? Balls to that. You want me to fight some fake Ghost Knight? Fine. The real one would kick my ass--you aren't that good." Head down, eyes narrowed, shadows surround him thickly. "Come on. Just remember than when I really find you, it won't be illusion I'll be slicing apart..."

_Illusion. Will probably hurt like hell anyway. Don't even know if this stuff arond me is real shadow. Feels like it, but I guess that's the point. Not gonna stop me from trying to tear him apart, anyway. For all the good that'd do. What's he bloody waiting for, anyway? Behind me?_ He glaces, cat-quick, down the corridor for a flanking attacker. _Nothing._ His gaze snaps backs so quickly his head spins, and keeps spinning until he falls. Adreneiln surging to make his heart burst, he pushes himself back to his feet--in an empty corridor.

Heart rate spiking, blood pressure building, he buries his blade into the corridor wall. He pulls it out--no effect. _Of course not, you blasted idiot. It's all illusion, immaterial._ He cuts into it again, shadows from his hand slicing into the wall, shadows from his arm merely painting it. _Immatertial projections. Shadows._ He starts back down the corridor, walking anywhere. It'll come to an end, he knows. The sweat coating him now chills him. _Just shadows. And I wonder what I can make of that...?_ He walks, almost looking forward to whatever comes next.
