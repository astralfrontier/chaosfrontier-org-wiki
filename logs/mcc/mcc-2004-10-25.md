# Millennium City Chronicles 2004-10-25

Clarity catches the source of the psychic 'buzz' and is on its scent like a hound. Still, this place provides few straight paths, and Clarity learns that any that seem clear are hiding something. The first such hall leads her on a thirty foot race, running a gauntlet of machine gun fire aided by cunningly strung piano wire. When the trap manages to draw blood, Clarity loses her patience.

One of the concealed guns is torn from the wall and thrown with so much force at the other side that numerous supports are shattered in the process. The psychic reaches out then, brushing the the wires away like cobwebs with the strength of her will and moving on, her eyes fixed dead ahead, smouldering with a growing anger.

Again and again she weaves her way down passages, smashing traps with grim pleasure. On one long passage the floor simply falls away, and yet before Clarity has descended more than a few inches she simply vanishes, appearing on the far ledge and walking on, eyes fixed ahead, ignoring the sound of rushing flames behind her.

At last Clarity senses the source of that terrible buzzing is nearby. Past a rather sturdy door, from the looks of it. Even doors have limits, though. Again she uses her telekinetic powers to lash out, this time tearing the rail right off the stairs and throwing it full-tilt against the heavy door. The contact rocks the door on its hinges. The next strike does not use a railing, but slams the door with the full force of Clarity's strength directly. This blow causes an ominous creak in the hinges, the next puts a considerable bow in the door. The next shatters all four hinges at once, throwing the door inside the room, where it lands with a resounding crash.

Light from the hallway pierces the gloom, but does not chase it away. It reaches far enough to glimmer across murky water. Clarity steps in further, and as her eyes adjust to the light, the sight before her slowly fades into reality. A tank of water, dark and dirty, silhouettes of wires drawn to the central mass of a dark shape. The faint glow of electrodes attached to... She stares into the container, and its shape finally comes to her. A brain. The size of a basket ball, pulsing, psychic energy rippling off of it as the machinery beside the tank whirrs.

After several heartbeats, the buzz of the psychic ocean draws into a moaning, the tide washing over Clarity, over her shield. But despite her defenses, something comes from it like a song through the static of bad reception. "... Release... Me... End... This..."

Clarity peers at the captured mind in sorrow and disgust. Still, there can be no denying this. She must free such a thing, and there is only one way. Silently the door she blasted off its hinges rises, and Clarity solemnly intones (( Your wish.. )) and as she throws it full tile at the tank that holds the brain, finishes her thought (( is granted.. ))

---

Clarity, stumbling away from the room where the brain was held captive sets herself on a stair. With her mind she reaches out to her team mates. First to Dark Glow, then to Ghost Knight, and finally to Guy, drawing each of them back into a mind link. If it wavers more than before, it is not without reason. The psychic seems to be exhausted. (( Everyone alright? ))

A low, throbbing pain echoes down the link from DarkGlow's end, accompanied by the vague sensation of him rubbing his temples. (( Fine, fine. I was just taking a hard look around. I'm almost sorry-- Actually, no I'm not. I still had no idea how to get out. We _are_ out now, right? ))

Clarity sends along the link what she did to sever the little illusionary pipeline. (( I guess a mind isn't always a terrible thing to waste, huh? )) The joke is rather feeble, and unlike her. She obviously didn't find that very funny. (( I can find you, I think. I'm not sure you can even get here, I did so much damage. Places might even be about ready to cave-in, for all I know. ))

DarkGlow looks around a bit apprehensively, though sees nothing out of the--at the moment a highly subjective--ordinary. (( By 'cave in', do you mean physically or illusory? ))

After several moments, another voice joins in. (( I have seen some of that violence done. I will be with you shortly. )) Wherever he is and whatever has happened, Tom Temple sounds intensely pissed off.

(( Ah, now _that's_ the skullface I've grown to know and lo-- Err... Know. Let's just leave it at that. )) DarkGlow comments as he hears the new voice.

(( I.. I mean physically. )) Clarity sounds a bit nervous. (( I didn't actually realize how much damage someone like me can do. I hope the authorities didn't need anything for evidence. )) In particular the room with the brain in it sustained incredible amounts of damage. There's little left there that is larger than a marble.

DarkGlow frowns. (( You mean there's nothing left for me to-- )) _Let's edit that 'slice up' to, oh, I don't know--_ (( --capture? ))

(( No, at least none of that, )) answers Clarity. She sighs mentally and looks around. Hopefully Thomas will be popping by soon. (( I imagine that we're still not alone. Still.. I'd be happy to withdraw and regroup. ))

DarkGlow glances up and down an empty corridor. (( So... exactly where are you, anyway? ))

After a moment, and still with hints of anger, another feeling comes from Tom through the psychic bridge. It is the unnatural sense he possesses of nearby matter; again, black spots are silhouetted on the god's-eye view his power grants.

DarkGlow looks vainly for a 'You are here.' indicator, shrugs, and then starts walking. (( And the black bit that's me is... ))

The 3D map of the building is drawn through the mental connection. Two auras are on the third floor. The Knight can determine which he is, and after a moment's scrutiny, DarkGlow gets used to the perception and identifies himself. A third is still on second floor, seeming to have went around in circles. Clarity can distinguish the one at the very bottom floor as her own. The central column of force field is still there, but the bottom segment has disappeared, baring a room filled with five auras.

DarkGlow locks onto Clarity's shadow, and steps forward and out of it. "Good to see you again," he says, then his eyes narrow. "If it really is you." He pokes at her shoulder.

Clarity slumps away from Dark Glow, letting out a sigh. "Next time poke something that isn't hurt," she mutters in annoyance. "Still.. it's very good to see someone who isn't trying to kill me." She sends along the link, (( Five of them, it seems. I suppose I could just finish what I started. I don't know that the force field will help them much when I bury them under a hundred feet of rubble. ))

DarkGlow pokes at her again. "Hey," he says, quite without thinking, "what would your sister say about you talking so calmly about burying people alive?" Surprise shuts his mouth with a click, and he stares at his finger like he's never seen it before. "Uh... I mean... Nevermind."

There's an explosion near where DarkGlow and Clarity have gathered. A burst of dust and rubble fills the air for a moment, and out of the swirling cloud a black shape steps. The Ghost is wielding his favored weapons, and even given his normal appearance seems none too happy. **They have moved, and revealed the presence of a way out. We must get down there now.**

(( Uh... hey, is this thing on? )) Guy is very doubtful as to what is going on, but, it's worth a shot.

_Very_ glad of the interruption, DarkGlow immediately asks, "Where?"

Clarity rises rather unevenly as the wall comes down. She lets out a relieved sigh. Phew. She thought maybe she really had caused a cave-in. (( Yes this is on! What do you think? )) she shoots across the link, sounding tired and annoyed, now. (( Let's find these people and put dents in their hedas! ))

(( Well I don't know what I think anymore. Uhm. I don't think I can get to you guys. )) Guy looks around. (( I don't know if what I'm seeing is y'know... real. Heck. How do I know you guys are real? ))

DarkGlow shoots an annoyed glance at the ceiling. (( Look, I know you're a dick by trade, but now's really not the time. Get your butt down here and let's finish this. I want to go home. ))

Clarity turns her attention back to Dark Glow, ignoring for now Guy's fumbling. "Of course I won't really do it," she admits, sighing. "I was just.. so angry before. I.. I killed someone. Or.. I killed something. It wanted me to, but still.." This is probably not the best time for her to have this kind of meltdown, though.

Guy okays (( That's detective. And. Yeah. So. Where's here? ))

DarkGlow pats her awkwardly on the shoulder, suddenly awash in memories of a boy struggling on a bed under think layer of shadow. "I'd be worried if you didn't feel anything. I won't say it'll be all right--you're not stupid--but sometimes it really is kill or be killed. The good guys only get lethal when they really need to--and with the powers we've got, I'm guessing that shouldn't be too often. I'd suggest talking about it later, however--festering is never good, physically or emotionally."

Clarity nods at Dark Glow, offering him a smile that her mask hides, but the mental link makes clear. "Thank you," she says softly. There will be time to think later. She didn't even find out who it was.. she just lashed out, and now it's too late. She holds that sadness at bay, though. She has to be useful to her team now.

DarkGlow shrugs off her thanks and turns away to await Guy's arrival. His hands dangle at his side, and it's only in his imagination that blood silently drips off them onto the floor.

Guy appears, after a moment or two, following the map provided by GK. "Alright... is it really you? I mean, if you're not you I'm going to be really really ticked when I get out of this, and then you're all in for a serious beat-down. I mean it. So you'd better really be you." Guy clears his throat, "Presuming of course you are you... what do we do now?"

Thomas points with one mace downward. **We complete what we came for,** he says, and starts moving rapidly, following the path.

The team make short work of moving through the fourth floor towards its center, for nothing opposes them. All defensive systems that the Ghost Knight's sense falls over seem to be inactive. As they pass, the team sees that they won't be bothered on the way back, dismantling everything that might prove a threat later. Finally, they reach the double doors that leads beyond to their host.

The room is big enough to offer the central stage for a fight. However, the decoration is out of place; rather than the hub of a secret instilation or fortified hideout, the room is bedecked with finery. A long table with satin cloth stretches the width of the room, containing fine china plates, gold-rimmed glasses, and other such finary. Seats on the far side of the table slowly glide back, and from their seats draw five individuals. They are dressed in finery, from tuxedos to ensembles suited for courtiers. Upon each head is a gleaming netting anchored in a circular steel rim, except for two.

At the head of the table is Sinistra, her dress grand and sweeping, lacking the netting but instead wearing a tiara. She stands, and raises a hand as the other table members move to weaponry, or let the air surge with energy. "Let our guests take their seats. There is much to discuss. If you force our hand, there will be other things to discuss." She stares at DarkGlow pointedly, before she sits. Despite the overall sense of calmn restraint, aggravation, and more blue emotion ripples over Sinistra, while her associates are just waiting for a hostile move, remaining standing.

Thomas does not move to sit, nor does he lose his fighting stance. He does not, however, make an overtly hostile move. **We are here for the weapons,** he says, simply.

"Nah. Way I see it, there's not all that much to discuss. Ghosty there's made our point clear enough. So, we'll just be takin' them and moving on then. You can mess with someone else's head, 'kay?" Guy has adopted a defensive stance, after all, you'd have to really be crazy-or Foxbat-to not be on edge around the individuals awaiting them in this room. "'Course, there's always the hard way."

Clarity says nothing. She is ready, and she isn't about to offer a hello. For the second time today she's thinking of shooting first, getting names off bodies later. She'll just wait, though. (( This stinks of a trap. ))

DarkGlow stares back at Sinistra, face blank. In front of him, blades as thin as the imagination project from his hands, and the edges grind over one another with a thin, carrying sound worse than nails on a blackboard--his assassin's call for when the quarry is to be hunted, not slaughtered. _She should know what it means..._ He holds his position; the sound is his only reply.

Sinistra laughs. The sound almost melts into a sob, one hand rubbing her face. "The weapons," she repeats, still chuckling in that distraught tone. "What this is all about is weapons. But now I've been insulted in the face of my colleagues, I've had my home destroyed. I could care less about the weapons. They wern't mine. I wanted rid of them. Destroying them seemed a ... waste. Go ahead. T-" The one without the metallic lattice work turns to Sinistra in a snarl. "You're going to let them leave? Just... leave? They brought the UNTIL upon you, they destroyed my _work_, my device." "Good. It was disrespectful and ugly." "They," She turns and nods to the others. Almost as one, they turn, that hostilaty honed in at one place, and the eruption of power shakes the room. Sinistra rubs her face.

The Ghost steps forward. **By inviting such tools of destruction into your house, you brought this insult down upon yourself,** his dead, starkly angry voice grates. **Now you are paying the price for trafficking in such things. Spare me your self-pity.**

Clarity remains silent, waiting for all hell to break loose. She isn't about to let herself be caught by surprise. She is going to smash flat the first guy who looks for trouble with her team.

"And spare me your moral high ground!" She snaps back. "You call yourselves heros, but where is your respect for the dead? For the grieving? You _exploited_ me at the funeral of the man I loved. At my moment of weakness for being a woman with a heart. Damn you." The smoke has cleared, leaving the target, broken and beaten, crumpled inside the far wall. "The weapons are through the ceiling there," She points. "Above that, the force field controls. The building is set to self destruct. Go. If you get those damned machines out in time, good for you. If you die in the rubble, good riddance."

**For the sake of your grief, hundreds of those still living might perish,** counters the Ghost. **That is our moral high ground.**

(( I'm marginally happier about four-on-four, )) DarkGlow comments. (( I'm rather _unhappy_ about how easily--and permanently--that guy was smacked down. Take the weapons and run? ))

(( I say we can take 'em all. But... whatcha wanna bet she's bluffing? )) Guy gives a nod to the others. "Alright. So, how long do we have?"

Sinistra rises, as one of her guards kicks the table out of the way. She steps on a panel on the floor, letting it slide open slowly, exposing a stair case. The Knight's perception pierces through the floor above, discovering the weapons - stowed in force bubbles, it would seem. Above that, it appears the controls are there, and he can reach them. The woman begins the decent down the stairwell, while the remaining three fan out above the staircase, looking suspicious, antsy, and a little worried.

Thomas raises a gloved hand over head, and clenches his fist suddenly. There's a shower of debris as the ceiling explodes down around him; after a moment, dust hangs in the air and the Ghost is surrounded by a ring of rubble. On the other hand, there is now a hole in the ceiling through which people can pass.

DarkGlow's mood is slightly fowl as they move towards the weapons and away from the confrontation. _So, is this a good thing or bad thing?_ He finds he can't quite decide. The weapons are apparently being held in globes reminiscent of bubbles. Glad to have something to vent on, he sharpens a spear of shadow and prepares to pierce one when GhostKnight comments that they appear to run on light. With a scowl in his direction, DarkGlow melts the spear and instead encases the bubbles in shadow, not quite certain what to expect.

The light bubbles continue for several moments, until they flicker and melt away. A light turns on, connected to the bubble, but DarkGlow smothers that. After several moments, the bubbles flicker and melt away, exposing the seismic bomb and disintegrator.

(( Okay. Then let's get things going. )) The detective's hand blurs as he moves towards the keypad to deactivate the outer force-fields. There's a rapidfire series of angry blips, followed by a longer, more normal sounding bleep, signifying the correct passcode has been entered. (( We can get out now. And uhm, if you'll note the timer, we've uh... oh, a while yet. )) The numbers counting down to the detonation have slowed to a mere crawl, if not ceased entirely.

The first thing Clarity does is reach out for the mind of Hannah Wessels. The Sargeant is sent an urgent message, which Clarity repeats until she's positive the recipient understands. (( They are blowing the building! Move everyone away! We will be coming out shortly! Move everyone away! )) Once Clarity is completely satisfied, she turns her mind to the other task at hand. Her eyes narrow, and she takes a deep breath. (( Everyone get close to me. This boat is riding once. I don't know how well I could do on a second attempt. )) Clarity demands that everyone take a hold of her, then puts one of her hands on each of the weapons to be brought along. She's never done anything quite this large before. Still, this is a day of firsts. One of them lies crumpled at her feet. Count Revolution hardly looks so terribly impressive, on the brink of death.

Clarity's focus bears fruit after a few more milliseconds of thought. The group is in the depths of the villa one moment, outside the next. Clarity lets out a deep sigh, wavering on her feet from the strain of her biggest teleportation ever. "I.. I did it.." she murmurs. "Can someone please carry him?" she says, indicating the count.

DarkGlow shivers from the unexpected and unfamiliar teleport. _My way is better. Much better, in fact._ He tweaks Clarity's arm. "Hey, next time a) give me some more warning so b) I can help you out. It's not like you're alone in this."

Guy nods in agreement, "Yeah. You're not the only one here what can do that... but..." He grins, "Thanks for saving our respective bacon. Now... want I should let the place go boom?"

Thomas casually discards his now-useless weapons. **Guy, slow the Count down until help can arrive?** he suggests. **Now we wait.**

DarkGlow toes one of the maces. "Bet you had a compulsion to collect these when you were starting out," he tells GhostKnight.

Clarity nods to Dark Glow, then sits unceremoniously on her ass, letting out a sigh. She turns back to look at the villa. "I'll be ready to help out with any mess in a few moments. Just need to catch my breath."

Thomas laughs a little, with his human voice. "My weapons are everything that exists," he says. "This is 0.0042% of the ruined mass that the villa will yield, anyway."

The villa looks like a disaster site. Shattered windows, crumbled walls, the once beautiful building now in ruin. Armored SUVs and uniformed officers are moving out as fast as possible, some even jumping over balconies and crashing through windows. In the distance, a chopper with the UNTIL logo speeds towards the five.

"Alright guys. Climb aboard, get safely away, then I'll let the timer lapse, alright?" Guy asks. "Should be a pretty interesting blast. Unless she was bluffing."

"Sure, sure," DarkGlow continues slyly as they prepare to leave. "You've got a museum set up somewhere and give tours to ghosts, explaining that with this one I bashed so-and-so, and with this one I bashed what's-his-name. That one there is real special because that one I actually _duelled_ with, and not just bashed...."

Thomas taps the side of his helmet. "it's what's up here that matters. nothing else matters.." He raises his head, looking at the approaching helicopter.

Clarity nods to Guy, rising again. "I just need to be able to see the place. Not everyone can sprint away.. I'll do what I can to control this mess." She glares at the villa, considering things. She nods. "I can be of use in this, too. It looks like some of the UNTIL people aren't getting very far away.."

DarkGlow glances back at the villa, sobering quickly. "Funny thing about having your perception played with--in the end, only you can decide if what you see is real and not just in your head." _Which means if this happens again, I really should only depend on myself. There's a surprise._

"Uh, Clarity, no offense or anything... but I've totally got it handled. You've strained yourself enough for one day... let me handle this one, alright?" Guy nods. "Just get these guys away."

The helicopter is built to carry cargo, decked out with two full propellers. However, the fact it is military isn't forgotten, a gun turrent has been mounted on the side. It lands several yards away, the pilot waving to Team Tengu.

"You're sure, Guy?" asks Clarity as she stumbles towards the helicopter. She'll trust him. It's not like she could really do much, at this point. She's probably the only one who actually imagines she might be able to do something on such a huge scale right now.

Thomas gestures, causing the weapons to levitate and float toward the waiting transport. **We've done what we came to do,** he says. **We are unharmed. Let us be grateful, and be on our way.**

Guy nods, "I'm sure. Get a move on!"

DarkGlow still feels a twinge of disappointment that his blades remained unblooded, but it is fading quickly. "I think other parties are the ones who should be grateful, but the last sentiment I certainly agree on."

An UNTIL officer slides open the cargo bay, allowing the Ghost Knight to load the arsenal onto the chopper. Everyone else piles into the helicopter, and they wait. Finally, a transmission across the chopper's intercom that all officers are accounted for. Guy releases the mechanism. There's a rumble that shakes the ground, dust flying up from around the villa before it simply drops into the earth, crumbling to expose a gaping hole where a legacy once stood.

Guy considers this for a moment. "Well, there's a hole lot of trouble gone. I suppose we nearly blew it."

Clarity glowers at Guy, then looks to Dark Glow. (( Hit Guy for me? I'm too sore. ))

Groaning, DarkGlow mutters, "_Definitely_ a dick by trade." He grins at Clarity, then glances at GhostKnight. "You want to toss him out of the chopper, or should I?"

---

UNTIL quickly attaches a neural interface to the Count, keeping him unable to concentrate enough to use his powers while they transport him. Sergeant Wessels assures that the man will be tried for his crimes, and likely sentenced to death, considering the sheer nervousness most governments and justice systems have against mentalists gone wrong. The weapons are transported onto Lydon's jet, and the four take a long but comfortable ride home. The disintegration cannon is all ready slated to handle large debris removing in accidents, donated to the US government under stipulations they will use it world wide if need be. However, nothing has been decided as to what to do with the seismic bomb.

By the time they reach home, Shawntae's satellite is in space, and he shows his great appreciation for it. The BBC and other international news agencies run the story of Team Tengu's joint assault with UNTIL on an assault on Sinistra's compound, and despite her escape, they claim the capture of Count Revolution and his upcoming trial as a triumph. Several congradulations from across the globe come to the team, but aside from the fellow heros, various leaders, and thankful people, one message stands out. "Congradulations for escaping. There will be no retribution against you. Those who won the weapons have been payed off, or appeased. I never understood why Vulcan quit the business, but I do now. He was tired. I am tired. The next time we cross paths, do so up front. There is no bad blood." It is marked with a simple, stylish S.
