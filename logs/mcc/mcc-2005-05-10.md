# Millennium City Chronicles 2005-05-10

DarkGlow can't stop staring at the bathroom door. "That's not the woman I left," he tells Ming. "I can see her inside, but..." He shrugs. "She's different. Of course, I suppose I am as well."

Ming frowns in thought, trying to understand her way through this. "I think we're all different, now," she says softly. "But I guess that doesn't matter as much as I expected. What really matters is what you will do now." And she doesn't seem to have any useful suggestions, there.

"Me? Step in front of a bus, I should expect. Or move to a remote ranch in Arizona. Then again, finding out where my powers have gone would also be a good thing." DarkGlow laughs, shortly. "You know, I thought that 20 minutes after the next time she and I met again, one of us would be busy bleeding out on a sidewalk somewhere. I didn't think I'd be waiting for her to leave a washroom, somehow hoping splashing her face with water would miraculously lift her out of her depression. I'm not supposed to like her anymore, but we had a lot of years...

"We are supposed to do whatever we do, I think," says Ming, but it's clear her mind is elsewhere. "I don't know how we can find out where your powers went. To do that, we will have to find out where they come from to begin with, and I've spent the bulk of my life researching that." And she has yet to find anything solid.

DarkGlow casts a look of mock-horror at her. "You've spent the bulk of your life spying on me? And I never even suspected..."

Ming arches an eyebrow, "You should be wishing I had, about now. I might have a chance to fix your little problem." She grins suddenly, "At least this little incident hasn't stripped you of your greatest power. Your super smartass power is working just fine."

DarkGlow shrugs innocently. "Blame Sasha--I think I got that from her, too." He shrugs non-chalantly. "Eh, I'm not real worried--I got a telepathic mad scientist on one side and a bunch of psychics on the other. And for once it really can't get much worse."

Ming sighs deeply, "So.. am I the mad scientist or one of the bunch of psychics?" She can't help but grin a bit at this, though. "Anyway, I'll do my best with you."

The door opens down the hall, the light all ready out.

_Hey, isn't this where most people would say--?_ "Thanks," DarkGlow replies, quietly. He glances up the hallway. "So," he calls, "did the god of porcelain grant any divine insight upon receiving your sacrifice, or do we have to let Ming poke and prod our neurons again?"

Sasha walks out of the bathroom, towards the front of the apartment. "I see you havn't grown up much," is all she calls back.

Ming hmms, "Well, you two are tied together somehow, perhaps that is the key to this." She drifts off to try and puzzle that out. "That is very strange, but since I've found no genetic trace for supers, I suppose I should give up the scientific and consider the paranormal." Which means guessing, of course.

DarkGlow ignores the automatic stinging he feels from Sasha's comment, holding onto whatever semblance of good feeling he can. Deliberately, he turns to Ming. "There's no genetic link? Really?"

"I haven't found it," says Ming. "But since we're all nearly identical you shouldn't assume that my failure to do so means it's not there." She takes on an almost lecturing tone at first, then rights it as she realizes what she's doing. "Humans are over 99 percent identical, so finding out what makes a very small, seemingly random group alike is naturally very tricky. And it's hard getting samples.

DarkGlow casually offers an arm. "Apply, then, your leeches, doctor. I think I'm a C or a D--I've never gotten an A or B on a test before, plus or minus, so...."

Ming raises an eyebrow. "You know, I'm not sure that I'm flattered or offended that you think I have lab equipment at my home." She pauses for a moment, and grudgingly says, "It just so happens I do.." And she'll excuse herself for a moment only to return with a pair of needles and two packets for swabbing. "Now, just don't squirm. Sit down and make a fist. I don't want to screw up the sample." Nor poke around in DarkGlow's arm any more than needed.

By this time, Sasha has returned, leaning against the doorway and watching the exchange critically.

DarkGlow sits and makes a fist. He eyes the needle, doubtfully. _What is it about needles that I'd suddenly prefer a drawn dagger?_ "You don't use leeches anymore? Really?"

He looks over at Sasha. "You should roll up a sleeve, too. Ming wants to test for... uh, whatever it is mad scientists test for." He looks at the needle. "Did I say 'mad'? I, uh, meant..."

"Don't be a complete jackass," says Ming. She taps two fingers on DarkGlow's arm, "Good, prominent veins." She grins and breaks open the seal on the first needle. "Now, on the count of three there will be a little pinching feeling." Before she even starts counting the needle goes in and Ming is drawing blood.

After watching the proceedings for a few moments, Sasha shucks her jacket, and walks to stand behind Daniel.

DarkGlow winces at the steel stabbing--semi-gently, but still stabbing--into his arm. "Prominent? Of course they're prominent--you can practically see through my arm. Good to know my skin's good for something--pity it's only bleeding."

Ming ignores that comment, focusing on the task at hand. She's done fast, though. With the efficiency of a nurse she has the little wound bandaged safely and the sample set aside neatly. "Now, are you willing to join in this little bit of science?" she asks of Sasha.

"I didn't take my jacket off because it was hot," She replies dryly, while extending her right arm.

"You can't tell?" DarkGlow asks in identical dry tone. "She's practically jumping with enthusiasm. We've known each other for most of forever--I can tell these things."

"I imagine. Now sit," says Ming. She is already breaking the seal. "Same drill. I expect you'll be less trouble. Men are always babies about this stuff. They show no pain when they ought to and yip like kids at the littlest of hurts." And yes, she's teasing.

DarkGlow shrugs. "Last I checked, most men didn't want me lumped in with them. 'Course, I last checked in the orphanage, so..."

"It's the anticipation," admits Sasha, as she sets in and presents her arm. "You see it coming, you know it's coming, you know it'll sting." The woman seems to relax in the seat.

Ming nods, tapping at Sasha's arm patiently. "I suppose." And then she starts the draw, trying to get away from the anticipation problem. "You know, I'm just glad neither of you are fainters."

"When you're like us, the sight of blood is like water," admits Sasha conversationally.

DarkGlow glances at Sasha and grins privately. "Fainting at the sight of blood would be... inconvenient for us."

Ming grins. "Like a mirror," she says to herself. The job is done swiftly, again, and Ming has to take the vial and sets it with the other. She would have damn near a full lab at home. "This will keep it nice and clean until I can head to the university."

DarkGlow stands. "Well, while you're doing that, I guess I could show Sasha to my apartment."

"Just keep in touch. Maybe I should handle that for us?" suggests Ming. She grins a lopsided grin and adds, "I suppose you won't like that much, though. Always so nervous about me." And yet his fate may be resting in her hands.

DarkGlow's face falls into a neutral and guarded expression. "Of course." _You haven't poked around in my head nearly enough to guess why, huh? The trial comes later, then, it seems._ He smirks, but it's pale compared to his earlier expressions. "You're the most dangerous--the only woman on the team."

Beside him, Sasha merely smirks.

He bows to Sasha, then offers her a hand. "My lady?"

Sasha takes the offered hand almsot stiffly. "My lord," she returns.

He twitches an eyebrow. "Not servant? Guess I've risen in your esteem..."

"Don't push it," remarks Sasha.

Ming hmms thoughtfully. "Here, take this." She holds out the key to her apartment, then. "If you get in trouble, maybe it can't find you here. Don't worry about my sister, I'll have her stay over at a friend's house." She looks at the samples and waves a hand as if shooing the pair, now that she's said her piece.

DarkGlow nods, and accepts the key. "A moment," he says, and goes to retrieve his jacket and backpack from the room where he spent the night. He dons the jacket, and almost clips one of his black daggers to his belt, but the jacket isn't long enough to conceal it. Regretfully, he leaves it in the backpack. _Probably won't need it. And if I do, it's a piss-poor substitute for my real blade, anyway._

---

Ming's apartment door shutting is like the breaking of a window, leaving what's beyond gaping and jagged, letting in the stiff, uncomfortable air in from the other side. Each step away from Ming's apartment draws the two further into that atmosphere of hostility and barely veiled tension, hanging above their heads a guillotine of unspoken words and raw emotion, and the string's wearing thin. The string stretches tauter as the elevator plunges downward, and the silence becomes overbaring.

As the light above the door marks the sixth floor and descending, Sasha turns towards Daniel. "So you're working with Superheros now." Snap. The contempt and hidden sting of her words, not far from blatant in her eyes, severs the string holding back the weight, and it drops upon them, drowning in its' presence.

Stinging from the lash against his psyche, he drawns in a deep gulp of the smothering, prickly air. _Guess the lady/servant thing was a bit much, after all. Tweaking Sasha isn't like tweaking Ming..._ "Always hated elevators--much rather just step through shad--" he starts, but can't continue. He has to respond to her, even if he can only stare at the elevator's control panel. "Got caught. Still don't know who set me up, but they put a bomb in my spine. Say 'no' and I buy the farm. They haven't pissed me off enough for me to just say 'no'. This doesn't mean I'm not planning on slowing cutting their hearts out, however."

His shoulders twitch in a spastic shrug. "They told me to integrate with the team. I integrated."

"So you're a spy," She concludes, her words for the moment untelling. They draw towards the fifth floor, but the elevator seems to be crawling. Or maybe it's just the desire to be out of it making it longer. "You let yourself get caught? And now you're some puppet." A shake of her head. "Why did you leave?" The question is more raw than expected from either of them; peppered with as much accusation as it is a bared vulnerability. The air seems charged with the very question.

Emotion slices him deeper than any blade. He spins, steps toward her. He never did grow much taller than her, and male or not, pyhsically stronger or not, he's not much bulkier than her. But in the elevator, with every dimension seemingly collapsing in around them, even small difference are magnified. He knows she won't retreat the one step she has room for, and he presses close, their separation down to inches.

"Because," he says. "Because every day that went by drained more emotion from you. Not all emotion, just... You smiled less, you stopped laughing entirely. We had it all--or so I thought--and there wasn't an ounce of cheer left in you. Do you even remember? Bodies were piling up like..." He shrugs. "Which would have been fine, except they weren't marks. They'd just bump into you or whistle at you or whatever, and you'd go back and slice 'em. I mean, marks, fine--they deserve whatever they get. And if someone takes a shot at you, put 'em in the ground. But..." He shrugs again. "I'm a killer. I know this. Every since I strangled Jimmy with shadow. And sure, he was an asshole. But can you really just kill all the assholes? I mean _everyone's_ an asshole." He stops, leans another fraction of an inch closer. "**I'm** an asshole."

He steps back, sighs. _No dagger in the gut. I'm surprised..._ "Why did I leave? I was becoming less and less sure, under your flinty glare and with your bloodied hands, that you'd kiss me rather than kill me. And even if you didn't kill me, I knew I'd become like you, just as I have in every other way. So I left."

He presses on, without giving her a change to speak--though she could still just try to gut him without a final word. "And now _this_. You weren't supposed to find me, and if you did you were supposed to come like an avenging angel and strike me down and then I wouldn't have to worry about anything. I didn't expect to be working for a bunch of superheros witha phantom haunting me and a secret organization threatening me and having my powers just up and vanish. Now I'm tired and you don't seem to be the cold-blooded killer I grew to hate and I'm confused about pretty much everything and...." He sighs, leans back on the elevator wall and stares upwards. "And now I'm thinking that stepping in front of a bus isn't so much a bad joke as a good idea." He rights himself. "So... what'll it be?"

Third floor. The doors open to a woman hearing the tail end of Daniel's question. Sasha immediately turns and hits the closed door button. "Hey!" says the woman, trying to stop the elevator before something sends her reeling, some bad vibe or intuition that tells her to get the next one. Sasha immediately hits the Emergency stop. Somewhere in the building, a fire alarm goes off, but the sound is drown out, the lights beginning to flicker.

"Why didn't you _say_ so," Sasha breathes, but the both of them know the answer before it's left her lips: she would have punished him if he had brought it up at the time. "When I had lost and left everything in my life," she begins, her scorn hot and eyes cold, "I thought you'd left for... I don't know why. I didn't want to know. I was better off without you. I didn't need you. I wanted you hurt, but I figured you would either fuck up royally without me, or you'd make it on your own. It had occured to me a lot to come hunt you down, but I knew if I did it would be the death of one of us. And now, when we do, we can't do a damned thing about it!" There's a bitter, almost craziness to her laugh, the sound **pulsing** with the darkness that grows around them, feeling alive, listening, feeling, whispering.

---

While not the fully tricked out lab of the University, Ming's home equipment isn't half bad. The blood samples are fresh and warm in the machine, as it whirrs into life. But as she stares into the screen, something feels off, not right. A cold chill runs up her spine, then felt as though it were inside her head. Sometimes, when she touches another mind, it first feels like she's dipping into a pool or reach into a warm cloud. But there's something that caresses off the shields protecting her, something like a bottled storm. There's something in the building.

Ming looks up from her samples. Her vacant expression slowly shifts into a fixed frown as something tickles at the back of her mind. Like a fly buzzing in the back of her skull. "What now?" she demands of a mirror. Before she has any clear idea of just what she is doing she's on her feet, making her way to the door, first a hasty walk, then she starts to run. The door is blasted violently with telekinesis and Ming looks either way down the hall.

"Not there.. not there," she mutters to herself, unconciously rubbing her arms, trying to put some heat in them. "Where..? Yes!" She storms towards the elevator and with barely any thought at all she's torn the doors ajar and is leaping down, barely able to control her descent with telekinesis. "I'm coming! Damn you I'm coming!" she shouts down the shaft. Some part of her wonders what is going on. Maybe she really _is_ a mad scientist. Maybe she's finally gone insane.

---

The fire of Sasha's voice has grown to embers. "When I'd lost or left everything in my life, the only thing I had made in the world was _you_, you left, you took it away." Sasha is barely touching Daniel, the light above them a small cone gracing only them. "We'd fended for ourselves before, and I did fine on my own, but it was different. It didn't feel right. We were two of a kind, and that was split. It felt cold, I felt cold." Looking away, sounding almost like a child, "I wasn't afraid of you, but somewhere, the mistake was on my hands, and owning up to it, or admitting it, it wouldn't help anything. Maybe just not knowing was best. But even knowing now, you're right. It still feels cold inside, but... Maybe I'm tired, or hungry, or going insane, but I don't feel like a machine any longer."

DarkGlow closes his eyes, even at that slightest of touches. _Cold, she says, and cold is how I thought it would be as her shadows sliced into me._ "Tired and hungry and going insane--I know those. But empty--that I know best. A pair torn into singletons--it hurt about as badly as I figure cutting my soul in half would have done." He exhales, breath ruffling her hair momentarily. "A machine, though--that I've never felt like. There's one on the team, you know. This android or something. A woman by her shape but a child inside; looking at her innocence is almost painful. I think we made a wrong turn somewhere, or we were guided wrong or something. Somehow I think Jimmy should still be alive--sure he enjoyed making mincemeat of my testicles, and I hated him as only a thirteen year old can, but..."

He shakes his head. "I don't know what to do. I want to hug you and tell you it'll be all right and as used to do me too long ago. I want to tell you that the others on the team are assholes and excessively stupid at times, but are really okay for all that and maybe they have more of a clue about life than I do. I want to say that maybe the world doesn't have it in for us and maybe we don't have to fight the entire world because of it. I want to tell you that I love you, which puts me firmly in the insane category because I've never said that in my life and the only evidence I have for it is how often I've obsessed about you--mostly thinking bad thoughts, by the way, which just makes it more insane. What I think I will say is that the apartment next to mine is empty--and if it isn't we can make it so--and I think I'd really like you to move in there. I mean we can always kiss and/or kill each other tomorrow, or next week or whenever, right?

Sasha is quiet. All to quiet, while she stares back at Daniel. The hints, only the hints of a smile tickle at the corners of her lips. "I don't know," She says at last. "But we'll figure it out."

LIke a leaking balloon, the oppression on the pair's mind and emotion begins to deflate, the darkness lurking in the corners of the elevator becoming twilight. Above, the door is torn open, any remnants of the isolating darkness inside of them shattered as Ming peers into the car. While the woman cannot see it, her mind's eye can preceive it; fragments of subconcious clinging to the two like cobwebs and floating in the air, once a concious tempest, now a mere shadow of the Id.

She can touch it, see into it; the broken pieces of memories, both ugly and good, tatters of a suspicious, overbaring personality. As more of the fractured subconcious is explored, the pieces of the puzzle are put back together; a mentalist, in his final moments, had compelled two children to the spot he knew he would die in. And as he died, part of his conciousness was slipped under theirs, a way to live on. But the longer it stayed in the pair's minds, the more it infected theirs with his pscyhe, not only his powers but personality beginning to rub off on them. The halves, while bound, had so much stress after being seperated, fed the hostility between the two. Somewhere in the tangle of the once powerful mind shaper are their powers, coloring pieces like the tint of a glass.

Ming frowns thoughtfully, studying the web closely. She purses her lips, "Now I finally see it. How could I not see it?" The mentalist sighs softly, the sound coming more like a wasp in flight, or perhaps a snake through dead leaves. "The gene test is not going to help much," she says abruptly as she stares down at the two.

DarkGlow smiles about as much as Sasha does. He brushes a lock off hair way from her eyes, where sweat had plastered it. "Which reminds me--I also want to come up with more bad jokes to try to get you to laugh." He looks up at Ming. "What do you mean?" he asks, and is succinctly told. He looks back to Sasha. "So the question then becomes, if he's gone, do we still have our powers?"

For a few moments, Ming's plagued with the problem. The powers, how are they- The elevator lurches into a start. Lowering to the first floor, the doors open to a man - or a figure in the shape of a man. HIs suit is fine, but his face is... undescribable, as though it were hidden by a bright light they could not pierce. The voice that comes is laced with a french accent, and somehow he feels familiar to DarkGlow. "It will be a challenge. The rot must be sifted from the gems, but I believe Ms. Ming is capable of it." Ming, still perching on the roof, can see the man's face perfect. It's made of sharp lines, a faint mustache peppering above the lip, and a receeding hairline. "I am the Doctor." His lips quirk, almost amused. "I am... making a house call. Mr. Temple said you might need me."

Ming raises an eyebrow. "I see." She frowns in thought, "So, the challenge is to sweep away what is not needed, and keep what is required, only that way can they have their powers back." She wonders, though, how she can do that..

"Mr. Temple is-- uh, probably not the one I'm thinking of," DarkGlow says to Sasha. "Which doesn't help much." He eyes the other, tries not to narrow his eyes suspiciously. "Uh, Ming? What's going on?"

---

The four draw back up to Ming's apartment, after The Doctor and Ming 'collected' the fragments remaining. Later, Sasha and Daniel are unconcious, layed out on Ming's bed. The two mentalists, Ming leading and the Doctor guiding when she mis-steps, they peel apart the pieces of the long gone mentalist. Plucking out every aspect of the dead man, then carefully sift the remaining pieces into the minds of the two. It is a long, grueling process, each as delicate as surgeons inside the webs of the pair's minds. Hours pass, sweat sticking to their brows, the job is finally done. Finally, the Doctor aids Ming in pulling apart the remaining shreds of psyche until they are but a few stray bits floating in nothingness. "In time, they will fade," says Ming's new guide. And in time, the two callers of shadow can once more bend the power of darkness to their will.
