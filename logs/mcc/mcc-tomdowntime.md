# Millennium City Chronicles tomdowntime

Never one to let a job slide into lassitude, Thomas Temple has draped himself comfortably over one bench at Wayne County Metropolitan Airport, twelve miles away from the city proper, and the closest approach to it by air - at least, by conventional air, he grins to himself, remembering the mutual assistance he and Lydon will render to each other. A psychology textbook is laid open on his lap, and he peruses it only superficially, for the larger part of his mind is spent studying the storage lockers nearby. His sense of perception rifles lightly through them when he can, when a passing body doesn't obstruct his \`view'.

Apparently some of the population has been naughty. There are a handfull of things that can catch the interest. One has a standard duffle bag full of artillery, ranging from a beretta with a silencer to a submachine gun pistol. Another has a laptop, and as the mental evaluation goes, three thousand dollars. A third has... something a little more interesting. Even with the perception combing through, the device's puprose isn't... exactly determinable. Whatever it is, though, it is certainly impressive, or expensive.

After spending several minutes going over the item, something clicks for Tom. While it is not precisely the same, some of the layout holds similarities to an electro-magnet, but things are certainly different and altered within the item itself, so the capabilites he is not sure of, and there is the feeling that this isn't merely ment to pick up pennies.

Casually - and with enough inspection beforehand to make sure he isn't being witnessed - Tom ambles toward the 'interesting' lockers, one by one. In each case he leans close enough to the locker so that his body blocks vision of what he actually does. And he walks away from each after a few moments, to return to his reading, or get a snack, or something casual. And left behind, in the door of each locker, is a micro-transmitter, rigged to broadcast when the door is opened. Another set of passes, and the bags and laptop are likewise tagged with trackable transmitters. Only the strange gizmo itself is left untouched, though its door too is tapped to notify him when opened.

With that accomplished, Tom makes a few useless inquiries at the information desk, for a plane he knows will be late anyway. Apparently satisfied with the information he receives, he walks out of the airport and arranges transportation back to Millennium City proper. Time to visit the Culture district..

An eight block square is the Cultural District of Millenium city. A way to appease the different, smaller minorities, and to encourage ethnic diversity and immigration, each area is devoted to different ethnic groups. Polish, Greek, Indian, Japanese, and Chinese, along with a few smaller groups, make up the District itself. Not to mention the opera, the symphony, and a few museums make up some of the area, and a few less impressive office buildings (those that couldn't afford Renaissance Square). But little 'Chinatowns' and other areas have sprung up around these dedicated buildings, creating little pockets of community.

It is those Chinatowns that Tom, now in costume and garb, is intent on visiting. The early morning sun has given way to early afternoon clouds, though rain has yet to fall, and GK leaps from roof to roof, keeping out of sight and subtly guiding his sense of perception down through the buildings he passes, down to the very roots that claw their way into the soil and stone of Millennium City's foundations. He knows what he seeks - more of the same. Drugs, guns, chemical labs where no labs ought to exist.

Things are subtler here. A laundrymat with a safe beneath a machine, housing heroine. A small room in the back of an herbal remodies store that has someone inside, but surrounding are some suspicious powders and plants, some beneath the floorboards. A few places in the sewers themselves beneath buildings that seem a cache of weapons or ill things of some kind. There's oen spesific spot that cannot be descerned because of the cluster of bodies is so thick. It's interesting that this isn't even in the chinese district, but infact near the Symphony, closer to the border into a tiny polish district and a Japanese clothing store. Other signs show themselves, because it seems that it is not completely constricted to the Chinese district, but stretching from it, like some spiderweb.

Thomas takes notes on his findings, committing each to his indelible memory. He moves with swiftness and surety, hugging what cover and concealment he can, finally dropping to street level in a disused alley and passing entirely through the street. He navigates through solid rock toward the sewers, and from there towards the weapons cache he observed. It would be troublesome to visit the street-level shops now, but this much he can do for now..

The cache is hidden beneath a pile of crusty, molded crates, barrels, and garbage. The rats and worse things that wriggle through might deter anyone from suspecting the strongbox beneath the muck and mire houses weapons. Several sub machineguns, what could be considered a miniature speargun. A few choked shotguns, and a box of 'cop killers' are the highlights of the impressive things.

After twenty minutes of intense concentration, Tom arrives at an idea. His sense of perception extends forward, focusing on the guns, analyzing them for the slightest hint of abnormality - salt water from sea-spray, the chemically-distinctive water that would hang in the air around a shipping port on the Great Lakes, wood splinters, or ingrained and embedded mud that he could track back to its source.

From the indication, there's no detection of salt. However, silt and water - hints of rust despite being cleaned before - and definetly a touch of sandstone and limeston, and limestone is only indigenous in one immediate area: Peche Island.

Peche Island. Right off of Belle Island in the Detroit River, Peche island is a beautiful, quite well located place. Yet as the black boots settle upon the clay-like dirt, peer over the weeds and trees and unchecked wilderness upon the island, no signs of civilization are present, other then overgrown foundations, or the ruined shell of a burnt house near the shore, that nature has claimed by the plants growing in its shadow, the ivy and weeds choking the husk. For Peche Island is said to be cursed by Rosaline Laforte, after being thrown off her land by some business men. A curse she layed down, so the legend says, that none shall ever live on her land. And so it has been, that none who have sought to put any inhabitance, any construction on the island has befallen misfortune; bankrupts, accidents, and other seemingly unconnected things. And from Tom's view, it seems deserted, hiding secrets in the shadows of late afternoon.

Thomas walks forward three steps before an idea hits him, and the ramifications of that idea also sink in as he looks down at his own boots. Frowning and concentrating, he continues to walk. This time, though, the boots leave no traces, for Tom is keeping himself just above the surface of the ground. His sense of perception is active, scanning for tracks, limestone, sandstone, and any other distinctive evidence of recent inhabitation. If the weapons were smuggled through this area - a deserted island, the ideal conduit - then some sort of physical evidence should be present.

There are limestone deposits beneath the surface of the island; silt, sandstone, and other river rocks cling to the island itself, the natural flows of water that drift through the sediments eating at the limestone that is the island's core. Unused caves, pockets really, are beneath the surface, but soon the island's use is discovered. Either the smugglers are superstitious, or cautious, because from what Tom can tell, there is no buildings or places where the items are housed. But just walking around the southern shore, he finds buried treasure; a foot or so beneath the surface, boxes are buried here and there, with ugly flowers poking up from the ground as their obvious markers. And as he searches further, a much more grim fact comes to light: not only is the island a point of buried contraband, but it's also a body dumping site. Bits of bone have settled into the sediments, but bodies are found in some of the limestone enclaves near the shore, not to mention beneath the surface, and inside the dense underbrush.

**Dr. Keifer.** The voice is cold and hollow, as GK emerges like a phantom from the far wall of the office. Tom has taken every precaution to avoid discovery this time, planned his approach perfectly. This time, surprise will be his, and he smiles to himself. We'll see if it's her turn to jump...

She merely straightens up from looking at a microscope. It's not so much a startled motion, but a rising up as someone enters the room. The motion seems almost natural, the woman plucking a jar from the shelf above her head as if that was her entire intention. "You know, you sound too much like death would." She turns, leaning against her desk, looking curious.

**I am the herald of death. Those who shun wisdom and continue on the path of evil must face it,** the Ghost responds dryly. **Those who kill are those who must die. In that connection,** he adds, **I have a request.** He hefts a bag, a nondescript canvas sack, which clinks and clicks. **Human jaws. Their dental records or DNA will identify them, I hope. Do this for me.** No please, no 'will you', simply the expectation of results at a suitable time in the near future.

She regards the bag and their barer with an expression of cold consideration, attempting to read him and his package. A hand reaches out, collecting it, to open and glance inside. "Someone's been digging." Bag set aside, a glance upwards. There's a look like she were to about to ask a question, then nods. "All right. When will you come back for the results?"

**How long will the analysis take? I will be back at that time.** Tom considers. We have a little bit of time before the trial, and the matter of Tia's origin must be investigated... though it's of a lower priority than certain other matters. **I do not expect instant results, Doctor. But soon.**

Opening the bag once more, she reviews the bones with a thought. "Some of these appear to be rather old. Let's see... give me five days to get them all. We've got a little surplus of activity; a fire in an apartment building, so I'm a little burnt out for time."

Thomas nods slowly. **Your discretion is appreciated,** he says curtly, then nods and turns to make for the wall, and from there, home.

"No goodbye? Come back when you need some more help - But don't be surprised when I request a little myself." She sets the bag down, and shakes her head.
