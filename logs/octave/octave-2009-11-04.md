Angelo DeGroot is in jail. It's not the first time; in his long and checkered career as a mercenary, he's been in a lot of people's jails. This one isn't so bad, as it goes; the cot is clean and there's a toilet. It's also warm, which is a good thing, since winter nights at these high latitudes are pretty brutal.

The thing that's pisses off DeGroot, though, is how he got here. A fistfight in one of the town's few good watering holes on a Friday night, with another merc who was on the other side, a few wars ago. Turns out he's a deputy marshall here. So DeGroot's stuck until the courts open on Monday, and then he's probably going to lose his ride to some bullshit plea bargain.

There's no TV in the cell; so he passes the time playing chess against himself. DeGroot can't help but feel that he's losing on both sides at the same time.

The man who enters the cell isn't a local. He walks with the calm, tight urban gait of an arcology man. One of the people who live safe beneath the domes, not out in the open air. He has the luxury of not having to look up at the stars in the night sky, of not having to think about them. He's dressed in a nice suit, with wraparound sunglasses that DeGroot is pretty sure are fully wired up. His sleeve is quietly blinking. On closer inspection, the mercenary makes out the distinctive cut of the Calculum Suitsys - a clothing computer. The visitor isn't just well-dressed.

He sits down on the good side of the bars, folds his hands together, and stares through his impenetrable shades at DeGroot. "Hey," he says. The voice is calm, practical, practiced.

DeGroot frowns. He pulls the cell's one chair around to face the bars, has a seat. "Hello," he says evenly, hiding a mild unease. The suit isn't the lawyer for anybody in this town; which means someone has taken a particular interest in DeGroot... and a jail cell doesn't make a good impression.

"You're Angelo DeGroot. Former pilot, astronaut training, EETGA and CCT certified, A-Pod certified, NUN-SEM grade 4.." The man rattles off a litany of astronautical and aeronautical qualifications. ".. And you got arrested for a bar brawl, if I understand this correctly. Is that about right?"

DeGroot nods. "Yeah, that's me. And... yeah, that's about it." He rubs the back of his head where the other merc hit him with the stunner. He thinks whether he should explain, and doesn't. It just sounds too stupid.

"Did you win?" The question is concise; there's no hint of sarcasm.

DeGroot can't help but chuckle. "I'm in jail because I won," he says. Then more seriously, "If I'd lost, they wouldn't have bothered."

The man in the suit nods slowly. "Alright. Was this a discipline problem?" His voice changes subtly; DeGroot recognizes the intent. This was the real question, and he knows that the man will be scrutinizing him very carefully indeed when he answers.

DeGroot frowns again. "Maybe for him," he says. "Not for me. No, not for me. This was... marketing." He folds his arms and rocks the chair back, perfectly steady. "He was on the other side, once. He lost then, too. Seems he's taking it personally." DeGroot shakes his head. "No matter whether I think it's right or not, if you back out of that kind of fight, word gets around."

The enigmatic man cracks a smile. "I see. Quite right, Mr. DeGroot." He leans forward, then, clasped hands pushed forward. "I'm here to offer you a job with my employer. Ten missions, just flying. The catch is that it'll be in occupied territory. Archaeology. The expedition leader will call the shots while on site, you'll be in charge of the flight crew."

DeGroot doesn't bother to hide his interest; the guy's probably wearing enough sensors to administer the Voight-Kompff test with two fingers and and a deep breath. "You've chosen an interesting time to approach me. Do I get to know who's signing the checks?"

"You will after we're out of earshot of the fuzz," the man replies. "10,000 Tn per dig site. Ten sites. I'll spring you after I get an answer, either way."

DeGroot pauses. It's an amazing amount of money; above his pay grade... but the money is a formality. Whatever is happening here, he doesn't want to jeaporadize it by asking too many questions. DeGroot lives to fly; and this is his kind of job. He nods once. "I'm in." And that's all it takes; whatever plans he had yesterday, this is his life now. DeGroot stays bought.

"Good." The man stands up. "So officially the charges are being dropped due to lack of evidence. Unofficially there's a bomb on the D-Engine that keeps this town lit up and warm, and the next technician that comes out here to fix it will get a few rounds of depleted uranium through his truck's A-Pods. So everyone here will be real happy to see you go."

DeGroot takes a moment to understand this; it's really heavy-handed, to spring one merc. Whoever these guys are, they take care of their allies. _Better with them, then,_ he thinks, and stands up. "I'm happy to oblige them," he says. "I, uh... don't need to pack."

"That's fine." He pauses. "We didn't want things to get to this point, you understand. Money would have been fine. You were right - someone decided to make this personal. So we got personal." He smiles again, reaches for his pocket, extends a business card. "Call me for pickup when you're out. Shouldn't take long. I've got to make a few other calls first." With that he waves and departs.

DeGroot accepts the card; the only markings are BLAKE, and a comm code. The other man is gone almost before he looks up again. _Personal._ More is going on here than DeGroot knows about. That's not new, but it seems to have a little more to do with him than usual. Whatever; he folds and pockets the chessboard. A bigger game is afoot now.
