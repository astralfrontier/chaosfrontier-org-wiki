# FUTILE OCTAVE 2009-11-28

Chicago is loud - noise in every sense pervades the arcology. Bright colors, noisy sound, the sterilized smell of city life competing with the organic aroma of poverty and the choking black miasma of industry's darker half. The sky above is a carefully filtered and screened view onto the world. They don't let you look at the stars at night, unless you're a professional astronomer. Geometrically perfect cloud formations and an idealized moonlight ambiance are all you get.

There's a designated meeting place for the sort of business Klein has found himself in. It's a park bench, 35 minutes before the city curfew, in one of the many open parks that dot the arcology. Klein waits there for his contact, staring up at that digitally fabricated moon, and his ears make out the hushed sounds of a city trying to ease itself past dreaming and into comforting unconsciousness.

Klein tries to make geomotric sense of the clouds

Klein's contact is named Uncle Gus. His face is withered and ashen, and his hair has gone past gray and into a sort of industrial white. Uncle Gus is tapping his walking stick as he finds his way through the park. He sits down heavily next to Klein, smiles, waves. The Egyptian Eye of Horus is tattooed on the backs of his hands. "Good evenin'," he murmurs.

Klein says, "Evening Gus. How's business?"

Klein leans back and casually surveys the other side of the street

"Business is fine." Gus wheezes, reaching down to scratch at his knee through the fabric of his suit. "I've got something for you. Dangerous. Pays well. Needs your personal attention." He slips a hand into a pocket, withdraws a small data disc and hands it over.

Klein shakes Uncle Gus's hand and palms the disk with practiced ease. "I'll give it my full attention, thanks"

Klein the disk dissaperas into a pocket and asks with real concern "You have that cough looked at?"

The old man nods. Rising to his feet with the aid of his cane, he shows yellowed teeth through a wide grin. "Now take care of y'self." Waving goodbye, he strolls away.

Klein waits a few moments then stands and heads theother direction, wondering if this is more Eastern European badness.

Klein has always been gregarious and driven and didn't waste time sulking over how the last evac out of The Storm went. Finding a night shift as a bartender and enrolling in a few refreshser courses at the University he keeps busy.

Klein was always up late though. He just didn't sleep well. No, it's nothing like those guys with the night terrors or the fools that couldn't sleep for fear of being watched by an unblinking eye from an alien dimension.

Klein.At least that is what he told Farrel back when they were still speaking.

Klein would stay up late going over files she couldn't see or doing course work or even playing video games, enventually gettign a few hours nap until the morning when over a groggy bowl of cereal he got to listen to her theories. Soemtimes it was that he suffored from PTSD or melanine deficit or that The Storm had left physcic trauma on his liver. Yeah, yeah..

Klein watched her leave, like the others. Another relationship that started but didn't realy set. He used to think it was the job; with the deployments and 'need to know'. But lately some doubt was creeping in that maybe a big portion of him wasn't letting people in even when it was being social. The thoughts come and go, but there is work to be done so Steven pushes the thoughts back and brings up another tome on his PDA.

Klein has been studing magical theory since he was 18, so pretty much a late bloomer. Having been 'selected' for training he dove into it. The languages and spell craft were a challenge and interesting, plus they told him he was doing something important for mankind.

Klein taps a few more lines onto the PDA then waits while it chugs through a non-euclidian laPlace Transform. The light coming in fromt he street dims and a breeze pushes his bedroom door closed. A moment later the screen displays the white rune of warding. Part grimore, part amulate, and part power focus, no modern mage should be without his PDA and you can tell those that have actually seen some shit by how well they protect theirs.

Klein pockets the device and looks at the unmade bed. Feeling tired now, but just a bit more to do so he heads to the kitchen for a soda and the box of rock salt. A couple slugs of cola and he's ready to realign the power lines on his floor. The ritual is rutine but requires patience and Steven likes to maintain the sanctified room nightly.

Klein corrects the salt lines where needed. Though considering what he was just reading, there may be a way to increast the power node by inscribing a Westing Gate in the North East. Nothing to be done now, but maybe something to toy with tomorrow night if the bar is quiet.

quiet

He's worked at the Falcoln and Ferret for about 6 weeks, started jsut after he got back. Not so much for the money (the pay out was good even though no one wants to talk about how the mission ended) but it fullfills Steve's need for comraderie. Plus he actually felt drawn to the place that first night. Deep wooden counter tops, cheesy animal heads hanging on the wall from a past age. It jsut felt like a home he'd bee wanting. Plus it gets mostly hard working locals. Poeple from the dock, occasioally the lift terminal.

Bars, boardrooms, battlefields. Klein's seen all three at some distance. Reading over this new work makes him suspect that he may see them again, and soon. A company called Starkweather Solutions is sending archaeologists to the four corners of the earth. Ten dangerous digs in territory occupied by the Migou. And there's something else, too, something the job offer discusses but doesn't describe. Something called "FUTILE OCTAVE".

There's something else with the data disc as well, a small wrapped package that came with it. Klein understands what it is when he reads Uncle Gus' personal note attached to the job offer: "use it if you need it, but only if you need it." It's a suicide capsule, to be swallowed under unknown and perhaps unknowable circumstances. What sort of job is this, if death is the better option?
