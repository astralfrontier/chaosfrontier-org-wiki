# FUTILE OCTAVE 2010-01-09

The Starkweather conference room in Chicago is well-lit, white, spartan. Holographics are set up to provide a presentation. About thirty people are present here, seated in the comfortable folding chairs that mechanically adjust themselves to their user's posture. The crowd is a mix of human and Nazzadi, European and Asian and African and elsewhere. Once everyone who's hungry has gone for coffee and pastries and has seated themselves, the presenter - a Mr. Blake, according to his nametag - begins to speak.

"Ilya Muromets. Possibly a fusion of several historical figures, dating anywhere from the 10th century to the 15th. Reputedly couldn't walk until age 33 - the supposed age of Christ during His ministry - and was given some sort of superhuman infusion by a giant, called Svyatogor. He went off to save Kiev, fought monsters, fought the Mongol invasion, and uh, apparently once broke off all the church steeples in the city for being snubbed at a dinner party."

Historical images - paintings, photographs of statuary and cathedrals - drift pass on the holographic screens.

"In 1482, the Tatars - a Turkish ethnic group - raided the Monastery of the Caves in Kiev, the 'Kiev Pechersk lavra'. A hundred years ago, the bones of someone supposed to be Ilya Muromets were found buried in the cave system that gives the monastery its name. Monks went down there to hide out from the Tatars, who would ride in, take their stuff, destroy the rest, and ride out. Muromets supposedly died of stab wounds, and according to local legend, angels had actually carried him from his place of death right into the caves themselves."

A map of the monastery and its grounds, including a fairly detailed map of the cave system, springs into view on the screens.

"The NEG found all kinds of things in Istanbul, buried and ancient. Old texts, prayers, whatever. The Ashcroft Foundation scanned them in and put them up on their network. Some of them have made their way out. Like this little gem here. This is written in Ukrainian Church Slavonic. The language of the eastern Orthodox churches."

"The English translation of this particular passage is what interests us. 'In the clouded recesses of Demhe the coffin of my friend Svyatogor still rests. Upon the distant thrones of Carcosa the spirit of my friend Svyatogor still sits.' Now it's interesting because these names are, well, relevant to out there. The thrones in question would be on a planet somewhere near Aldebaran. Not really the usual stomping grounds of a Russian hero."

"The bones were interred in the caves with the greatest respect. To our knowledge they've never been violated and the whole site has been a historically significant monument for a couple centuries now. If there's anything - anything at all - that's relevant to the war on that site, we need to find it and decipher it."

"NEG military intelligence tells us that Kiev is still standing, although it's on the border of Migou territory. Expect it to be pretty heavily patrolled by the armed forces. You'll be going as legitimate archaeologists - because you are - but be careful. Juneau hit everyone pretty hard."

Jamie raises her hand, looking about the room to see if anyone else is confused. She turns her head, "Um.. Mr Blake.. Juneau?" She asks.

Most everyone else seems to be nodding along. After a moment, Jamie sees the correlation. The black-as-night Nazzadi faces in the crowd, and a few with foreign complexions - as well as a handful of Caucasians - all these seem less impacted than the others. Those who are nodding somberly along with Blake's pronouncement are Americans.

Blake explains. "You see, with a few exceptions, nobody's ever really invaded American soil successfully. It's.. sort of a shock, like that series of terrorist attacks a century ago. And to be so thoroughly routed, well... Anyway, enough of the bad news."

Jamie withdraws her hand, and looks around, a slight blush to her cheeks, but she nods.

Blake steps away, taking a seat off to the side of the room. A brown-haired and bearded man rises from his chair to speak in his place. "I'm Dr. Armitage, Cornelius Armitage, and ah, it's a pleasure to meet those of you who have just joined us as friends. Many of you I have worked with before, or have met. I will be heading up the missions we have. With me are Doctors, ah, Bowen, Ling, and Short." He gestures to the audience; one human man and two women (one human, one Nazzadi) raise their hands or nod in acknowledgement.

"For Kiev, we've evaluated the risks and our crew complement. Assignments are as follows. The _Moore_ will be stationkeeping well outside of Kiev. It'll perform long-range monitoring. Ah, one shuttle will enter Kiev airspace and touch down near the lavra. Dr. Bowen will be in charge of the investigation. Mr. DeGroot, Mr. Tran, you will be primary and backup pilots. Mr. Latham, Ms. Solak, and Mr. Albez will assist him."

"Dr. Bowen, ah, speaks Russian fluently. For those that do not, translation software is available for your PCPUs and will be provided in realtime by the shuttle's computer."

Blake retakes center stage. "Standby crew on _Moore_: Rice, Naza, Kova, Ebony, La, McTavish, Pierce, Suka-Ha. Two pilots will be on emergency standby during the Kiev trip, everyone else is on 8-hour watch duty. Mr. DeGroot will be managing watch schedules, Mr. Rice will sub in while he's on mission."

"Are there any questions?"

One of the Nazzadi - Kova, or Frank according to his file - raises his hand and asks his question in crisply accented English. "Very well, what are the conditions in this Ukraine? It is near the border of Migou territory." Blake nods, stepping forward to address this. "The NEG is sending reinforcements to Europe. We've heard of heavy fighting on the Migou front but the line is holding. That's according to intelligence from two days ago. Our man doesn't expect that to change."

With no other questions, the conference dismisses.

The _Jeremiah Moore_ is a winged craft 160 feet in length, slightly shorter than the jet airliners of a century ago but much thicker. Its wings are for stabilization, not lift - the A-Pod units attached to the hull handle keeping it aloft and pushing it forward. The twin D-Engines at the heart of the ship power everything, including a comprehensive life support system. As a result, the _Moore_ is less of a vehicle and more of a mobile base. The Starkweather crew find it nestled inside a hangar in the Rockford Aerospace Hub, a short bus ride from the corporate headquarters.

The crew boards in ones and twos, a few waving to or hugging family and friends who've come to see them off. DeGroot and the other pilots divide themselves into two groups: one to check themselves out in the four-seat cockpit, the other to settle into their accommodations while they wait their turn. The controls are the familar ARINC 881 holographics and the Limited AI system performs flawlessly during preflight checks.

Fourteen cabins holding two people each, plus a briefing room, sickbay and cockpit provide living areas for the crew. The cabins are designed with rollaway soundproofed partitions that can be opened up to provide a commons area for meals and the like. Eight duty stations would be manned if the craft was at full capacity and on a wartime footing; as it stands, the watch rotation is pretty light, and the ship's LAI will automate several tasks.

"Lovely ship," DeGroot comments. "All the comforts of home, and armor-plated." He frowns, though, as he waves a hand through a hologram of the hull. "ALMOST armor-plated, anyway. So we'll run before we fight."

A flight plan has been filed: transit to Paris, scheduled to coincide with the New Earth Government's carrier _Victory_ and her battlegroup heading to Europe. Once the _Moore_ is in Paris, the crew will file another flight plan based on better local intelligence regarding Migou activity.

The launch is uneventful. _Moore_ rendezvouses with several other crafted also intent on flying under the aegis of the formidable _Victory_. The NEG battlegroup flies just under the clouds, high enough to make spotting difficult from the sea and out of visual inspection from space. From their portholes, the crew can see the dim fires burning in the gutted remnants of Old New York's skyscrapers. Sometimes lines in the dark, brief flares of illumination, show the exchange of gunfire between buildings and on the streets. A pall of black smoke hangs over the city.

The American continent is gone almost too fast. Then comes the Atlantic Ocean - the endless stretches of black that occasionally sparkle with reflected moonlight. Sometimes there are phosphorescent glitters of light reminiscent of stars, but those take on a more worrisome cast when it's noted that the clouds are blocking the starlight from reaching such patches.

The battlegroup maintains radio silence. A few spotting drones fly well ahead, relaying their telemetry back via laser. The airships use signal lamps to speak to each other, and even that is done sparingly. But in due course, the French coastline is sighted.

Jamie stares out of the porthole, having never left the USA before. She tries to hide her excitement, but she's taking it all in, as if a vacation instead of the somber reminder of war.

The NEG and its civilian hangers-on take their leave of each other outside of Paris. One by one, the civilian craft also peel away from each other. The radio crackles to life, feeding landing details to the _Moore_. DeGroot and Rice, the acting pilots at the time, review and approve. A crack in the eggshell of the Paris arcology opens; the _Moore_ flies through it. A private dock's doors slide open to admit the vehicle, and it settles in. Everyone feels a slight shudder through the deck and the distant hiss of waldoes. They've landed.

Nathan has been feeling vaguely uneasy, and the feeling has only increased when landfall in Paris is announced. If anyone had asked him why, he would've waved it off as nervousness, or perhaps the perfectly reasonable dread of the Migou, but in fact those don't feel like the right answers. He can't put his finger on what the right answer _is_... and oddly enough, _that_ doesn't worry him very much.

DeGroot feels the D-Engines spinning down, and sighs. "From one tin can to the next."

Jamie looks up from her PCPU, and looks about, "Anyone know how long we're on the ground here?"

Albez and Tran are muttering at each other in French as the crew disembarks along the gangplank. Drs. Armitage and Bowen are similarly in quiet discussion, but in English. McTavish has lit up a joint and is casually smoking it as he hauls his bag. Dr. Short, hearing Jamie, speaks up. "We'll be talking to our guy here, a Mr. Kelvin. We'll probably be departing in two days' time. Stay ready to go."

Jamie drifts down the gangplank straggling a bit behind the others, vaguley following the crowd as she looks about herself. Her feet carry her to the edge of the private dock, and through the building.

DeGroot approaches Doctor Armitage. "You think you might want some backup?" He tries to put it casually; like academics always take armed thugs to meetings.

"Yes, by all means," agrees Armitage. "You should talk to Kelvin anyway."

---

Adrian Kelvin isn't at the Starkweather office - he's actually come down to the port to meet the _Moore_ as it came in, and Armitage and the others find him in the terminal. They secure a private booth at the neon-lit local restaurant just outside the port, and Kelvin starts distributing data files.

Drinks are ordered, a few minutes of genial exchanges are passed around the table, but the crew can feel a distinct tension. Finally Kelvin gets down to business.

"Your approach. The Dnieper River flows from the Valdai Hills in Russia, through Belarus and south to the Ukraine. Ultimately it empties out into the Black Sea. There have been few reports of activity from the Esoteric Order of Dagon in the area. The waters of the Black Sea are anoxic at lower depths, limiting Deep One efforts at infiltration."

"I think for this reason that you should fly to a port on the Black Sea itself, then use the river to reach Kiev. This will avoid Migou flyovers, but also the NEG. There is something very strange going on with them."

"Strange?" DeGroot says. "You mean the NEG forces, or the civvies?"

Kelvin shrugs. "The New Earth Government forces are actually... not going to Ukraine, you see," he explains. "They are going to Belarus. They are going to Varna. But they are not going to where the fighting is supposed to be happening. And I have obtained, at some risk, various reports which say that the Engel Project has assigned some of its units, but I haven't seen any sign that they have come through Paris."

"So we're rushing in where the NEG fears to tread?" asks Nathan.

Kelvin fingers his coffee cup tepidly, starts to take a drink, hesitates. "The most probable explanation is that they are preparing a pincer movement for something on the Russian-Ukrainian border. That is what my sources believe. But they have not been told either."

Jamie thinks for a moment, "But, if the pincer succeeds... they'll be running right for us."

DeGroot takes this in, and looks around the table. Armitage is here, along with two of the archaeologists; that leaves military matters to DeGroot. He decides to bring up an idea he's had. "Mister Kelvin, the Moore is no battleship. If we get into a crossfire it will go badly for us. Can you point us at some ECM?"

"Our budget is 1.5 million, Mr. DeGroot," Armitage says quietly. Kelvin nods. "Weapons, stealth, I have computed this already. One of our systems would cost six times that amount. Nor can we easily account for it. However, the hangar you're in is equipped for refits. If you can secure something through ah, less official channels - and not through me, please - then I think we can install it."

"Probably easier to just get it from someone who doesn't need it anymore," mutters Nathan under his breath.

Kelvin smiles. "The good news is that your ah, special cargo compartments are being loaded with some interesting goodies. Please do not open until Christmas, or Doomsday."

Degroot grins; these kids are sharper than he expected. "Well. Let's see what we can find, then."

---

Jamie looks through her PCPU, and then glances up on the way back. "I think McTavish or Albez would, either one, be a good place to start." THe says, with little explination behind it...

Jamie adds, "Also Dr. Short was looking at the radios on the ship a lot during the flight..."

Armitage leaves this matter to the people who seem more knowledgeable about it - Messrs. DeGroot, Latham and Solak. And with that, they approach each of their fellow crewmates.

Dr. Short seems rather reluctant, but a bit of persuasion convinces her of the importance of the project. "I don't actually know where to find these supplies," the Nazzadi woman admits. "But I have some experience with their operation. So, if you are able to impregnate the ship with a device, I will do what I can do."

McTavish seems rather surly when asked. "Are you mad? These Parisian ponces wouldn't know a jammer from toast on jam. And I am sure as bloody Hades not raiding the NEG's supplies, no boy. I'm sorry but I don't think I can help with this. But good luck, and don't get your keisters blown off."

Albez gives the best early results. "I can find people. But it will take five days," is how his translator renders his husky French. "I can't install it. You need someone else's skills. Can we delay the launch for this?"

"Up to Armitage," DeGroot says. "But we can find installers. Get started on it."

In the end, Dr. Armitage doesn't veto the plan, but he does express some reservations. "This better be worth it," he says darkly, as he and DeGroot conclude their short conversation on the matter.

The next night, Albez has come back to report. "I have found a man," he says via translation. "One million Terranotes. He says it is energy gear." The software corrects itself after a moment. "N.E.G. It is functional but badly damaged. If we are hit, it will probably stop working after a short time."

DeGroot shakes his head. "I don't think the bosses will write the check for that. But it was worth a try. Let's move on."

---

Armitage consults with DeGroot. "Alright. Kiev it is. I'll depend on your discretion and judgement for the approach." And on small groups or singly the crew begin to filter back on board. A few items have disappeared from the ship's stores; a few new ones have unaccountably been brought aboard. Some alcohol and a few girls need to be excised from the crew cabins' bunkbeds and disposed of. And in due course, the _Moore_ is ready to fly again.

DeGroot files his flight plan - Paris to Odessa. The _Moore_ launches without incident. Eastern Europe awaits.

Odessa is already in sight when DeGroot springs his surprise. A reauthorization request that will have to be relayed back to Paris is attached to his latest message to air traffic control. The _Moore_ is already submerged and winding its way up the Dnieper when the reply is processed. It's no longer a live radio channel, of course, just a general broadcast: "Jeremiah Moore, you are ordered to turn back and report to Varna, by order of New Earth Government military control."

"Oh, hell, already?" DeGroot mutters. "Alright. Get Doctor Armitage up here, he's got to know about this. Otherwise..." He loads the flight plan he's been working on for the last hour. "We're a hole in the water." The big ship descends and gets perceptibly quieter; DeGroot knows how to hide.

The response comes in from Paris, relayed from Odessa: "Odessa, this is Starkweather Solutions, Adrian Kelvin. Jeremiah Moore is en route to recover and remove an archaeological team that has been on site for quite some time." "Starkweather, Odessa copies. Our records don't show any previous flight plans filed from your company for that region." "Odessa, Starkweather - they arrived on another transport. I'll relay your request for records to our American headquarters, but they'll all be asleep now." "Starkweather, Odessa acknowledges. Moore is not responding to our calls. N.E.G. forces are authorized to shoot them down if they don't acknowledge a hail. Out."

Kiev is close. The _Moore_ rises out of the water in a stately ascent; the river parts to admit it back into the sky, and rivulets pour back into the river water from the myriad nooks and crannies of the vessel.

DeGroot and Tran are on the duty roster for piloting; accordingly, the call to mobilize goes out. _Siberia_ is prepped and ready in its hangar, a narrow cigar-shaped craft that clings to its mother vessel. Dr. Bowen, Latham, Solak, and Albez make up the rest of the six-seater's crew.

Jamie starts to get those assigned to the shuttle detail together, "You heard the captian, let's get loaded up so we can make a stately turd on the landscape as we're jettesoned out..." She rouses anyone from their cabins who may need it, helping make sure equipment was loaded corrrectly.

But as the _Moore_ drifts over Kiev airspace, they see something they didn't expect - that nobody expected. The destroyed shells of high rises, the caved-in roofs of buildings, the gouges and cracks in pavement. The city isn't merely a battle zone. It has been destroyed. Not one part of it lies intact, in any direction. Out to the horizon, the city of Kiev is a corpse.

DeGroot puts the dismal view up on the shuttle's holo. "That didn't happen in a day," He says. "So how long has it been like this? Doctor Bowen? Any ideas?"

Dr. Bowen, strapping himself in, shakes his head. His eyes are empty, and his fingers fumble at the latches for a moment. "N-no. I... I can't imagine. But it looks like .. there's been fighting for awhile, yeah?" His lips tighten in resolve. "Still. We have a job to do, gentlemen. Let's do it the best we're able."

"No wonder the NEG ordered us to turn back," DeGroot says. "No way they'll belive this is an extraction." He straps himself into the control throne. "OK. Let's do this, and have it done with."

The _Moore_ jettisons its shuttle well before the city boundary, and heads back for the river. A shuddering in the hull marks the unlocked clamps that held the two vessels, and a sudden queasiness in the stomach marks a change in course. The _Siberia_ and its six passengers are on their own, flying low over a smoking and decimated shell of a city.
