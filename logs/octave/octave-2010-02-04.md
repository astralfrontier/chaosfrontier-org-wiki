# FUTILE OCTAVE 2010-02-04

Starkweather's corporate HQ has been busy. A buyer has been found for the armor and the cup, found at the Carpathian dig site. The buyer's name and an Italian office address have been sent to Jamie Solak via private communication aboard the _Jeremiah Moore_, along with an authorization for Jamie - and nobody else - to transport the artifacts to Rome.

An even more private communication from the Eldritch Society explains. The buyer is an import/export business that has dealt with Harold & Marks Ventures in the past, and will almost certainly deal with them now. As the Starkweather expedition is a private enterprise, they're free to sell any pieces they discover to anyone they like. The Ashcroft Foundation has standing purchase orders for such artifacts, of course. But the Ashcroft Foundation hasn't been implicated in a Migou black operation.

Jamie carefully adjusts her PCPU to make sure the Starkweather email is up and visible. She approaches Dr. Armitage, "Si- er Doctor. I will need to take these." She states, tersely.

A demolition bomb going off in the archaeologist's cabin couldn't have upset the man more, but he does manage to finish reading the message. "Well.. ahh.. we haven't finished even studying them! This is outrageous. I want you to call them back and confirm this. And CC me!"

Jamie looks down at the PCPU, then back up at the Doctor. "I'm am sure that the instructions are clear." Jamie looks around for Armitage's PCPU or computer or whatever, assuming the archaeologist would have recieved an email as well.

"Not here," Armitage replies testily, misinterpreting Jamie's interest. "In your own cabin. Now get out!"

Jamie hmms for a bit, looking at Armitage for a time, before shrugging, "I won't be gone long, I expect." She says. She steps out of the cabin, and lingers in the hallway, typing a terse message back to Starkweather, CCing Armitage as requested.

Adrian Kelvin, the company's man in Paris, comes back with a short reply. "ATTN Armitage. Transfer approved by Hu-san in Japanese office. Discussion closed."

Jamie, who hasn't moved from outside the Cabin, is rapping back on the man's door almost as soon as the email comes back in. "Sir. Doctor. I need to fulfill this..."

Armitage has received his own copy. He lets out a long sigh. "Fine. Just be careful with them. They're priceless. Of course, whoever's buying probably disagrees with that assessment." He fixes Jamie with a long stare. "Have you ever been to our Japanese office?"

Jamie looks straight back at Dr. Armitage. "No sir." She says, shortly. She turns, to go collect the items, she turns back, "We should probably start heading for Italy." She purposfully walks back to her cabin.

"Italy's not on the destination," Armitage calls. "Use a shuttle."

Jamie pauses. "As you wish." She states, tersly. She heads back to her cabin, and quickly equips herself, leaving behind the HUD glasses, and any communication equipment, as it can surely be tracable. SHe heads over to the cargo hold, to collect the prize.

Jamie collects the items, and heads to a shuttle. She's seen these worked before. She tightly secures the two object in the aft, then climbs in, programming the comptuer to take her to the Rome spaceport.

The Limited AI system on board the shuttle understands such operations well enough. It transmits an automated clearance request to the _Moore_'s bridge, attaching the original authorization message. The pilot on duty complies; the shuttle detaches from its parent craft. The nose eases over, and gently picks up speed.

Jamie's fingers roll inexpertly over the keypad of the shuttle's computer, trying to make heads or tails of the security and encyption equipment. Unfortunately, as with most of her training, it's all greek to her. She ponders for a second, and decides instead the fire off a short email in response to the second one she got, asking if she has a specific contact on the ground.

A response comes shortly. "Meeting will be arranged. Starkweather contact & buyer. Tail buyer away from meet site. Location & time to follow."

The shuttle rolls and pitches gently, steering its way through human-controlled airspace, following the invisible tendrils of navigational radio pulling it toward civilization's remaining hubs. Once during the flight, a burst of incoming audio is heard over the speakers. It's a droning, wordless series of raspy sounds that to Jamie's ears sound like a bass-enhanced voice. It lasts only twenty-three seconds and is not repeated.

Jamie quickly presses a few keys on the keyboard, trying to get the shuttle to record the message. She muses on this for a bit, while transfering the message to her PCPU.

The city of Rome has been rebuilt into something of an arcology - where once the seven hills of Rome dominated the city, now the seven defense towers do so, supporting a beautiful translucent shell whose multicolored hues form artistic patterns in the classical style.

Through the shell, the tall black bastions of the Vatican are visible. The Holy See has become an impregnable fortress. Their pointed spirals stretch to the very limits of the city's dome. Jamie can see small specks floating about them - A-Pod craft belonging to the Swiss Guard, patrolling its airspace.

Entrance to Rome's airspace is permitted. Unlike Paris, where the arcology dome itself opened to admit the _Moore_, Rome allows flying craft in and out via a large airlock arrangement near the base of the city's dome. The shuttle lines itself up accordingly and flits through the security sweep. It sets down in the hangar assigned to it by air traffic control. The hatch opens, and Jamie is in Rome.

A few boring hours pass in the shuttle. Finally a message does arrive. "Cordoba Restaurant, 34 Fezi, Rome. 5pm." Two hours from now. "Items to be delivered in person to Starkweather office in Rome meanwhile - they are on will-call with the buyer."

Jamie first carefully packs up the items, and calls for a transport across town to the Starkweather office. Assuming that the items are safely delivered to Starkweather, and she has free reign, she will Take transport down near the resturaunt, and scope the general area out.

Rome's mass transit system is entirely under 'ground' - sandwiched between layers of the arcology's multilevel grandeur. This seems mostly an aesthetic choice, as getting from station to station is a bit cumbersome.

Jamie finds that her usual credentials have been associated with an all-day pass in the underground. There's no charge, and more importantly no convenient audit trail. As long as she isn't physically followed, everything is comfortably anonymous.

The Via Fazzi seems to be the street that Jamie wants. Whoever sent her the address needs to check their spelling. Nevertheless, there is indeed a small bistro at the address in question. Jamie secludes herself nearby, watching unobtrusively.

The street seems to just be picking up for dinner, and Jamie has yet more free time on her hands. She idly walks down the sidewalk, her eyes watching, shifting, waiting to see. She perks up in interest at anyone who stops at Cordoba, making mental notes of who gets out of what for the resturaunt.

Jamie finds a nice little clotheir next door, deciding that normal work clothes probably won't do. She buys herself a nice black, conservitively cut dress, and a small black clutch. Changing in the boutique, she'll stash her grubby clothes in the alley, and resume her vigil on the resturaunt.

The crowd begins to thicken as dusk approaches. Jamie's information was correct. Around five, she overhears a man asking for a reservation in the name of Starkweather. The maitre'd smiles unctuously and directs him to the back of the establishment.

Jamie wanders up to the maitre'd after a short time, "Is there a table open by the front? I've just got in to youre beautiful city, and I want to watch the street." She smiles brightly.

"Yes, I think we can accommodate you," the man replies after consulting his tables. "Follow me please." He leads the way to a small table with two seats, right near the fence that divides the establishment from the street.

Jamie smiles and looks down, "Yes, this will be perfect!" She exclaims, all the while playing the happy tourist. SHe sits down, her head craning around, getting a feel for the place.

Brightly-garbed tourists mingle with Rome's denizens. Here a Hasidic Jew is arguing with a computer repair salesman plying his trade out of a wooden cart. There a mother and her child stare at passersby as they thread their slow path from store to store, apparently soliciting work. Three monks - garbed and tonsured as they are, they can't be anything else - pass on the street. Their chanting is in a foreign tongue, but Jamie is quite confident that they aren't intoning prayers in Latin, nor quite to whom they direct their piety.

In due course a woman has come to the restaurant, and the maitre'd again directs her to the back. She's Nazzadi and attractive enough, wearing what for her species is a starkly conservative dress suit.

Jamie again makes note of the woman's appearence. She looks, even smiling, before looking back down at her salad, picking at the lettuce daintily, her eyes wandering over all the sights presented to her. She places a fingertip along teh rim of the plate as she hears the chanting.

Jamie conducts the usual business transaction with the waitress, asking with a polite smile, "Is there anywhere around to go dancing?" She smiles, waiting for a response before she stands, and takes back to the street.

Jamie taps some terse instructions in her PCPU as she is exited, 'SPec of buyer?' in response to the other email. At least this way she'll be shadowing the right person.

A response is quickly forthcoming. "Unknown. SW contact is male human." A photo is attached - the man who arrived first.

Jamie types a quick response. "Buyer is nazz female. Pic when avail."

Eventually the two businesspeople leave the restaurant. But they leave together, and they're still walking together - swaying ever so slightly, indicating a more than convivial consumption of alcohol - as they head for the underground station.

Jamie does make a note of the couple, having found a bench to loiter in. She's a little sad noone complimented her new dress, and thinks about taking it back before the couple emerges. She holds up her PCPU, and tries to snap a quick picture, before she starts off down the street. Walking to catch up just a a bit, heading for the tube.

It's easy enough to trace the pair through the underground. The Starkweather man shows a reckless chivalry to his companion, admitting her through the checkpoint with his own pass. It's a short ride to the Hotel Olympus - a monumental high-rise that dominates the southern skyline of the city. The couple enter together.

Jamie has pretty good luck following the pair through the tube system, and to the iconic hotel. She trapes up the stairs, but manages to get hung up ina throng of people as the pair goes on ahead. She presses her way through, trying not to make too much commotion, but she gets into the hotel too late, and the couple are already on their way to the lifts.

Jamie runs over, trying to make it into the same lift. She manages to stop just as the doors are closing. SHe watches the elevator goe up, making a note of what floor or floors it stops on.

Jamie's eyes follow the holographic indicator. The lift stops on three floors.

Jamie sighs, and takes a seat on one of the chairs in the lobby, facing the elevators. Her eyes dart from her PCPU to the elevators as she types out a message. "SW and Buyer in bed. Pic attached. One of these floors in the Hotel Olympus." ANd flings the message off.

A reply returns in due course. "Pics not of them in bed. Don't be so prude. Can you access hotel comm records? Incoming/outgoing calls?"

Jamie storms up to the front desk, frasslign her hair out as she does so. "Which room is he in?" She does her best to look mad as hell. "I sware to god I'm going to hurt someone today, and if I can't find him, I don't know who it will be." She looks at the poor guy behind the counter. "I wonder how long he's had this little number." She speaks out loud.

The clerk looks up. "Ma'am?" he asks, puzzled. "How may I be of assistance?" Notably, his voice is pitched at a lower volume, as a not so subtle hint.

Jamie isn't in the mood for subtile hints. She brings up the picture of the guy on her PCPU. "This guy just came in here with a 'friend.' She alsmost spits as she says this last. "I need to know what room they're in, or I just may do something crazy." Again, a pointed look at the clerk."

"I see." The clerk composes himself, smiling carefully. "Perhaps madam would like to speak to the manager." His smile holds itself pitch-perfect for a few moments, then begins to fade. Worry starts to creep onto his face. The manager is either busy, or something else has happened. "While he's on his way, perhaps.. I can assist you."

Jamie smiles, and puts away the PCPU she had been weilding as if it could hurt someone. "Excellent." She says. Still not loosing the livid look.

There's a brief flash. The hotel's imaging system has captured the image that Jamie held up. "I will be happy to send a message to the gentleman's room on your behalf?"

Jamie shakes her head, "No no no. You don't understand. I've played nicey nice with this man for far too long." She sighs, "I'm really going to hurt him, this time." She shakes her head, and begins to storm off, then she turns back. Her knuckles whiten as she looks across at the poor kid, "Perhaps you could ring his room for me?"

"Ah - of course, madam." The clerk gestures to one wall. "Our courtesy phones. I'll connect you on #2 in a moment."

Jamie nods, and storms away to the bank of phones on the wall.

The clerk discreetly begins working on his console. Jamie knows she's been made. She got a number - room 1826 - but the clerk is on to her game.

Jamie shrugs, and waves to the clerk, "I hope he has fun." She shakes her head, and walks out of the building.

Jamie wanders off the the side of the building. They said in class that it was usually a grey box... There. She spots what might be her entry point.

Jamie swaps her clothes back into her 'normal' outfit, as she taps some keys on the telco box. "1 7 2 8..." she mutters to herself, the mantra they gave her in class. She pulls out her PCPU, and links the two, quickly tapping out some commands for the security system.

Jamie loiters around the outside of the hotel and manages to catch a small group entering the hotel. She slides up into the group, and walks her way in, not creaping like a theif, but rather strolling in, and over to the elevator cluster again.

"Hold that lift please!" calls the desk clerk from earlier - he's been wary since Jamie's tantrum, and now he's spotted her. But Jamie realizes something important. If he has to ask for the elevator to be stopped, he can't do it himself.

Jamie pushes the close button, holding it with a smile on her face. She finds the right button, and holds it in. She shrugs to the gentleman who got in the lift with her, "I don't think he meant us." And pushes the button for her floor.

The man tips his hat sardonically, his fine Egyptian features betraying a slight conspiratorial smirk at the remark.

As the doors open to her floor, she smiles, and nods at the man again.. Exiting, she walks intently down the hall. Surely security will be after her again. But this will probably be her last chance to make it. She finds the room.

Jamie pulls out her PCPU again, and taps on the device, waving it past the lock on the door, to try and gain entry.

Jamie whispers a curse under her breath, and continues to walk down the hall, looking for a utility closet or something of that nature.

Jamie tries her little trick with her handheld again, and again to no avail. She curses again under her breath, and glances nerviously down the hall. She rolls her eyes, and makes her way to the other side of the building from where the room is, waiting for security to make their way there. She'll also page the elevator on her way by.

Jamie can see the lift already heading up - probably with a security man. She has maybe 15 more seconds.

Jamie darts out of the way, making for the wrong wing of the building, ducking into one of the side corridors, and listening for security to get off the lift.

A plainclothes man steps out. He glances about, then makes his way down the corridor. He stops at 1826 a moment, listens, then uses a pass-key to open the room next to it and steps in.

Jamie sees her chance, and doesn't want to miss it. She steps back out into the main hallway, and boards the elevator. She chooses floor 17, and patiently rides down.

There's probably more men on the way up. The lift continues down to the ground floor the moment Jamie steps out.

Jamie walks briskly down the corridor, and darts into one of the halls. SHe goes to the same place she found the utility closet before, and starts, again, to try and gain enterance.

Jamie pulls out her PCPU again, just trying to breech the closet. She fails once, but the second time she passes over the lock, it clicks slightly, and she manages to get in. She looks around, trying to find a lead into the system.

Time passes. Room 1826 makes an internal call for room service.

Around 2 a.m. the furor has died down. Jamie did intercept a call to 1828 - the next room over, where the security man stopped in. The desk clerk has called up. The security man reports nothing. "I looked her up," the clerk confides. "Some girl working for the same company as that fellow. Probably jealous that he's off boffing some darkie bint instead of her. Call it off."

Now, however, there's a call from 1826 itself.

The call is to Lisbon. The outgoing line includes voice and audio. The external feed is audio only. The Nazzadi woman is speaking her native language, but Jamie's PCPU translates. "The deal is sealed. His bloodstream is starting to show antibodies to the fairy dust, though. I'll bring a sample back with me."

The voice from Lisbon is deep, and also speaks Nazzadi - natively, if Jamie's ears judge correctly. "The Americans have dug up more dross. They are digging nowhere important. Just a ruined castle."

"It could be important." The woman frowns. "The report said their archaeologist used the Powder of Ibn Gazi. You don't waste that."

The voice from Lisbon stays silent for a few seconds. "Alright then. Your report has been excellent. It seems they will be flying to China yet. Arrange to be in the area, just in case."

"But--" A look of real fear spreads across the Nazzadi woman's face. The Lisbon voice cuts her off harshly. "He's in far more danger than you are, my dear," comes his rebuke. The call ends.

Jamie checks the recording on her phone. She sends it off with a short note to the same address she's been receivign instructions from. She's hang out a bit after to see what other instructions come online.

"Get out of Rome," is the only reply.
