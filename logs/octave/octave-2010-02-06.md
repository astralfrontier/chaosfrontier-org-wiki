# FUTILE OCTAVE 2010-02-06

Nathan is in the midst of his his off-duty time; the senior scientist overrides this with his intraship comm call. "Drs. Bowen, Ling, Short, and Mr. Latham will join me in the conference room, please." The technician feels a slight shudder running through the hull of the _Jeremiah Moore_ as it cruises over the Carpathians, almost a day after the initial discovery. A shuttle has detached itself.

"What the hell is this about?" Nathan thinks to himself. He can't recall any discussion of an additional shuttle sortie, and after the events of the past few days, unscheduled ops make him twitchy. On impulse, he pulls out his pill bottle to check its contents - yup, still plenty - before responding to the summons.

The archaeological staff are gathered together. Most of them shoot Nathan a series of unreadable looks, but Armitage's face is red and his veins bulge on his brow. Next to him is his PCPU, displaying his incoming email. Nathan can see two messages. The most recent reads "ATTN: Armitage...". The scientist quickly focuses on only one message, fumbling at the keypad of his mini-computer as he does so. Guilt?

The remaining message, then, is an order from the Starkweather corporate office: deliver the armor and the cup that were recovered to the company's Rome office for immediate sale. Jamie Solak is to escort the goods, alone. The buyer is even named: Selene Greyman Import/Export.

"But we only just got them yesterday!" exclaims Nathan. He spends a moment in thought - Jamie Solak, he's heard that name before - and then he remembers the woman who'd killed the refugee back in Kiev.

"Quite so," grumbles Armitage. "All this leaves us is the inscriptions, and all we know about _them_ is that they were concealed by subtle art. Fortunately we have images of everything. That's.. something."

Nathan rubs his forehead. "This makes my head hurt," he says. "Why'd I sign up for this gig, anyway?" He pats the vial he keeps close to his chest - he knows damn well why. "I guess we ought to study the hell out of what we do have, at least."

"Right. And there's something else." The senior man turns his PCPU around and thumbs through the display - almost cautious against someone else reading any of it. He pulls up another message and displays it.

The message is in fact a series of transmissions aggregated together by subject. It's mostly a communication between Adrian Kelvin, your man in Paris, and two representatives of the N.E.G. - Corporal Willis and Assistant Director Keeshon.

Willis fired the first salvo, a warning shot across the bow. "Mr. Kelvin, _Moore_'s probable entry into Kiev airspace is highly irregular. We are formally notifying you that your company is facing censure and possible criminal proceedings. The information about a rescue expedition that you sent looks, quite frankly, specious and cooked-up. I don't like playing games."

Kelvin's response had come within minutes. "As it turns out, our team has made a sigificant discovery and we were interested in speaking with the Ashcroft Foundation about turning over some of this material. Unfortunately our ground team did not survive whatever happened in Kiev itself." This is the point where Keeshon came into the thread: "Mr. Kelvin, on behalf of the Foundation I extend my sincere appreciation for your level tone. Allow me to express the condolences of the Foundation on the loss of your people..." The messages continue somewhat in this vein, but Nathan and the others get the idea: Starkweather is buying itself out of a fine with archaeological knowledge.

Armitage lets out a sigh. "Alright. This is how it stands. We have to turn over whatever we got. We still get copies, bless the stars for digital. Solak's already in flight. Any questions? I need to go talk to DeGroot."

"Just one," says Nathan. "More of a speculation really. If the Company's in such deep shit with the NEG, why'd we go sell off the physical artifacts to a private buyer? Did the agent even know the NEG was looking at us, or did these Selene Greyman folks effectively outbid the NEG itself?"

Ling nods in agreement. Armitage smirks a bit, then leans forward. "We can't surrender what we don't have, young man."

"Ah, I get it," says Nathan. "We're gonna lose 'em anyway, so why not make a buck on it." He's got a sense that Armitage was actually taken off guard by the whole thing, but 'why not make a buck' makes a good post-hoc rationalization, at least.

Nobody else has much to say. Armitage, sensing the directionless tone of the group, claps his hands. "Fine! We have data, now get to work on it!" The others smile appreciatively, moving back to their respective cabins. And Armitage himself stalks off to find DeGroot.

DeGroot isn't far away. In fact, he's right next door, in the galley, loitering over a brewing pot of coffee. He's heard most of the conversation, and nods respectfully as Armitage enters.

The senior scientist harrumphs. "Not a bit of privacy on this vessel, is there," he asks testily. "Well then I shan't repeat the whole business. Let me just say that we have our new destination, and we'll be departing once Solak is back aboard." He pauses a moment. "It's in China."

DeGroot frowns. "It's odd that they chose Solak to make the delivery. Are you sure you want to leave that business all to her?"

Nathan had been wandering to his quarters, but pauses as he overhears this, and returns to the galley for a cup of coffee of his own. He's gotten curious about this, and wants to listen - and doesn't want to have to pretend otherwise.

"There's, hm, extenuating circumstances," Armitage replies lamely. "One of our other guys makes the call on this."

"Well, _someone_ made the call to sell off those artifacts in a big hurry," Nathan notes. "If there's more than Jamie than meets the eye, it makes sense to have her go deliver precious cargo to people who merit closer inspection. I just hope she's on our side." He pauses. "Whatever that means."

DeGroot ponders for a moment, then shrugs. "Not my business, then. Very well. On to China. Umm... the direct route goes through occupied territory. If we go around, it will take longer, but it will be safer, and we won't piss off the NEG further." DeGroot leaves out specifics about the dangers: there's worse things than Kiev to be seen in central Asia.

"Plot any course you like," Armitage replies. "These sites aren't going anywhere. It's conditions on the ground that we.. that we worry about more." He turns, heading back to his cabin.

"Well, _I'm_ still curious about this Rome business," Nathan remarks to DeGroot. "Sounds like we've got plenty of time till we get to our next destination. Time enough to do at least a little discreet snooping around through the data networks."

"You any good at that?" DeGroot asks.

"Depends," replies Nathan. "I'm not exactly gonna be able to hack into secure corporate nets, but I can at least check into the public records of these Selene Greyman people. See if I can find any signs of... well. Mostly of things _not_ being there that I'd expect to be."

---

Selene Greyman Import/Export began life after the complete economic devastation of the First Arcanotech War. It rose out of the scavenged, sold or defaulted assets of a dozen other companies, thrown together by a group of venture capitalists who'd managed to hang onto gold and other hard assets and stashed them away in various secure locations throughout France, Germany and the continent.

The company has made a number of trips into orbit and beyond, and has a few space assets on file. Whether or not these things still stand is an open question. Its safety record is impeccable, ranked in the top ten safest companies for cross-Atlantic and cross-Pacific flights.

The company has its fair share of citations for misconduct from the NEG, but no notable arrests have ever been made. They keep their nose clean.

The executives and heavy hitters in the company are primarily human, with a few Nazzadi in the lower ranks. Most look to be Arabic or Indian; many are Sikh, by the turbans they traditionally wear. Broad smiles and happy faces predominate the PR photos, as usual.

Nathan presents his findings to DeGroot the next time the pilot is off duty. "So no solid information yet, as expected. If they're this safe on transoceanic flights, though, they've definitely got something going for them defensively. Based solely on the public record, I'd have to say that they're... well, that they're about as trustworthy as Starkweather is."

"So, the next question is, how did the sale come about in the first place," Nathan continues. "Apparently the approval came from the Japanese office. And this whole thing came about within a day of us getting the goods, remember. Which means that someone in the chain of command up from Armitage must've passed it along. Someone was probably interested in our expedition specifically. And why not - archaeology is serious business these days. There's probably a person or two in the company who're personally interested in _every_ expedition."

DeGroot nods. "So they look legit. But who doesn't?" He points into a navigation hologram. "This is our route - through the Middle East, down India, into Australia, across the Philipines, and then Taipei. Over land, most of the way, and we've got good reason to stop in Taipei for a day or two before moving on." The pilot flicks his wrist and the map zooms across the Sea of Japan. "So if you have 'business' at the Japanese office, I think we can accomodate you."

"Fair enough," says Nathan. "I'm gonna look up Hu-san in the HR database. If nothing else, I want to know the names around him - who he reports to, who reports to him, and so on - so I'll recognize them if they come up in another context. Also, I could drop the man himself an email, just to see what he has to say for himself."

A few minutes suffice. Nathan stares at the data on his screen. The man has a plain-looking profile picture, a note saying that he is on vacation and currently unable to reply to email for the next two weeks, and a forward to his secretary - Tietta Martin, also in Japan. His full name is given in kanji; when westernized with family name last, it's Yuuno Hu.

He reports to the VP of EMEA - the European_Middle East_Asian market, who then reports directly to the CEO.

"Oh come _on_," Nathan mutters to himself as he reads. It isn't just the name, although that's the icing on the cake - who approves a major sale of valuable archaeological relics and then slinks off for a vacation? This one, Nathan decides, should be brought to DeGroot immediately.

DeGroot scowls. 'You-know-who'? How stupid do they think we are? The artifacts are none of my business, but I'm feeling insulted by association... you gonna tell Armitage?"

"I think I wasn't supposed to have read the mail in the first place," Nathan comments. "But yeah, I guess I should get over that. I have to think Armitage'll think this is a much bigger deal than me looking over his shoulder."

At the door of Armitage's cabin, Nathan knocks politely. "Dr. Armitage? Just wanted to talk to you about Yuuno Hu. Got a minute?"

There's a heavy sigh. The door opens. Armitage is behind it. "Fine. Get in here, you idiots," he mutters.

Nathan slips inside. "So yeah, sorry about reading over your shoulder. But this seemed important. The HR DB says he's only two steps removed from the CEO, so if this isn't an obvious alias, I figure he wouldn't exactly be a total unknown in the Company."

DeGroot follows, closing the door behind him. With three people, the cabin is suddenly feels conspiratorialy cramped. "More likely, the name 'Hu' is just there as a front when nobody else wants to take the blame. An inside joke known to employees." DeGroot looks at Armitage. "I don't need to know what happened, and you don't need to tell me... unless it affects our survival."

Armitage snaps on a small electronic device that hums a reassuring tone after a few seconds. The door closes behind both men. "Obviously it's an alias," he says wearily. "Now what do I have to say or do to get you boys to relax and do your jobs?"

"Honestly, Doctor," DeGroot says, "for my part, there's only one issue. Solak. I know her type, and someone put her here for a reason. If you know anything... well... we need to make sure she's pointed in the right direction when she goes off."

Armitage peers carefully at DeGroot. "'Her type', you say?"

"We saw a refugee, in Kiev," DeGroot says slowly. "He - she - hell, I don't even know - was going to break cover and bring the Migou down on our heads. I put one shot through her thigh to keep her still. Solak put three through her chest and upper spine." More softly, "It's bugging the hell out of me. But Solak... didn't even break a sweat."

"In other words she did the unfortunate but necessary thing?" Armitage peers at DeGroot some more.

DeGroot frowns. "The unfortunate thing should never be done lightly, Doctor."

"And because .. this girl did not show, hm, adequate emotion to satisfy you? Adequate hesitation? You suspect her of being.. uh, something or other?" Armitage clasps his hands in front of him. "Suppose I know something, and tell you that I know, and refuse to divulge details. What will you do, Mr. DeGroot?"

Nathan speaks up. "Dunno about Degroot, but for my part, it's like I said earlier. I don't mind someone with nerves of steel covering my ass, but I do want to feel reassured that she's on my side, is all. Same thing with Hu-san. Someone's up to something weird, but that's hardly unusual these days. As long as _someone_ knows what they're doing, I can live with it." He looks straight at Dr. Armitage. "I'll admit right now - I really _don't_ want to know the full truth, unless I have to."

DeGroot scowls. "I'll fly the ship," he says evenly. "And I try to bring us home alive. If you want me to do that with incomplete information, that's up to you." He moves for the door. "The new course is ready. We can leave as soon as Solak gets back." The door clicks shut behind him.

"Idiot," mutters Armitage. He sighs. "Well, Mr. Latham, since you are apparently a co-conspirator in this matter, please go inform your hot-headed pilot friend that I do _not_, in fact, hold some secret about Ms. Solak."

"Fair enough," says Nathan, getting up. "_Someone_ does, of course. But if that doesn't worry _you_ - for whatever reason - then I won't worry about it either. I don't need something new to make me lose sleep - I've got enough trouble with that as it is."

The scientist shrugs. "Everyone aboard was vetted. That's good enough for me. That ought to be good enough for a man we pulled out of jail. Good-bye, sir."
