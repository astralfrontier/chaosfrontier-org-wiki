# FUTILE OCTAVE 2010-02-20

An image of a book appears on the holographic screens of the _Moore_'s control stations. Dr. Armitage begins to speak. "What you see here is the Liber Razielis Archangeli, also called the Sefer Raziel HaMalakh or the Book of Raziel the Angel. Written sometime around the 12th century, and compiled by Eleazer of Worms in its most recent form. It was suppressed as a work of black magic at the time."

"The inscriptions that we found in the burial site in the Carpathians invoke some of the same astrological principles mentioned in the Sefer Raziel. In particular, there is a heavy emphasis on the Hellenistic zodiac - the twelve signs which I'm sure most of you have heard of. The original program we were to follow involved ten dig sites. There were originally twelve, but two of those were in N.E.G. territory and are already underway by the Ashcroft Foundation. These sites have some correspondences to the zodiac signs, suggesting some form of planning or agreement over a large area."

"In other words, whoever Ilya Muromets really was, he was probably working in connection with others, and they knew something of what they were doing. They sealed something away at the Carpathian site. Later legend ascribed somewhat more mundane heroics to whatever had been done there."

"We've done quite a bit of translation on the inscriptions and cross-referenced it with the Sefer Raziel. Although the inscriptions don't mention the Aleph Midrashim by that name, they're quite clearly talking about the same thing - luckily we had some kabbalistic scholars back home working on this, and they noticed the connection early."

Armitage clears his throat. A text transcription appears on the holography, and he reads aloud from it. "'That which filtered down from the heavens has been embedded in the earth for all time. All and forever.'" He stops a moment. "This is complicated business, as simple as it sounds. The specific words that were chosen, along with their spacing, are ritualistic, like poetry with a mathematical element. The syllables and characters themselves each have a numerological meaning. Essentially the scribe is intent on giving his pronouncement mystic weight."

The reading continues. "'Turn the seasons quickly and do not dally, for time does not walk but stagger. Enter the right house and you will be a welcome guest, but enter the wrong one and it will be your doom.'" The archaeologist pauses again to explain. "This is akin to the notion of the sephirot - connected nodes on a graph through which there is a proper path. What this suggests to us is that the sites themselves are related, and that you are supposed to visit them in a specific order."

"The complication here is that the Ashcroft Foundation has already begun their digs. We're working through the rest of the inscriptions to ensure that things are done in the proper order, and we've sent guarded hints to a few of our high-level contacts in the Foundation. If we just came out and admitted what we're doing, of course, we'd be arrested. We weighed that against the unknown but not inconsiderable risk of disturbing these sites in the wrong order, along with the rewards of actually continuing with our program of excavation. You see, the Liber Razielis Archangeli and certain other works have true significance. Their knowledge is being unlocked by the clues given on these inscriptions."

Dr. Ling raises her hand and is recognized. "Dr. Armitage, I am understanding that our destination is.. is China. Is this correct?"

Armitage nods solemnly. "The Tarim Basin, specifically." A diagram appears on the holographs. "North of the Tibetan plateau, and one of the old sites of the Silk Road. Much commerce took place between East and West in this desolation." He sighs quietly. "To answer the unspoken question many of you are thinking, yes. The Rapine Storm has been here. They do not seem to be active _now_ but our timing is determined by the order of entry into the sites. This site is next."

McTavish speaks up next. "Sir, what be the orders of engagement if we should happen upon remnants of the Cult?"

Armitage looks troubled. "In the ideal case that won't come up at all." A few minor rumbles of dissent come from the pilots' contingent and Armitage raises his hands in recognitioin. "Alright. Assuming our luck doesn't hold out, you will follow the instructions of the senior pilot on site. If he is unavailable you will defer to the copilot. If they are both .. unavailable, you should return to your shuttle and to the Moore with best possible speed."

The archaeologist continues. "The law we're breaking in this case is intrusion into forbidden territory. Nobody's going to levy charges of murder on you should you defend yourselves against the Cult. Just.. be careful, and stay safe. Don't separate yourselves, stay as a group." Dr. Ling can be seen nodding in fervent agreement, though she says nothing.

Jamie's shuttle docks in due course with her parent ship, and Jamie disembarks. In due course, notification is transmitted to the flight deck.

Jamie's hands breeze across the control surfaces of the craft, finishing it's final docking. She breathes deeply. . o O ( This is going to be fun ) she thinks to herself, and dhe stands, and begins to exit the shuttle.

DeGroot notes the shuttle's return, and loads the _Moore_'s new course. Through the Middle East, then India, then across the ocean to Australia, north through Indonesia and the Phillipines, China, then... whatever Armitage is hunting. NEG air superiority is good everywhere except over the ocean. He taps out a text message to Armitage, not wanting to speak to the scientist yet. _Solak is back. Ready to go._

The answer is succinct. _Proceed_.

Jamie steps out of the shuttle, and looks around. Not teh welcome she was expecting. She quietly tries to make her way to her bunk without incident. She hangs her new dress in her bunk, and keeps to herself as much as she can.

The _Moore_ rises between the jagged tips of the Carpathian mountains. The cockpit fills with comm traffic from the NEG's Bucharest air defense zone. Fortunately, the _Moore_ is recognized as a friendly, and whatever skulduggery Starkweather is up to, it seems to have smoothed over any offenses for the intrusion into Kiev. The big ship angles south and quickly reaches a speed just below that of sound. Monitors on the ship wink on, displaying the route and the ETA: just under 18 hours.

The ship turns east and crosses the Bosporus Strait into Turkey. Night comes faster when flying east at almost 600 miles an hour, and the ground below turns into a dark, glassy plain, broken here and there by city lights, highways... and sometimes, fires. Things burning in the darkness. The lights disappear as the ship crosses into Iran. Rice and Ebony take the flight deck. Degroot retreats to his cabin and locks the door, napping until the crossing of the Indian ocean.

The signs of human civilization shine more brightly as the ship reaches the Arabian Sea; the coastlines of Iran and Pakistan are lit dimly but regularly by everything from fishing villages to NEG outposts. The brightest lights are from arcology domes under construction - welders working into the night to build new placesfor humanity to hide from the stars. Soon the _Moore_ reaches Mumbai, a sprawling collection of domes that completely covers the banks of the Ulhas River. The cockpit comes to life again with interrogations and replies by automatic air defense systems; still the ship is allowed to pass.

During the flight, a fight almost breaks out between McTavish, Rice, Naza and Kova. The topic in question seems to be a bootlegged digital download of the movie 'Sangria' which one of the four - none of whom admit exactly who it was - transferred to the _Moore_'s computer from outside. A few racial epithets are traded back and forth, but everyone settles down before it gets too far. Dr. Short is instrumental in restoring order.

The argument awakens DeGroot, who resumes control of the ship; Sri Lanka is just a few minutes away anyway, and here, if anywhere, the trip will get dicey...

The NEG has still coded Malaysia as an 'Amber Zone', which is a polite way of saying that the Rapine Storm turned it into a vision of Hell and has since moved on. The NEG has established a convoy route from Sri Lanka to Port Hedland, Australia, and patrols it heavily with air and watercraft. But the carnage of Kiev has made DeGroot less inclined to trust official guarantees of safety, and he keeps a sharp watch on the radar for every mile of the trip.

Warning indicators begin flashing on the pilot's board - not an attack, thankfully, just engine trouble. The _Moore_ has enough levitative capacity to stay in the air, but repairs are called for.

"Oh, Hell," DeGroot mutters, and summons Nathan to the flight deck. "I'm not going to tell you to get everyone ready to bail," DeGroot tells him. "But we're over water and far from shore. If you've got anyone who can help us with the engines, please wake them up now."

Nathan is never easy to wake, but catches up on current events quickly enough to grab a toolbox and head belowdecks, into the guts of the _Moore_. Working on A-Pods that are currently in service is never a fun time; fortunately, there's enough redundant horsepower aboard the _Moore_ to sustain shutting down the offending A-Pod entirely.

Fortunately, the problem proves to be relatively routine. Some of the power couplings with the D-Engines are out of spec, and the insulation has melted on some of the cables. A half hour and some spare conduits later, service is restored - although Nathan insists on five minutes more to test the repairs under load before he's prepared to call it good.

DeGroot forces himself to relax. _The freaking D-Engines can feel when you're on edge. I shouldn't be; I've had worse jobs than this._ He tries to keep the ship on an even keel until landfall.

The ship reaches Port Hedland and turns northeast. This used to be one of the most underpopulated areas of the world, but the light of the coming dawn illuminates dozens of NEG refugee camps all over the coast. Refugees from Malaysia are trying to piece together a life from the wreckage left by the Rapine Storm. The _Moore_ soon leaves the sad scene behind. As the ship flies over Indonesia and the Phillipines, the light of day shows the deep blue waters and brilliant green islands, marred in places by grey domes, slablike city blocks, and the brown mires of polluted rivers. It was evening when the _Moore_ left Romania, and it is approaching evening again as it docks in Taipei.

The layover is short - Latham's repairs are solid, if improvised. Spares are replaced and tanks topped off. DeGroot naps again, as the _Moore_ heads inland into mainland China. One of the oldest continuing civilizations, is still the most mysterious. The site that Armitage has requested is uncomfortably close to both Migou-occupied space and territory raveged by the Rapine Storm. DeGroot resumes the bridge at 10pm, as the ship approaches the blinking green dot on the map. The last NEG air patrol is an hour behind them. Nobody has tried to arrest them... yet... but nobody is coming to help either.

---

Kashgar was an oasis, then a city. Now it is an ossuary. The bones of the dead lie strewn carelessly across the ruined brickwork of the Muslim city that once stood proudly here. Nobody wants too close a look. But surmounting the pointed spire of every mosque, the Rapine Storm has taken great pride in positioning a corpse to kneel in the direction of Mecca, impaled delicately on the needlepoint.

"'Within sight of the oasis lies he who shall...'" Armitage reads from his notes. "We are manning all four shuttles," he announces. "Pilots will stream live video back to the _Moore_. Cameras will look in all directions. We are looking for a particular feature of geography. When the computers find it, we will have our dig site. Gentlemen, make it so."

DeGroot arranges a duty roster - four shuttles, four pilotschangeline. The heavier weapons are taken from concealment, a pair of gauss rifles for each shuttle. Of the three remaining pilots, one stays with the Moore, and two don the heavy Asmodian-83 battlesuits.

DeGroot assigns himself to one of the shuttles, and hesitates before assigning Solak to the same shuttle. "Hell. Better to keep an eye on her."

Before launch, Armitage draws DeGroot aside and rests a hand lightly on his shoulder, leaning forward to whisper: "Thanks for giving her a chance, Mr. DeGroot. Listen, out here, there's nobody else we can count on but each other. We need to trust one another, and I wanted to tell you that I appreciate it."

DeGroot hides his surprise well. "I thought it over, Doctor. Everyone deserves a fair shake."

Jamie, for her part, is slightly oblivious to DeGroot, only keeping somewhat of an eye on Armitage. She checks out one of the Gauss rifles assigned to the shuttle. She takes a seat, the rifle locked in beside her.

The shuttles launch. Arcing in a graceful symmetrical spiral, they come about once sufficiently clear of the _Moore_ itself. The search pattern has been computed and fed in; all the pilot needs to do is watch for the color red to appear on his board. They sweep outward, forming a swastika with the _Moore_ at the center. Telemetry is relayed. The windswept desert is surveyed.

The first sign of warning is a loud proximity alarm. The shuttle is approximately five miles away from the _Moore_ and correspondingly far from its sister ships, so none of them could be on a collision. DeGroot sees the holograph flash to the front of his view, recognizes a simple surface-to-air missile. He has one chance.

It's followed a moment later by a second, and DeGroot and pinpoint the source of the first attack. Someone has been waiting under the dunes. The second shot comes from another direction.

The proximity alarm is done buzzing, which means that DeGroot is surprised indeed when an explosion rocks the shuttle. The A-Pod indicators flicker out and a surge briefly knocks the computers offline. Instrumentation starts to come back right about the time the shuttle strikes the sandy ground and begins to sink into it.

The safety systems engage halfheartedly. The cabin fills with a cushioning foam that absorbs most of the damage, though all three passengers feel the air knocked out of their lungs on impact.

"We're been shot!" DeGroot shouts into his mike. He works to get free of the crash webbing. "We're bailing!"

Jamie reaches down and starts in on her straps, pulling the straps free, at least partially.

DeGroot frees himself, but doesn't stand yet. He hunches over the control panel and spends a valuable moment trying to get the lifter back on, to stop the sinking.

The crash foam solvent begins to spray through the compartment, neutralizing and breaking down the material that cushioned the crew on impact. Outside, the sand is starting to creep up the side of the shuttle - it's moving at about 2 feet per second.

The response to DeGroot's instructions to the shuttle come back in the negative - the A-Pods aren't functioning. But from the direction of the explosion, they shouldn't be gone or destroyed.

Jamie opens a radio channel and begins speaking, "Mayday. We've been hit. I'm not sure by what. We are grounded."

DeGroot levers himself out of his seat. "We're not flying. Time to get out."

Nathan stands up and bangs on the side of the hatch, looking at the sand rising over the window. "Damn. Sealed in." He pauses for a moment. "The sifter!" He turns toward the cargo bay.

Something's missing - some noise. The quiet hum of the air circulator isn't running. Either it was damaged in the crash, or perhaps the computer shut it off since there's no longer air coming in from the vents to outside. But the shuttle is now on reserve air.

DeGroot grabs up one of the rifles. "Solak, follow the genius!"

There's another explosion, this time much more restrained. It rocks the shuttle for a moment. This time, however, DeGroot is paying attention and recognizes it. There was no missile hit. This was a grenade. And it came from inside.

It apparently came from aft - near the cargo section.

Hurrying back, the flight crew surveys the damage. The shuttle is entirely sunk and still descending through the sand. There is good news and bad news, however. The sifter itself is fine. What was destroyed were the cargo modules that held the group's supplies - including, most significantly, the air masks and tanks.

"Solak, I'm sorry I doubted you," DeGroot says flatly. "Obviously there's someone else who hates us more."

Nathan surveys the damage. "Lucky whoever it was that sabotaged us didn't finish thinking all the way through." He heads for the sifter, and pauses. "Unless... the timer hasn't gone off yet." He shakes his head, and resumes course. "Fuck it. If the sifter's bombed, we're dead anyway."

Jamie turns to look, being slightly late to teh party, having stopped to grab her own rifle. She shrugs, "Indeed." Is all she seems to offer for this. She looks, "It could be that the grenades set themselves off... It did blow up where they're normally kept."

"We'll look for any other surprises," DeGroot says. "You just dig us out."

While Nathan begins to compute, to somehow script into the sifter's LAI the absurdly out-of-band scenario the group has found itself in, Jamie and DeGroot look at the smoking ruins of the cargo modules. Guns, extra food, and the survival gear all neatly incinerated themselves, leaving twisted and smoking plastic which contained the brunt of the explosion.

"OK," says Nathan eventually. "It's tricky, but I think I can do it. Now..." he says, glaring at the cargo bay doors. "How do I get this thing in contact with the sand without smothering us?"

"While I'm thinking about _that_..." Nathan adds, turning to DeGroot as the pilot continues his inspection. "So how'd we come to crash, anyway? I heard the explosion..."

"The a-pods all lost power," DeGroot replies, and points to the charred cargo pallettes. "They pods themselves weren't hit. Any idea if that mess might have cut a cable or something?"

"I can check on that, at least," replies Nathan. "Or at least find out a reason I can't. With all our survival supplies gone, we could be up shit creek if we can't fly out of here."

DeGroot lays a hand on the sifter. "This thing is like an a-pod. If it can't dig out the shuttle, could it... um... tunnel itself?" It might just be DeGroot's imagination, but it feels stuffy, and it's definitely warmer.

Jamie slinks over to a computer terminal and taps some keys, trying to get the ship to tell us how much air we can expect to have.

The ship's computers flicker in and out twice before Jamie can get a reliable reading. But based on the volume of the shuttle and 3 adult passengers, the LAI spits out its best guess: 48 minutes.

"OK, hell with that," Nathan says, as the report comes in. "Let's dig out first, and then we can worry about the A-Pods. Gimme a hand with the cargo doors."

"This compartment will flood as soon as we open them," DeGroot points out. "We can lock ourselves in the cabin and open the cargo doors with the robot. But can you operate the sifter on remote?

"Yeah, that's a good idea," Nathan says. "Let's do it."

DeGroot readies the cargo arm. "The only other thing I can think of, is we strap ourselves to the outside of the Sifter and ride it to the surface, Doctor Strangelove style." One look from Nathan stops DeGroot from speculating further. "So we'll just get on with it, then."

"While I'm working on this," Nathan says, as his fingers fly across the terminal keyboard, "you two work on another way to get us out of this. It's gonna take me longer than I'd like to get this plan working, and we'll be cutting it close."

Jamie glances between Nathan and DeGroot as she thinks over something, fingers idly tapping at the terminal with the air estimate on it.

DeGroot moves over to the burned pallettes. "Alternatives. Well. I'm no good as a mechanic, but I can try to get the a-pod back online. If it slows our descent that will be better for you, right?"

Jamie looks between the two. "I'm..." She thinks, a hard choice, to be sure. She shakes her head, "At least, I think I can give us some more time..." She thinks this over. And looks, "I think I'm going to save your lives. Or at least, it will help. This will probably bring questions. Let's get out of this before that happens." She looks levely at the other two, waiting for some sort of ascent.

Something in Jamie's demeanor makes Nathan pause in his work. "What are you talking about?" he says, furrowing his brow.

DeGroot stops what he's doing, and looks up from a tangle of half-burned power cables. "I can keep anyone's secrets. Even yours."

Jamie furrows, "It's... complicated?" She walks meteredly to the forward part of the cabin, "I'm going to hide myself from your site. I ask that for your own sake you don't come look, but I probably cannot stop you. This should give us much more time for everyone to finish... whatever's going to happen here. At very least make you you hook everything up before you peek." She looks levelly at the two, trying to impart seriousness as she squirrels herself up next to a seat, as hidden from view as she can be... before she changes.

DeGroot gives Latham a hard look. "I know you're a scientist, but don't think about it. Don't try to understand what she said. Just understand the sifter." He tosses down the mess of power cables. "No hope for these. I'm going to try to bleed us some air out of the pneumatics. If there are any."

Nathan nods. "I'll say what I said before: if I don't need to know about it, I'm not going to ask." He returns to his work on the sifter programming.

It is said that the change takes each person seperately, as she shifts from her natural form into the natural form of something... altogether unnatural. Her limbs twist in impossible spirals, forearms and claves twisting theselves somehow into darkness. Her height seems to grow, even as she takes up no more room. Were any to lay eyes on her, the sight seems to want to slip off her dark, shadowing pale that takes it's toll on her snin. Her legs, curled up twist, her fingers shaping into horrible claws. Her head elongates and blackens, as one might see sticking out of the ground from a burned out forest. She has a face, if it can be called that, but the darkened midnight of her stare is not one to meet casually. Her form trails black smoke off of the.. thing, as the change takes form, some of which can probably be seen by the pilot and the engineer.

Nathan spends a moment thinking of the sounds that just came from behind him. They were soft, indistinct... and yet they make the hair stand up on the back of his neck. _Jamie warned us not to peek..._ he remembers. He had started to wonder why not... and now suddenly he seriously, desperately _does not want to know_. He buries his face in the terminal, careful not to look too closely at the monitor for fear that it might reflect something behind him.

DeGroot does his best not to look towards the cockpit. It's a little easier than he thought; he's seen a lot of horrible things, and he hopes to see many more before he's done. But the suspicion of Solak has been gnawing at him... now that he stops to think about it, it was just two days ago, that she shot that poor bastard in Kiev. And he can't help but see, out of the corner of his excellent pilot's eyes, something moving in the front of the ship. Something inky and dark that has nothing to do with the poor lighting or the sand sliding over the hull. DeGroot grinds his teeth, knowing that in a few minutes he's going to have to go in there and fact it. Or he can stay here and die. It's the kind of choice that he hates, more than all the times he's been shot at.

On the monitor, the 'air remaining' countdown timer sits at 45 minutes. The seconds click down. At 45:00, the timer flashes. And it reads 1:06:59.
