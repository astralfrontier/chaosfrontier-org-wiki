# FUTILE OCTAVE 2010-03-20

The shuttle's descent into the sands of the Chinese desert has slowed enough for the sifter to be put to use.

Latham is hunched over the Sifter terminal, trying to hack a way out; There's not much for DeGroot to do. Solak is in the cockpit... DeGroot shudders. He's not going to wait there. This moment in time has no use for him; he can only cast his attention forward, to what might happen if they reach the surface, or back, to how the shuttle was sabotaged. The pilot digs his way into the charred remains of the cargo lockers again. "He did it with our own grenades, for sure... and probably by remote control... so..." All he can hope for is that the mole made some mistake; it's hard to get evidence out of the ruined mess.

Jamie listens to the men in her Tager form. She wraps the darkness that seems to flow around herself like a warm pillow or comfortable sweater. Much like Winter's icy grip pulling around Summer's halcyon days, Jamie's Tager form was missed, for it's icy grip on the younger girl's form. She smiles, trying to force herself not to interfere with the two men in back. Her darkened fingers stroke along the length of the rifle in her hap carefully, the Tager relishing the delicious implement of death so close...

Meanwhile, Nathan's fingers dance over the sifter terminal. He doesn't know much about the geology of the area, but if they've stopped sinking, he knows most of what he needs to know - namely, that there's a bunch of sand above them that has to get out of the way, and not much place to put it except sideways. And he knows one other thing, which he tries his hardest to keep from thinking about too hard: whatever Jamie did, she isn't breathing anymore. He hopes he doesn't have to find out why... or at least, that he can postpone the knowledge until he has time to deal with it.

DeGroot didn't manage to find much, but after about twenty minutes of searching, along with cross-references to the shuttle's wounded computer and his own PCPU, he establishes something else. The first grenade was wedged next to one of the bulkheads. Its explosion severed the power conduits and control lines to the A-Pods. When it went off, the first thing the shuttle would do was fall like a rock. But it's also unlikely that the saboteur simply got so lucky in his or her placement of the trap.

Not only was the grenade well-placed, but some of the lines were actually rerouted to make the sabotage possible.

"This took time," DeGroot mutters. "Time and skill. He didn't throw this together an hour ago." Suddenly he's pissed off; a little casual sabotage he can understand... but premeditation makes it so much more personal.

In the cockpit, Nathan's urge to look over his shoulder has been steadily increasing - his imagination populating the almost complete silence behind him. But as with the catacombs under Kiev, Nathan pushes his fear from his mind long enough to enter the last few lines of code - and he makes some mental notes for improvements to the sifter scripting language. "There. This... should work," he says, wiping the cold sweat form his brow. "All we need to do... is push the button." He calls out. "DeGroot! We're ready!"

DeGroot wastes no time. He retreats to the cockpit, pointedly not looking at Solak's hiding place. The cabin had seemed pretty roomy before, with only the three of them, but now... he sighs. "OK. Do it, Latham."

Latham operates the robot arm via the computer. Already damaged by the attack, the shuttle's system is not going to be good for much longer - but it should last long enough to bring in some air, and hopefully to lift off.

There's a grinding noise as the arm forces the door outward against the press of sand, making room for the sifter's gravitational beam. Abruptly the shuttle lists to one side. The occupants are secure enough - this was expected - but it slightly complicates the program Nathan had to write. Fortunately, this too was expected.

On the other side of the barrier keeping the three occupants from the desert sand, they hear the hum of the sifter as it's slowly entombed. But it fights back. Its D-Engine hums; the pressors exert themselves, playing across the sand. The display is banal enough on the PCPU's screen. Tons of material moved, clearance in front of the sifter, and so forth.

Minutes pass. The timer showing available air ticks inexorably downward.

Gradually Latham's PCPU display shows something promising. The sifter is angling its beam upward, to the limit of its reach - any more and it would start pressing against the ceiling and probably tear off the top of the shuttle. But this means that the sand has been pushed away. The sifter's carving a tunnel upwards. To the surface.

Twelve minutes of air remain. The sifter's managed part of an impression in the sand, enough that air could start to filter down if the sifter's own pressor beam weren't constantly pushing outward to fend off the sand.

At this point, Latham and DeGroot have a brief, whispered conference. If the sifter is allowed to traverse upward - in other words, tear off the shuttle's roof with its pressor effect - then the hole can be dug faster. It completely compromises life support and ruins the shuttle in the long term, but none of that matters. The question is: _will it get them back to the Moore_? And failing that, in the air long enough to get help?

The A-Pod connections have been severed by the grenade. Those have to be rerouted anyway. The most reliable source of D-Engine and pod parts at this point is the sifter itself. It'll probably have to be cannibalized. But the shuttle can fly without its roof, if it holds up to the strain of losing it.

"Do it," DeGroot says. "I'll take my chances flying anything, compared to... everything else."

All that Nathan need do is disable the overrides he set up. It's a simple matter.

The hellish tearing and grinding, on the other hand, is not so easy. The shuttle rocks itself as the sifter inexorably tears off a chunk of it. The devil's own knife can be heard making a rent in the metal, and even some of the structural members in the cockpit start to give way. But after tense seconds, the noise abates. On the computer, the sifter's sensors conclude that there's no further obstruction. It pours on the power.

Eight minutes pass. The noise winds down. The sifter has completed its assigned task and gone into standby.

"Sensors say we're done. I think," Nathan says, his voice quavering. "And we aren't going to last much longer. Let's get it over with."

"Seconded," DeGroot says. He reaches for the latch, and slowly draws it back.

Jamie still tries to stay curled up in her corner, but she, too, is feeling slightly light headed, though probably not as bad as the other men.

A bit of sand pours in. But not much - just a small pile that had accumulated against the door. Beyond, the sudden light is brighter than expected. The air is fresh, but dry and hot and papery. The shuttle's roof has been torn up, but the rest of it looks intact.

The shuttle now rests in a deep depression, whose slopes are just shallow enough that sand doesn't begin to tumble back into it. It's a few stories deep, and climbing will be a challenge if it comes to that. But with luck, the A-Pods can be reactivated. If so, the shuttle can force itself out of the loose grip of the remaining desert sand.

DeGroot breathes deeply, and considers the enormity of the new problem. "Latham. Can you get the shuttle back in the air? And how long will it take?"

"Don't know yet. I need to have a closer look at the damage first. I didn't have time before," Nathan adds with a strained grin. "It'll be easier if I can cannibalize the sifter. Man, this sortie's getting more expensive by the minute."

DeGroot considers this. "We owe you our lives. We need to ask more of you. We have to assume our allies have departed and our enemies are still here. So we need to run, and fast. Gut the sifter. Get us airborne, for however long."

Jamie feels the oxygen rush over her form, and sighs deeply. It seems to be over. She closes her eyes, and begins to change back. THe light-bending darkness that was surrounding her inky black form pulls into her extremeties, her arms and legs shortening, her presence becoming more in line with normality. She curls herself up into a ball on the chair for a second, having lost contact with her Tager self, she whimpers audibly, then stances, and starts to stand, making to enter the rear of the shuttle again.

Clambering out into the cabin, Nathan winces at the ragged-eged roof, then gets to work. Patting the sifter's hull gently in thanks, he pulls off the back cover, carefully shifts the D-Engine into standby, and unhooks the power couplings. All the tension and fear of the past hour is suddenly gone now that he has something to throw himself into. And to his pleasant surprise, despite the damage from the sabotage, most of the conduits themselves are more than intact enough to take the fresh power couplings.

When he's all done, Nathan alights on the cargo deck, dusting his hands off and grinning. "Good as new," he says. "Well, at least as far as the drive goes. I wouldn't redline it, or you'll finish the job the sifter started," he says, nodding to the roof. "But the actual lifters _themselves_ will do whatever you ask of them."

"Lovely," DeGroot breathes. "Alright. Everyone button up and strap in. We're running." The pilot settles into the command chair again and forces himself to relax. _The d-engine can feel when you're nervous..._

Jamie, unassumingy, not even sure where to start trying to talk to them, avoids the issue by pulling up one of the shuttle's compure displays, "Seems like they can't hear us." SHe says, to anyone that'll listen, "Probably the only way to get found is going to be to be seen."

"Then keep it quiet," DeGroot replies. "The enemy has radios too, I'm sure."

Nathan watches the relaxation routine, and grins. **Oh, don't worry, DeGroot,** he thinks to himself. **If you _aren't_ nervous, the D-Engine will fuck with you till you are.**

The failing computers deceive DeGroot at least once: they point him northwest, when he wants northeast. The sensors are active, but the software to interpret them is now fully offline. It takes visual sighting, then, to make out the silhouette of the _Jeremiah Moore_, stationkeeping on its powerful A-Pods, within a mile of where it ought to be.

Docking in the usual hangar is out of the question: the software that normally automates this task is offline. But the _Moore_ is broad enough that DeGroot could set the shuttle down on top of it.

"Take it easy," Nathan says, still twitchy. "If we aren't getting a response on the radio, the problem's on our end. We need to not make them too nervous about not responding to their hails."

"Really?" DeGroot says skeptically. "I don't like it. She's just sitting there. No other shuttles up. No comm chatter. There's only two things they should be doing: looking for us, or bugging out. I wonder if the saboteur fucked the shuttle comms? Somebody try their suit radio." DeGroot looks for a place to set down - near the _Moore_, but not on it. "The last thing we need is for them to think we're the Rapine Storm."

Jamie chimes in, "Yeah. I'm with DeGroot on this one. How close do you really think they would let us get if they thought we were some sort of threat." She taps a few keys on the control panel, "At least it's still in the air. Maybe whoever tried to do us in had a mutiny..."

"A shuttle with its roof blown out is hardly a threat," Nathan says. "Unless it tries to suicide. And if the _Moore's_ been taken over, we're dead, plain and simple." He turns on his suit radio. "Amazon to Moore. This is Nathan Latham from what's left of the Amazon calling the Jeremiah Moore, over."

DeGroot comes to a decision. "Screw it. Mutiny or not, inside that thing is still the safest place for two hundred miles." Using only his eyes and a muttered prayer, he aims the shuttle for a flat piece of the _Moore_'s back deck, as close to a loading hatch as possible. "When we hit, get out, and get below. Solak, keep that rifle close."

Jamie nods, "I'll do you one better." She says, and gets up out of her steat, and takes a position at the rear of the shuttle crouching near one of the walls, and holding her rifle in a position ready to fire, aiming out the back of the shuttle.

"If we go in on a war footing, they _will_ think we're attacking," Nathan says. "Someone needs to go out there with their hands up. I volunteer."

"Uh-uh," DeGroot responds, mildly. "We all go together. Besides...you've proven that you're the least expendable."

Jamie shrugs, "I'm willing to risk tense moments of misunderstanding for a ready battlefield position. Sir."

DeGroot says, "Then, Miss Solak, you aren't half as crazy as I thought."

The dorsal hatch slides open, admitting the three - carefully. Inside, the lights are on. Someone is yelling something. Solak descends, then covers the corridors carefully with a gauss rifle while DeGroot and Latham follow. All three arm themselves as best they can.

The shouting gets louder. From the bridge area, the three see the same sight at the same time: Dr. Ling, with a gauss rifle cradled unsteadily in her arms. She shrieks. Her face is red with exertion, and her eyes bulge with a mad intensity. Her hair is disheveled. Her clothes are spattered with blood - not the seepage one sees when injured, but the marks that one has been near a victim of violence.

She starts to raise her weapon. She screams.

Jamie is going to make herself as small a target as possible while still keeping the good doctor in her sights, crouching behind any available cover, but not actually retreating or loosing visual contact.

As the survivors duck out of the way, Dr. Ling opens fire. She laughs and laughs, unloading the gauss rifle indiscriminantly into bulkhead.

"I think Jamie's going to have to end this," mutters Nathan. Aloud, he yells, "Dr. Ling! What are you doing?"

The woman's response, such as it is, consists of a shrieked set of syllables which Nathan surmises is Chinese.

The gunfire stops. The fact that hard targets protect softer ones seems to have reached her awareness.

Jamie reaches her gauss rifle over the bulkhead that she took cover behild, pointing the rangefinder down at her hands.

Nathan calls out in the ancient version of Dr. Ling's tongue. "Would your ancestors smile on murder?" He keeps it simple - the woman's frame of mind isn't up for translating anything unusual.

Dr. Ling's only response is more screaming. Nathan has no idea if she even processed anything he said.

Jamie takes the extra time to tru and get Dr Ling's trigger hand in teh rangefinder, concentrating as long as she usefully can on that hand.

The scientist shakes his head. "No good!" He knows his voice is giving away his position, but it's not as if that were a great secret. "We aren't gonna get anything out of her unless she's sedated!" He'll leave it to the more military minded of his companions to decide if it's worth the risk.

DeGroot grimaces and considers his pistol. He can't fire it without exposing himself. He looks over at Solak, hoping to catch the woman's attention.

Jamie sees her opportunity even as DeGroot tries to catch her eye. She decides she needs to take her shot, and fires off a full auto shot at Dr. Ling's hand, shots seeingly strike true.

Dr. Ling's scream takes on a new tenor and character as her weapon hand is shredded by Jamie's shot. A high-pitched keening noise replaces the babble of mad Chinese, and she slumps down to the ground.

DeGroot rushes forward and kicks Ling's rifle away, noticing with some numbness that a lot of her hand goes with it. For a split-second her face is overlaid with that of the girl that Solak shot in Kiev... _but this one might live_, he thinks. He reaches down and pulls the woman up bodily, applying pressure to the arteries in her wrist. "Latham! Tourniquet! Now!"

Jamie runs over behind the others, rifle still out, and pointed at Dr. Ling.. She nods to Nathan as he moves to bring the first aid kit. She watches carefully the doctor's movements, "I hope she makes it." She says, with a tone suggesting that she might be trying to convince herself.

With a bit of effort, DeGroot manages to staunch some of the bleeding using one of the ship's first aid kits, fetched by Nathan. The _Moore_ was once used for military purposes and has a sickbay well suited for such injuries, and Dr. Ling looks safe enough to move - but it must be done quickly.

"That was a nice shot," DeGroot says flatly. "Let's go to sick bay. Solak, you lead, in case any of our 'friends' are still aboard."

Jamie nods, which is what she was going to suggest anyway, "Most of the time the best restraints are in the medical bay." She notes, idly, as she leads the way, looking down the corridors for the signs of what actually happened.

While Dr. Ling is carried by the two men, Jamie takes a moment to peek in on the bridge. There she finds La, one of the duty pilots. His head is mostly shot out with the gauss rifle and he's still strapped in. The control boards are stained red, with queer flickerings in the holographics where their emitters have been covered over.

DeGroot hands his sidearm to Latham. "Stay here with her. Try to keep her from bleeding out." The pilot picks up Ling's own rifle. He continues as he replaces the magazine. "I'm going looking for the others." He notices Solak coming back from the bridge... alone. "And I'm guessing that means, if they're here, they're back that way."

Jamie shakes her head, and looks at DeGroot, "If you're going to go, I'll make an announcement..." She pauses, "If you think we've neutralized all threats..."

DeGroot pauses, lowers his rifle. "No. Probably not." He moves over to the intercom terminal. "Let's see what the cameras can tell us."

A crew was left behind on the _Moore_ while the shuttles launched. The archaeologists stayed, along with one other pilot: Kova. They're found, bound and gagged, on the bunks of their cabins.

"I think maybe Dr. Ling is as much a victim as any of us," says Nathan enigmatically.

After a tense examination of the captured members of the _Moore_'s crew, DeGroot cuts them loose, one by one. Armitage immediately begins attending to Dr. Ling. The others, meanwhile, relate more or less what happened.

Dr. Ling lost it, rather abruptly. She took Armitage hostage, used him to force the others to surrender, and had La tie them up. Nobody's sure what happened once they were shut away in their cabins, but they all remember hearing the gauss rifle firing, along with some shouting.

It seems that the good doctor was ranting about the Rapine Storm, how they were coming to get everyone. She attempted mutiny. But rather than give her control of the ship, La locked the controls. She most likely shot him for it.

"So where are the other shuttle crews?" DeGroot asks. "Did anyone else come back?"

Nobody's sure. DeGroot's private key unlocks the ship's controls. He finds that the radio transceiver's been taken offline for routine maintenance - or at least that's the reason filed in the log.

The shuttles respond. They were told via a burst message, in text only, to fly clear of the _Moore_ - the message hints at Rapine Storm activity and mention the loss of the _Amazon_, suggesting the others get whatever cover they could get and hold tight.

In a short amount of time most of the other pilots and some of the techs are back on board. There's been only one loss: La. But without his sacrifice, there's no doubt the shuttles would probably have been stranded from their mothership, easy pickings for whoever did come along.

There's a private chat. DeGroot and Latham lay out what they found, and what they saw. Without this new information, it looks more or less like a woman with a past history of stress went crazy, while some of the crew nearly became the victims of elements of the Rapine Storm. With it, events take on a more sinister cast.

At the end of it, looking haggard, Armitage publically announces a decision. The archaeological work is to be suspended temporarily. Upon immediate protest, he assures everyone that their contracts will still be honored and that he intends to continue. He orders DeGroot to set a course for Rome, where Dr. Ling will be remanded into N.E.G. custody for examination.

This, too, provokes some murmurs. Starkweather is known for taking care of its own. But to this argument Armitage simply shakes his head.

---

The _Moore_ is to be grounded in Rome for a week. During this time, Armitage privately assures DeGroot and Latham that corporate HQ is going to be very carefully reviewing its personnel records. He'll risk no further danger to these people if there's a saboteur aboard.

As the craft settles into its berth, and the shaken crew disembark, they're met by a woman. A girl, really. She's dressed all in white, but more than that: she is white. Not simply Caucasian, or Aryan, or pale, but _white_ - shockingly, starkly devoid of coloration. Eyes, hair, everything. She's a Nazzadi Xenomix: a White.

She watches dispassionately while people file past, but she reaches out to intercept Nathan and draw him aside. "You're him," she announces flatly. "We need to talk."

"I'm who now?" asks Nathan nervously.

"The sorcerer," the woman answers. "I know why I'm replacing Dr. Ling. I'll be your new archaeologist. I'm Lisa Lazarus."

DeGroot has been watching the crew, hoping the saboteur will give himself away, but the appearance of Lisa Lazarus throws his concentration. _Sorceror? What the hell?_ He looks around for Armitage; maybe the Doctor can make sense of it.

"So why do you need to talk to _me_ specifically?" Nathan asks guardedly.

"Because I can still smell the magic they used," explains Ms. Lazarus. "You didn't ward against it, because you didn't know to. You'll need to start setting up regular barriers on the ship, around the ship, around yourselves when you land."

"We're not _stupid_," Nathan says defensively. "We did have the standard ritual wards. Obviously they weren't enough, so obviously we need more. I assume we aren't just going to be fighting the last war, though."

"Wait," DeGroot approaches, voice even. "What magic? Is that how they... got to... Ling? Can you tell who did it?"

Lisa smiles. She's actually sort of attractive, once she does so. "We'll get into specifics later. But I'm glad of one thing. You noticed it too."

Jamie stares at DeGroot. She is not terribly happy with the new arrival. Not happy at all. Fortunately, she left he rifle on the ship this time. FOr now, all she does to temper her anger is stare cold daggers at the woman.

DeGroot isn't sure what she means, and doesn't try to guess. "It was a bad day for us," he says simply. "I'll be at your disposal." He turns and heads up the ramp, the saboteur forgotten for the moment.

"We'll discuss it later," Nathan says, his hackles lowering slightly. "But I'll be glad of the help. _That_ sort of thing isn't my field. Or at least... it _wasn't_, up until now."

"Of course. _Pozegnanie wielu_," says the White girl, and waves as she strolls off.
