# FUTILE OCTAVE 2010-05-29

Voices start to clamor in the audience of the One World Orchestra. The practiced parade-ground rasp of a military man speaking to a crowd immediately cuts in on the sound system. The holographics add a spotlight of sorts to the speaker, who's standing up from the audience and turning to address them now.

"Attention. This performance is now over. Patrons will now exit this establishment in an orderly fashion. Ticket prices will be fully refunded. Under orders of the New Earth Government, you are requested to depart. Transportation will be arranged for you if necessary."

There's a stunned silence, broken by murmuring and whispering from all quarters, but the audience begins slowly to fragment and disintegrate into packs of people, all following the floating exit signs which indicate the doors.

Jamie sighs and stands, her fingers running along the bottong of her dress, smoothing it out over her legs as she gets on her feet. She mumbles, loud enough to be heard by her immediate surroundings, "The NEG, is there anything they can't spoil?" She sighs whistfully. She liked this dress, too.

DeGroot hasn't moved. His military upbringing won't let him slump, but he suddenly feels numb. He wonders where the missing eighth of the orchestra was. He thinks how it must have been in Kiev, and Juneau. _Decent human beings_, he remembers telling Lisa, less than an hour ago. _God, what a bad joke._

__It doesn't take much thought to remember the flyer. The section that was hit was from Seattle. Just down the coastline from Juneau.__

__Jamie turns to Dr Armitage, "Back to the ship, one assumes?"__

__"Won't be our ship anymore," Armitage mutters. "We'll be contacted any moment now. Find a cafe' that's open and we'll wait for the call."__

__DeGroot pulls himself out of his chair, still looking down into the orchestra pit where the Seattle section used to be. "Can we win?" he asks simply, flatly, of nobody in particular.__

__It's a good question for nobody. Nobody seems to have an answer.__

Blandot's is open all night. It's not the usual hang-out for patrons of the arts, which makes it ideal for the Starkweather personnel who've come to attend the show. Armitage, Lisa, Nathan, DeGroot and Jamie have coffee and coffeecake and silence in abundance.

As Armitage is ordering, his phone rings.

He spends a minute or so mostly listening, sometimes acknowledging. "Yes, yes, I'll tell them," is the last he says to it. And he sits down.

"Ladies and gentlemen," he says wryly. "We are now a full and cooperating 'partner' of the Ashcroft Foundation. As a part of the Moscone Agreement of 2082 this means that we have also been immediately nationalized as a civilian contractor to the New Earth Government under the 'special provisional needs' clause." He pulls out his PCPU, flicking digital copies of what must be the document in question to each of his fellow mission members.

Jamie pulls out her PCPU as well, as she feels the familiar vibration on her hip. She taps a few buttons, sending it off to her EC contact, thatn slots the thing down in her pocket again, "That's it boys, we're goin to war?" She asks, in a bit of a sing song voice, but not a light tone.

DeGroot keenly studies the document on his own handheld. It's an odd mish-mash of contracts he's seen as a merc and military regulation. He remains expressionless at Solak's remark; the woman has her own ways of dealing with stress... and he'll take bad jokes over monsters any day.

A thought strikes Jamie, "So, Dr. Armitage. What's special about Seattle, vs. some of the other places we've seen that are no longer there?"

"It's the next stop after Juneau," the professor answers hollowly, and takes a drink from his coffee.

"Out of curiosity... if things had gone as before, where was the next stop on our tour?" asks Nathan.

"He means that the Migou flattened Juneau, now they've erased Seattle," DeGroot says. "And when they finish reloading, they'll go for the next one on their list. San Francisco, Los Angeles, Edmonton, Chicago... take your pick." He sips at his coffee. "We were at war already, Solak. But I think a lot of us didn't know it yet."

Jamie looks at DeGroot, "Maybe it's just the difference between being at war, and being IN war..."

Armitage looks carefully at his PCPU during the conversation. "And there we go," he says after a few moments. "Orders to mobilize. We're going back to China. Under the protection of the _Dreadnaught_."

"That sounds impressive, at least." Jamie quips.

"Do we have an answer to Latham's question," DeGroot asks. "Where we'd go after China... or... do we only find out at each site?"

Jamie says, "Something tells me the NEG isn't going to plan too far ahead. Probably a lot of wasted effort."

Armitage nods. "We already know. Or rather we already know the general details. The _specifics_ of each site are always different, you see. For Kiev we knew a who, for example, but not a where."

"Solak... it isn't in their hands anymore," DeGroot says quietly. "It's in ours. Try to remember that."

Jamie gives DeGroot a look, but thinks to herself. _That's a reassuring way to look at it, at least. I just wish I had that optimism._

Jamie's contacts apparently keep up on the news as well. She receives a private message on her own PCPU in a moment. "There's something relevant to the dig sites themselves, we've found. Ask your sorcerer to examine the wards. Good work, we've uncovered the pipeline."

Jamie peers at the PCPU with inward glee. I think I just got a promotion. She keeps herself composed, and looks up at Nathan, trying to make it seem like this was something she just thought of, "Did you examine the wards at the last site we were at, Nathan?"

Nathan shakes his head. "Not closely. I got as far as 'Bad juju, no go in' and decided I didn't really want to know that much more at the moment."

Jamie arches an eyebrow at Nathan, "Might be something to keep in mind..."

"Do we need to go back there?" DeGroot asks. "I imagine that we'll be going to China in a hurry. But we could just fit in a trip to old Carpathia if we needed to."

"We holographed everything, you know," Armitage mentions. "Nathan, if you're curious about it, you can always go review the records."

"Well, Jamie seems to have a hunch," Nathan says, eyeing Jamie curiously. "It can't hurt to have a closer look at the holos while we're rushing our way back to where angels fear to tread."

---

Nathan studies the holographic recordings, along with his fellow conspirators. He consults, he analyzes, he cross-references, occasionally bringing other holograms to life from different sources and overlaying them on the text he sees.

After a few minutes, he realises that there's something here. But it's going to take awhile.

After three hours, he's sure he's onto something.

And after three days, he.. gives up. Coffee and take-out boxes litter the holograph chamber. People have come and gone, and only Lisa sits in one of the observation chairs, calmly reading The Moon and Sixpence. Finally she looks up.

"It's something you've blanked out," she says. "You're suppressing a memory you need for this. That's all I can tell you."

Nathan blinks at Lisa. "I... don't know what you're talking about," he says leadenly; the way he says it, you don't need to be a parapsychic to know that he's lying. Absently, he pulls out the bottle of the pills he's been taking, rolling it around in his hand.

"Stop taking 'em," the girl suggests absently, eyes on the glowing text before her.

"I know," Nathan says glumly. "Have you seen Jamie lately?"

Lisa shakes her head. "Nope. Try her phone."

Nathan punches in Jamie's ID and waits for a response. "Jamie? I've almost made a breakthrough on the problem, but there's something I need to do before I can make any further progress, and I need to talk to you about it."

Jamie's voice comes back, uncertain and wavering, "Me? Why me...?"

"Because you're the one who got the idea for this little project," Nathan says. "And in order to make any further progress, I'll have to go off my medication."

Jamies tone turns to be a bit, harsh, "And again I ask, what does this have to do with me?"

Nathan sighs. "At first, I thought it was just a random hunch," he says. "Now I know just enough to know it's serious business. _How did you know?_ Was it really just a hunch? Women's intuition?" His own tone, normally placid and unassuming, is growing increasingly urgent.

Jamie panics just a bit. She says into the phone, "Call it women's intuition? Or a little bird told me?" Jamie begins to walk to wherever Nathan is. She's going to need to be there sooner or later anyway.

Jamie walks into the room, she glances at Lisa, then looks at Nathan, "Well, I'm here." She states simply and looks expectantly at Nathan.

"I'm sorry to put you on the spot, Jamie," Nathan says, not sounding very sorry. "But this is important to me. My sanity is on the line here. These," he says, holding up the pill bottle, "are what keeps me from remembering the Dreams. The nightmares." He sighs, dropping his hands into his lap and looking at them. "I suppose after the nightmares I've given _you_, it may seem a little selfish. But that... was something we vitally needed. I just want to know if _this_ will be worth it as well."

Jamie tosses another glance to Lisa before looking at Nathan, her fury .. barely contained compared to what you could suspect happens. "You think that your little daydream gave me pause? Do you even understand what it's like keeping something like I have at bay? Do you? I don't get pills to help me. In my world, you're the lucky one." She sighs, and pulls back a bit. As she is yelling, you can see some of the light-collecting black mist pour off of her legs, for jsut a moment. But the light seem to brighten as she regains her composure. "The little birdy is never wrong, Nathan. Do what you will with that information." She turns, and makes to leave.

Nathan looks at the pill bottle one last time. "That's a good enough answer for me," Nathan says, as he carefully places it behind the holo console.

---

Nathan finds himself falling through the spaces between galaxies. He knows it's a dream, _knows_ it, and yet...

He feels another presence with him. Lisa? Or something else? It feels familiar. And there, somehow 'ahead' of him, a gloating voice begins to speak.

"You have come far, even further than that young man with his army of ghouls and nightgaunts. What have you come to see, I wonder? Will you even recognize it when you do?"

"I don't know," Nathan says. He's never been good at snappy comebacks, and so he takes refuge in the one mode of response that's ever worked out for him: frankness. "I don't even know what I'm looking for in the first place. All I know is that it's important. To me."

"Then by all means search for the unknown. Dance on your strings to a tune you cannot even hear. For I am both piper and puppet master." The voice is gone, though it never had a presence to start with, and somehow Nathan knows that it's simply withdrawn.

Nathan falls and falls and falls for what seems like forever. He does not suffocate, though he does feel a harrowing closeness, a tightening of something about him. The galaxies shift and jump in their places.

Here - a continent. He is both standing on the rocky plateau of some forgotten supercontinent of an Earth-like planet, and hovering in space over that same planet watching events. If this is Earth, then, it must be in the remote past or perhaps an unthinkable future. The water is blue, the clouds are white, but the outline of the continents has shifted dramatically.

With his blurred, fragmented awareness, he somehow sees shapes rising from the water. Octopi with ambulatory limbs, creatures not from earth and denied her blessing. They are the heralds, he knows, and in a moment of horror he knows what they herald.

The priest of the Great Old Ones, He who for a time lay dead in His city. Great Cthulhu has risen from the waves. Like a moving mountain, His vast and flabby bulk emerges and moves, sometimes more flowing than walking across the stone.

And before him, across an area counted in square miles, the clouds of the sky begin to coalesce into the outlines of a human face. And Nathan knows they are speaking to each other, silently. All that is exchanged is thought.

Dreams are not just the random firings of the brain, like the pre-arcanotech scientist thought. Nathan knows this, from his education as a sorcerer. Dreams are, or at least can be, manifestations of real things, though what constitutes 'real' is beyond human imagination at times. This is one of those times. Nathan is horrified, terrified... and yet, the terrible curiosity which led him into the Pyrenees all those years ago is driving him on again. Pushing closer to the behemoths of land and sky, as if to eavesdrop on their conversation.

The colloquy is impossible to put into words. Nathan understands only concepts, ideas, vague notions rather than the specifics. He peers into a deep ocean, seeing the surface and only those fish which flit about at the shallower depths. But he knows that beneath that surface lies unthinkable complexity.

The two forces present here exchange thoughts as equals. One is Cthulhu, without a doubt from Nathan's occult studies. But the other? Humanity. Or some massed avatar of humanity, or some creature representing itself as such. These two entities, then, are exchanging information. Ritual prayers, knowledge of the universe, places and times and beings which quickly threaten to overwhelm the scholar.

Sometimes even Nathan's curiosity has its limits. Besieged by information, by knowledge beyond his ken, Nathan tries to filter the torrent of wisdom. He is not Humanity; he is only one lone human. The gloating voice in the darkness called him a puppet; and he would not have denied that, even if he'd been given the chance to respond. But even a puppet might seek to know who is pulling his strings. Even a puppet might wish to learn the script of the puppet show - but, perhaps, only the section containing his own lines.

The dream pulls back abruptly. Nathan wakes up. Something about that dream - something he missed. Something about the wards themselves.

---

Nathan comes to a start in his bed. It's the wards.

Most of the knowledge of how to bind, summon and otherwise control otherworldly beings has come from antiquity, its true origins lost. These wards didn't. These were _invented_, here. They have no scholarly antecedent.

Nathan wipes the sweat from his brow. "I've been using sorcery other people created all my life," he murmurs. "Whoever bound that tomb... came up with it. By themselves. Drawing from... what? What source of power?" He pulls off the bedcovers, begins pacing around the room. "Incredible. Does this mean... the real treasure of that tomb wasn't the armor or the cup at all? The real treasure was those wards - and what they imply?"
