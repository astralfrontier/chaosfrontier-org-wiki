# FUTILE OCTAVE 2010-07-24

The crew is examining data feeding back from the epochs-old city of the Old Ones. Millennia? Too short by far. Ten thousand years is sufficient to record the history of humanity's latest gasp of civilization, and this maze of hewn stone has stood for orders of magnitude beyond that.

Whole geological ages have come and gone, and its builders must have adapted, changed it or themselves somehow. Their ancestors - or perhaps they themselves, if they were long-lived enough - might have recorded the coming and going of mountains, or oceans. It's almost an obscenity to contemplate.

---

Klaxons sound. This is the alert communication channel, and a screen from _Dreadnought_ opens immediately. "Migou, incoming on five points," the comm officer of that war vessel reports tersely. "Converging directly on our position. We'll be boxed in within twenty seconds."

The crew catch hints of shouting from the _Dreadnought_'s bridge; the channel stayed open. "How did they get here so fucking _fast_?" demands the captain.

Jamie looks around. "I guess that's what they do.." She says. She's trying to keep it a bit cool, but this has put her on edge a bit.

DeGroot snarls and hunches over the _Moore's_ control console, looking for a way out. "Bloody inevitable. Maybe they were already here."

Vital seconds pass. "We couldn't run anyway," admits the captain over comm. "_Moore_ please shelter yourselves under our hull. If they open fire, we'll try to draw their attention."

"I can't imagine fate intends for us to just die at the hands of the Migou," says Nathan - quietly, so as not to distract the pilots. "No, there's got to be something far more interesting in store for us."

DeGroot does as instructed. The smaller ship hurtles over the rubble-strewn glacier with a frantic speed that might match the pilot's own mood. "Button up, everyone," DeGroot instructs. "It's gonna get heavy."

The _Moore_'s sensor board shows five discrete clusters; groups of Migou attack ships. They take up a precisely geometric position around the _Dreadnought_ and her fledgeling. And then.... nothing. They hang there in space, motionless. No weapons vomit forth lightning or emit the peculiar destructive rays previously observed. Apertures and barrels can be seen through magnification as _aiming_ at the _Dreadnought_, but.... nothing.

Visual inspection counts something close to twenty-eight vessels. The Migou ECM is in full effect.

Jamie runs to grab her rifle. She then sits down, and straps herself in, gripping her instrument of long range death in her hands.

Jamie looks at Nathan, "What are they waiting for?"

Through the bridge holograms of the _Moore_, DeGroot can practically count the bulbous, squamous protrusions that count for weapons among Migou spacecraft. "What indeed," he mutters. "Is this a trick?" He scans the ground beneath the paired vessels, looking for the jab to go with the feint. "Maybe they think they can take us alive..."

"Not interested," the captain of the _Dreadnought_ replies firmly.

"Maybe they're afraid we already found what we were looking for," Nathan murmurs. "They know there's something here that called them to account before..."

Jamie nods, "Something is up. THis hardly seems like a normal excersize...."

"Maybe they don't want to damage the Old Ones city. Or maybe they're afraid that we've already found something. In any case..." DeGroot looks at the map, acutely aware that he should have been dead thirty seconds ago. He opens a channel to the _Dreadnought_. "This big round area, in the middle. We could try moving towards it, it would at least give us some cover."

"Something's up, all right," Nathan says, eyes widening, as he turns to DeGroot. "You've got it right, DeGroot. This city is untouched by anything except time. It's a holy place to the Old Ones. And even untold aeons after they left, the Migou have not dared to touch it. They've come here after us, but even now... they don't dare open fire?"

"For the Old Ones, the Migou, and other such beings, there really is only one religion," Armitage murmurs.

Jamie shrugs, "We're all shadows anyway..." She mutters to herself, "Some more than others..."

Nathan looks sharply at Armitage, and visibly shudders.

_Dreadnought_ slowly begins to move, transmitting real-time deltas of its position to _Moore_'s navigation system in the process. The Migou do not visibly react.

"Then what counts as sanctuary for them?" DeGroot asks. "What's the most holy place in this city? That nutter, Danforth, said that this was where they first came to Earth. So where on this map did they first put boots to soil?"

Jamie looks, "I say go down. Ultimately the choices we make are between death now and death later."

Nathan watches the holotank, with the Migou positions marked. "Spectators," he says. "That's what the Migou remind me of, right now. They're _watching_, to see how this turns out." He bites his lip, shaking his head. "Maybe I'm just being jumpy."

Jamie smiles, "Oh, so you're an optimist."

Armitage hums. "You know that has to be it," he says finally. "They can't be afraid of.. well, whatever's in that lake, any more so than people in helicopters would be afraid of an island full of tyrannosaurs. As long as you're smart enough not to _land_ there.."

"We're not that smart," DeGroot says simply. "If we run, they'll blow us to hell. Maybe our best move is to land and... try to find one... for Lisa to work on."

Jamie looks at DeGroot. She jumps from her seat, held down only by the restraints. Her hand clutches aroudn the foreward grip of her rifle, "You want to do... What?"

Armitage blinks. "Are you mad?" he asks calmly.

DeGroot turns in his seat, and looks Armitage straight in the eye. "Not yet."

"You are either joking or stupid," the archaeologist replies firmly. "You are asking _one_ telepath to try and engage with _one_ such mind. There were enough such creatures to destroy a powerful civilization. Say that Lisa manages to hold one, a feat I'm not really inclined to demand of her. What happens when the second one shows up? The third? The twentieth?"

Nathan shakes his head. "Let's just file that one next to 'take our chances with the Migou' and keep thinking, everyone." He scratches his head.

"Maybe... we can escape," Nathan murmurs, his voice hesitant and quavering. "Those... geometric diagrams that brought the Old Ones here. Maybe we can find a geometry that takes us to somewhere not surrounded by Migou." He takes a shuddering breath. "Of course, if we do it _almost_ right, it might take us to somewhere far worse."

Jamie looks slowly at Nathan.. "Far worse... than... this?"

Nathan turns to Jamie and nods. "There are worse things in the universe than Migou," he says with quiet intensity.

"Is that what we came here to find?" DeGroot asks. He waves a hand through the playback window, and recalls the chart, the carving that looked like an astrogation diagram. "Not a device or a monster, but this... spell?"

"We came here to find any hint of what might stop the Migou," Armitage answers thoughtfully. "You know we may have found one thing, in a sense. They are here, and not shooting at us."

"For example..." continues Nathan. "Did you know that a D-Engine is not allowed to operate during Halloween? All D-Engines run off an internal battery during that time; the power apparatus cannot run on the day itself. No one knows why, exactly. But... _things_ happen if you do. Poorly documented things, because few survive when they happen, and no one survives sane."

Nathan swallows, and shakes his head. "If only I knew where that box in my apartment went to, I'd... feel better about this idea."

Jamie looks at Nathan, "There's no way. It's just a day..." However, Jamie sounds unsure, herself. Of course, she's sees.. things, too..

DeGroot considers Nathan's words, and shakes his head. "It makes no sense." He points at the scanner traces of the Migou task force outside. "But neither does that. So. What do we do now?" The paired ships have moved; the Migou task force have failed to respond. "Does it matter that they're in five groups? Is that part of anyone's geometry?"

Jamie looks around, "Is there anythign about being here, now, that makes this... thing you do, easier?" THis question is addressed to Nathan.

Nathan nods to Jamie. "Yes, actually. For one thing, this place might be privileged in the cosmic geometry - it might be the reason why the Old Ones landed _here_, rather than somewhere else. And for another, we might be able to find some clues about sacred geometry here."

"You've saved our ass before," DeGroot replies. "Do you have enough to try it with just what we've seen? Or do we need to find more? Because as long as the bugs aren't shooting, we might as well get the probes back to work."

Nathan shakes his head. "We need more. With what I know right now, if I made a box, we'd be _lucky_ if it went nowhere."

Once more, the probes are dispatched to comb over the city that is in itself a definition of ancient mystery. Most of the crew pours carefully over the flood of sensor data coming back from the swarm, venturing into places no human feet have ever trod... and perhaps where they never should. DeGroot keeps an eye on the Migou, and transmits a summary of the plan to the _Dreadnought_. "They're afraid of what we'll find," he explains. "The diggers here say, let's find it." _And hope it's not worse_, he thinks.

The _Moore's_ holographics flash with a sucession of images and analysis in every possible spectrum - visible, topographic, ultrasound, x-ray. Some is fantastic, such as the depictions of the Old One's art and architecture. Much is blasphemous to human eyes - tableus depicting the wars between the Old Ones and their rogue servitors, full of ruined buildings and mangled bodies. It's easier to read than it should be, as if the very planes and angles imprint a subrosa message on any conscious mind that perceives them. Whatever else these frescos and carvings say, one message is always clear: this is not a place for men of Earth, nor are any of the stars in the sky.

As Nathan reviews the frescoes, another flash of memory illuminates his brain like a lightning stroke - passages from the Pnakotic Manuscripts, which also discussed the Old Ones and, he now understands, their modes of travel. The implications are so disturbing that he is unable to speak for a moment, before saying thickly, "I get it. God help me, I get it."

The key, he explains, is not just a matter of geometry but _mind_. The ritual of traveling requires everyone involved to cast their frame of mind into a very specific manner of thinking. "And I don't think I know a way to explain it," he says, looking at Lisa. "I'll need your help, if anyone else is to travel. But if the ritual works - whoever participates, and does so properly, can slip through the cracks of spacetime."

The returning memories are no comfort. While they offer a solution, one suggestion in particular is unnerving. For the sorcerer acquainted with travel via higher-dimensional shifting such as Nathan proposes, there is no safeguard, no gate barring him from thinking in the manner required. An errant thought or troublesome dream would be enough to dislodge a sorcerer from his accustomed hearth, and staying on the planet Earth in his own time - and perhaps in his own body - stops being an unbreakable assumption of existence. It becomes an act of will.

"There was an old saying: 'Man's mind, once stretched by a new idea, never regains its original dimensions,'" Nathan adds. "In this case, that's not a comforting thought."

DeGroot silences his mike for a moment. "What about the Dreadnought?" he asks. "If we disappear what happens to them?"

Nathan shakes his head. "This is a means of transporting _people_, DeGroot. The _Moore_ will go nowhere. And only a few people can travel this way - as many as Lisa can keep in sync with the sorcerer."

"And if I get it wrong..." Nathan blanches. "There are worse things than death. Or even madness."

Nathan explains further: the choice of destination is defined by the particular set of esoteric angles. The catch that if you don't already know the specific angles for a destination, you can end up literally _anywhere_. "Most of the space we know is the vacuum between galaxies. Apart from being instantly deadly, it has nothing useful to us."

"We know the angles for the place where the Old Ones came from," Nathan continues. "And the Pnakotic Manuscripts mention a few other choices of angles... but say nothing else about those places beyond a name."

DeGroot considers this. "The Old Ones aren't here anymore. Maybe they aren't there anymore, in the place where they came from. It seems about as likely to be hospitable as any other place we only know by name."

Nathan bites his lip. "With the Old Ones, it could be not so much a matter of _where_ they are, as _when_. Still... what you say has merit. We _know_ the Old Ones had whatever it was that forced the Migou to terms. The thing that worries me is that barging in there uninvited might be considered blasphemous."

Jamie looks, "Of course, we are in sort of the type of spot that instantly dead might be an attractive option." Then she turns to DeGroot, "One should not put on a steak costume and walk into the lion's den." She turns to Nathan, "I vote Nathan picks one of the manuscript destinations...."

"It seems you have to be involved," DeGroot says to Lisa. "Where do you want to go?"

The girl frowns a bit. "I.. I don't know," she admits, and shivers a bit. It's the strongest sign of fear anyone's ever seen from her. "But, the Old Ones held back the Migou. That's who we need right now."

Nathan stares off into space. "I'm afraid of visiting the home of the Old Ones," he says distantly. "But I was also afraid of what we would find _here_. I wonder if is my destiny to go into the places that terrify me most."

Jamie nods. "In these times, it is everyone's destiny to face fear."

DeGroot points at the tactical display again. "To hell with destiny," he says. "It's either this way, or that way."

Nathan turns to Jamie. "The general consensus seems to be to visit the home of the Old Ones. But there's still time to consider. Can you think of a reason why we _absolutely_ shouldn't go there?"

Jamie shakes her head, "It is honestly not my choice, but I have no previously-unstated reason not to go." She nods.

DeGroot turns the conn over to Ebony and heads down to the weapons locker. He returns with five complete outfits - body armor with environmental seals, sensor masks, and radios. A trio of sidearms for the scholars and a rifle for himself. Spare magazines, power cells, and ration packs. "Christ," he shakes his head. "Like a trip to the beach. In hell." He returns to the wardroom and hands out the gear.

Lisa begins her work - connecting mind to mind, placing each one in a faint hypnotic state. Nathan can feel her tension. This is something she hasn't attempted before, and she's working under considerable pressure. Still, she has a sort of.. detachment, or serenity, that he finds difficult to imagine. Is it true that all White xenomixes are like this?

Nathan visualizes the angles necessary. The three-dimensional world and its axis of time are not a complete description of reality - there are higher dimensions, some having a spatial quality, others with stranger properties. The aware mind can guide the total entity that is a human being through these dimensions along certain indicative angles, and the three-dimensional body will follow.

The transition is abrupt. The five travelers find themselves in a seething abyss of noise and night. It quickly threatens to overwhelm their sense of place or time or connection, and the others can feel Lisa struggling hard to hold on. And in the next second, they land.
