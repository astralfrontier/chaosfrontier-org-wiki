Light is the first thing - bright, incredibly bright light. A moment later, as the body draws in breath, are the smells. Vivid smells, smells not of the planet, alien molecules borne on alien winds, odors which scream to the body's instincts in a mindless cacophony. Peculiar sounds reach the ears.

The eyes adjust after a moment. The five travelers have come together to some other place. But where? Beneath their feet they feel what resembles sun-baked stone or concrete. Around them they see tall walls, but no roof. Three suns rise in the sky above them, and the color thereof is no earthly blue.

The chamber in which they've arrived is open to the sky, maybe thirty yards in rough diameter, but not perfectly round. Nor any other simple geometric shape; there's an unevenness which slyly implies significance.

Jamie looks around, nose and eyes taking in the new, unworldly sights and sounds. She covers her ears, and looks about the place, "It seems we made it, at least." She pauses, "Or, possibly not." She looks about in the circle.

DeGroot stares up into the sky, and around the chamber. "So... this is what I've always wanted. Well." He slings his rifle. "Here we are." He walks carefully towards the ovoid wall. "Lisa, how do you feel?"

"Oh, we made it all right," Nathan says quietly to Jamie, his spine tingling. "Everything about this plaza screams Old Ones." He chews his lip. "Let's not rush around. Everything here could be vitally important."

"Dizzy," the girl responds after a quiet moment. She wobbles in place, then flops down and pulls her knees to her chest.

Armitage peers about him. "Resembles stone, but no signs of wear," he announces, staring at the floor and walls. Reaching down, he brushes his fingertips along the material. "Seems to be well maintained."

Jamie pulls her hands carefully off of her ears, and nods, "Though, monochrome concrete walls don't seem like they'd indicate... anything." Jamie start to slowly, cautiously move in the direction of one wall. She might get there in a minute or two at this rate, just slowly walking, checking the air.

DeGroot nods. "No dust. So... they might still be here."

"They are here," mutters Lisa. "They are here."

DeGroot looks at Lisa again. "Is she talking to them?" He fingers his rifle sling nervously.

Lisa raises a finger and points in one direction, to the left of party as they had been facing on arrival. "They're coming."

Nathan turns in the indicated direction. "They know we're here?" It's a question, not a statement - though he believes he already knows the answer.

"Let's get out of the middle of the room," DeGroot says. "Stand against that wall -" he points in the opposite direction, "and guard Lisa. But don't point a weapon at any of them."

Jamie nods, "Such wouldn't be unrealistic." Jamie backpedals back to the group, er eyes gazing wildly in the direction indicated, as if the stone itself were going to move. She looks at DeGroot, "I don't expect that small unit tactics will be of much help."

Moments pass. A hole rives itself in the wall to the left, but not violently. The stonework of it seems to crumble into sand or dust, but as it does it pours neatly into two piles - left and right. The wall isn't collapsing. It's becoming an archway.

Jamie blinks and watches with facination. "Wow..." is all she can manage.

Dyer's narrative prepared its readers for what was to come. But the sight itself is still shocking. Five monstrous vegetables given life and animation, waddling blemishes against earthly nature, make their way through the resulting arch. A persistently five-pointed symmetry dominates their features, and their colorations are a grotesque melange from the visible spectrum.

Tentacles, folded wings, pseudopodia, pulsating ridges and other freaks of biology are all exhibited here. These creatures followed not the simple evolutionary pathways of Earth, but are a queer and horrible blend of many such developments. And they approach.

"Caves..." Nathan breathes, his face pale. His eyes roll up into his head and he slumps to the ground like a rag doll.

Armitage peers at the approaching aliens. "Oh blimey," he whispers hoarsely, then drops to one knee and disgorges the contents of his stomach over the alien stone.

Jamie doesn't fare much better, but at least her transition to unconsciousness is quieter than Nathan's. Lisa watches the two collapse, then stares up at the creatures with white eyes.

DeGroot watches his companions falling apart around him; even the stalwart Armitage is affected. DeGroot can barely stand to watch, looking into the glassy red orbs that might be eyes, and the writing cilia 'hair' that might be sense organs no human can fathom. But he reminds himself of the Dyer account. Alien as these things are, they are not inherently evil... perhaps the Migou aren't either, come to that; but the Old Ones aren't currently extirpating mankind. Lisa's dialog with these things might be all that stands between humanity and death; and he's all that stands between them and Lisa. He forces himself to look them in the eyes.

A high-pitched musical piping arises between the aliens, and DeGroot realizes that this is what he has been hearing faintly in the background. There must be more of these creatures elsewhere, and the sound of them is coming over the wall. They split apart, each moving in the direction of one of the party.

DeGroot puts an arm around Lisa and hoists her upright. "If we fight, we die. Do I fight them?" he asks quickly.

Lisa shakes her head quickly. "No, no.... I think.. I think they want to study us," she whispers.

"No worse than what the Migou would do to us, then," DeGroot replies... and waits. It is out of his hands now.

The creatures extend their tendrils or tentacles. One takes hold of Nathan, another Jamie. A third seizes Armitage, who offers a meek token of resistance before being grappled. The fourth and fifth extend their tentacles to take hold of DeGroot and Lisa by the wrists.

---

The group's final destination is about ten minutes away. Jamie awakens midway through to find herself quite securely grabbed by a mass of tentacles; they are extraordinarily strong and supple, holding onto her with care but quite muscular enough to resist any struggle. However, she can also appreciate the view that DeGroot and Lisa have been seeing since their departure from the ovoid room.

That room, it seems, was at the very pinnacle of a tall, dangerously narrow tower which seems to stretch thousands of feet from the ground below. Around it are other such spiraling structures, connected by delicate stone bridges. Taller and narrower than Earthly skyscrapers, radiating an infinite variety of colors from the three suns in the sky, the sight could be called beautiful - if inhuman.

Regular cube-like constructions bud themselves from the sides of these towers, apparently serving as the rooms or apartments of what must be an important city. More such construction can be seen at all altitudes, all the way to the ground. And beyond the extent of this massive alien metropolis, distant mountains rise and brush against azure clouds.

Jamie wakes up, and her hands wrap around the tentacles that have her restrained, pulling and tugging. She yells out, "HELP!" as loud as she can, pushing against the very tight grip that has her caught. She closes here eye, then opens them, too scared to see, but too scared not too..

"Hush, girl!" hisses Armitage. "We're all in this now."

The group files into one of the cube-like buildings, rather large - at least fifty yards across. The center of the room is dominated by a hemisphere filled with what looks like water, and the party is unceremoniously dumped into it.

The building is occupied by other such creatures, who seem busy consulting some of the illustrations which run in a band around the walls of the room. A few cluster together, piping musically at each other.

As he hits the water, Nathan awakens in a flurry of flailing, splashing limbs. "Buh! Wha, no..." he sputters as he manages to get upright with his head above water. Shaking his head, he rubs his face with one hand. "Wha... where are we?"

"Alive," barks DeGroot. "For now."

Jamie dips a hand into the liquid, adn tries to spread her hands through it... "Do you think we can breathe this?" She notes, remembering sci-fi movies.

Armitage sputters about before regaining his composure. He treads water, looking about him. "Scientists," he whispers. "They're scientists. We have to tell them! Tell them who we are, Lisa! They shan't dissect us!" He sounds a little closer to panic than is comfortable.

Nathan nods mutely, his eyes slowly focusing as he stares around the room. "Wow... this is no cave," he says. His gaze alights on one of the aliens and he shudders - the initial shock has passed, but they still disturb him deeply. A thought occurs from the muddled mess of his brain. "Wow... do you think we look ugly to them?"

Jamie shrugs, "I don't think they passed out..."

DeGroot ignores Latham and Solak; his focus is on what Armitage has just said to Lisa, and however the White girl shall answer. _And to think I was worried about the Nazzadi being more fit to survive than me. Well. No need for that anymore._

Lisa nods hesitantly. "Here goes nothing," she whispers. Focusing her gaze on one of the nearby creatures, she starts to mumble to herself.

The creature pauses, halting its strange song with its fellows. It wriggles on its pseudopodia toward the water pool, and begins singing another series of notes. It sounds somehow familiar.

A few minutes pass. Lisa is sweating, and needs to be supported in the water; a trickle of blood emerges from her nose, and her body trembles. But the effort seems to be bearing fruit. Finally the Elder Thing makes a most unexpected sound indeed.

"Thou art from the holy place," comes a voice. A deeply and disturbingly inhuman voice, but quite clearly words in English. And it comes from the thing.

Jamie looks up, and presses against the side of the glass. "That sounds reassuring, at least..."

Nathan has had some time to recover. "The, the holy place?" he asks. "D-do you just mean the city? Or the whole planet?"

"Silence, cur," the voice replies, and a tentacle comes down heavily against the stone next to the pool. "Thou art servitor material, if I appraise thee true. Thou hast developed exceedingly satisfactorily. Indeed, if not for thy deficiencies, thee might supplant the shoggoths in due time."

Nathan's jaw snaps shut, and his eyes are wide as saucers.

"Yes, yes, we are," answers Armitage hurriedly. "Listen, we came from Earth, we found--" The tentacle smashes down again, and the piping pseudo-voice comes at a higher volume. "Know thy place! Thou shalt be examined. Thou shalt answer such questions as are put to thee."

Jamie thinks to herself, . o O ( Well, the order of 'examine then answer questions' seems positive.. we'll be able to answer questions after they're done examining... )

The Elder Thing draws back, wrapping its tentacles around each other in what might be the equivalent of folded arms for a human. "Tell me verily, white one. For what good cause hath those of us in that sacred place sent chattel back here?"

"Uh..." Nathan begins, then closes his mouth again, looking at Lisa.

"They... they didn't," Lisa says softly. "They're dead. They're all dead. The shoggoths.... your, uh, your other servitors. They rose up in rebellion. They .. decapitated your people on Earth."

DeGroot moves next to Lisa, in case this draw the wrath of the Elder Thing. They're putting everything on her; if his last role is bullet-sink, so be it.

The answer comes from the Elder Thing after almost a minute of silence. "Victuals shall be supplied to thee. This matter shall be heard." Without saying more, it wriggles away, toward its fellows, and begins to sing in its native language.

Jamie splashes around a bit in the fluid, moving closer to her companions. She does, however keep her mouth shut.

Nathan sidles over to Lisa. In a hoarse whisper, he asks, "Is it a good or bad thing if they know how we did get here?"

The girl shakes her head and sighs. Responding to sensation, she wipes her nose with one hand; it comes away stained red with her blood. "At least I don't have to open my mind to them any more."

DeGroot finds a place to wait, in the shallows of the pool. "We may have traded servitude to the Migou for servitude to these guys," he murmurs to Armitage. "What would Vreta do in the face of that?"

Armitage faces DeGroot. His face shows signs of desperation and worry. "He'd probably say that the best a soldier can ask for is a good chain of command."

"We did what we thought we had to," he replies. "If we did, and this is all we can squeeze out of this Universe... then to hell with it and everything in it."

Jamie blinks, and thinks about the future... "So, if we get back. Who do we tell what?"

"It depends on what _they_ do about us," Nathan says, glancing at one of the scientist creatures. "If they come back with us, anything _we_ say will be moot. And even if they send us back alone, I'm sure they'll do so with some specific intent in mind."

Lisa winces. Something seems to be discomfiting her, even injuring her in some fashion, but nothing apparent can be identified as the source. "Jerusalem," she whispers. "Old Jerusalem.."

The girl looks about her. "Burning," she manages through rapid breaths. "Parapsychic burn.. I can feel them all.. it hurts.. it _hurts_." She puts a hand to her chest, staring from face to face in the closest thing anyone's ever seen to fear from her. "I can't stop. Please help me."

DeGroot rummages through the field kit, finding an an autoinjector and ampoules of sedative. He loads it and passes it over to Latham. "Got a feeling you'd know this better than me."

Jamie kneels down and looks eye to eye with Lisa, "What do you need to stop? Can Nathan help? Can any of us?" She looks up at the boys preparing the other option.

"Knock me out," the girl whispers. "Unconsciousness. Hurry.."

"I'm not a trained medic," Nathan says, but nevertheless assembles the autoinjector - field medkits are designed to be usable by less trained personnel after all - and administers the sedative to Lisa.

Lisa slumps over, letting out a sigh. Nathan can tell that she'd started to develop a fever, but fortunately the lukewarm water in which the party's been thrown will help mitigate that.

---

The Elder Thing returns in time. Lisa is still unconscious.

"Explain what hath stricken the white creature," it commands, directing a tentacle in DeGroot's direction. "Speak."

"She's a para-psychic," DeGroot says. "The presence of so many inhuman minds pains her." He looks Lisa over, recalls the fever she was developing. "In time, this place will kill her."

"I know not this word which you speak," the Thing answers. "But I take thy meaning. It is the speech of the mind and not the --" and here he makes a truly incomprehensible noise. "The gates of the mind swing wide, and what wills it may enter easily from either direction."

"She said she couldn't stop," agrees Nathan. Questions burn in his mind, but after being rebuked once, he's more than content to let the Old Ones drive the conversation.

DeGroot nods, noting that the thing hasn't invited him to speak further. Nevertheless, he keeps his gaze level.

"Thou speakest truly," says the Elder Thing, directing a tentacle at Nathan. "It is the considered opinion of my learned brethren that this matter hath something akin to the tale which was told of the shoggoths. That allowing such as yourselves to advent upon the holy place would pervert and diminish your bodies and minds. The alignments of that place are truly too much to the walpurgis-rhythm to safely permit such creatures to emerge."

"It was an act of desperation," DeGroot hazards. "An old enemy of yours is now seeking to exterminate us."

"Thou speakest of the shoggoths?" the Thing asks. "Pray do not hold your tongue, but tell me now this tale. Thou art of considerable interest to the physick of my brethren."

Nathan attempts to explain about the Migou invasion. In the process of the discussion, he discovers that the Thing's archaic English dialect is no mere affectation; its vocabulary in English only dates to the 1800s; to discuss anything more recent, he must draw from his linguistic training to construct analogies. He does, at least, manage to convey that, as far as any human knows, the shoggoths remain confined to the 'holy city'.

During the dialogue, Nathan and the others learn something. It seems almost an off-handed thing, something the Elder Thing seems to regard as universally understood. The 'walpurgis-rhythm' that he spoke of is known as an occult concept - it is the noise of the universe that calls the sensitive or the pagan to worship on the sacred days - the solstice, the equinox, May Eve and other such sacred times.

But that's just it. It is a universal force, and yet it aligns with the Earthly calendar. The secret is this: it is simply an emergent property of the Earth's rotation, both about its own axis and about its sun. Nathan comes to realize with a shock that any planet circling any star at similar rates would be similarly aligned with cosmic forces.

"It's like the anthropic principle," Nathan murmurs. "The old cosmologists said that we observed the Earth to be in a particular orbit, and therefore temperature, because if it weren't we couldn't have lived on it. We never dreamed that there could be an _occult_ connection as well as a mere physical one."

"We risked much to come here," DeGroot adds. "We may be the first of our kind to do so under our own power. We've done all we can for our people. Even were we to die now, there is honor in that. But... now I beg to know what you intend to do with us."

"Thou shalt return with us to the holy place," replies the Elder Thing. "There thou shalt be our voice to thine own kind."
