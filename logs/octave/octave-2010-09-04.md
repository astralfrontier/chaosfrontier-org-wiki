Jamie breathes for a moment, after shedding her second skin, as it were, after her little demonstration for Vreta. She regains her composure for a precious few moments, then goes and finds Armitage. She looks at him, "Vreta gave me permission, we have urgent news to discuss..." She looks grin, even without the horrific outer crust. "We should probably assemble the key players..." She begins.

The crew, as it were, is gatherer into a meeting room, and Jamie tells them about the OIS. How the OIS are now most likely coming after us, as the agents involved in the sale of the pervious pieces were all arrested on pretty trumped up charges. She pauses for a moment, then looks around the table. She also explains about FUTILE OCTIVE, the weapon the the Migou were developing that could not only kill human life on Earth, but possibly wipe out the Deep Ones as well.

Jamie finishes, "I assume the OIS knows where we are, anywhere we might normally land, and will come after us." Her fist clenches...

Nathan sighs and presses his hand to his face. "You know, it's almost a bit of a letdown. To go all the way to Antarctica, and then to _another world_... and then we get back and a bunch of corrupt cops want to put us away."

"Yeah, typical," DeGroot mutters. "Besides, one look at the 'Ambassador' and they'll think we really have been consorting with demons. So what are our options? We can go to the next dig, because I doubt they'll follow us into any of these hellholes. Or we can try to deal with these guys before they catch up to us.

"The _Dreadnought_ will be following us," points out Nathan. "And their orders can reach the _Dreadnought_."

Jamie looks at Nathan, "Of course, we don't ultimately know if they'll be followed. Vreta is, or was NEG, and didn't arrest me immediately." She looks, "I would like to .." She doesn't finish her thought, though, simply looking down.

Nathan rubs his chin. "Well, we can't make people not be foolish, so we'll need to pursue a different approach. Even if it _did_ let us escape their reach, I'd just as soon not spend the rest of my life lurking in the most dangerous corners of the world."

"So what _can_ we do about this?" Nathan continues. "I have no idea how the process is supposed to work, or how - or even whether - there's any sort of check on the OIS getting it wrong."

Armitage speaks up. "The best thing you can do right now is to try and change the game. Give them the Elder Things to worry about. Give them what we've learned about the dig site."

Jamie looks at Nathan, "In my experence, TRUTH or getting it wrong doesn't matter to the OIS. Obviosuly resistance if proof of guilt. Besides, It's not as if we're innocent..."

Armitage just smiles. "There are no innocents. Only sacrifices in our war against the Migou. Some more willing than others."

Nathan scratches his head. "Leads me to wonder where those artifacts were, after Selene Grayman bought them but before they turned up in NEG hands. Hell, who knows, maybe the OIS is just honestly trying to root out the Death's Shadow contacts. Stranger things have happened."

Jamie shrugs, "It's not likely." She ponders, "Unless we actually have contacts in the OIS, I doubt there's much we can solidly do."

DeGroot says, "The OIS is a large organization. Perhaps we can find a faction within it who will be sympathetic to our cause."

Jamie blinks, "We're half magicians and other assorted lots, I'm sure the OIS would greet us with open arms."

Jamie looks, "So we go to America, and present the Elder Ones we found?"

Armitage nods. "Not just exhibit them like a circus show. I don't think they'd permit that, regardless. No, more than that - make the case that _these creatures_ can help us win the war, because that will trump almost anything else the OIS can say at this time."

"It makes about as much sense as anything else," DeGroot mentions. "The NEG would want to normalize diplomatic relations with them anyway. For whatever sense that will make to the Elder Ones."

"So who do we say this to?" Nathan asks. "That's the crucial question. I doubt the OIS personnel who book us will be interested. It's not as if I know anyone in high places - or even _know_ anyone who knows anyone in high places, except for you, Dr. Armitage."

The scientist drums his fingers against his forearms. "I think we've imposed on Field Marshal Vreta quite enough at this time," he concludes. "We'll go through corporate. Bear in mind, ladies and gentlemen, that your new employer is a defense contractor and regularly deals with the military at a high level."

"Besides," he adds with a smile. "This sort of archaeology - if it doesn't get us arrested or fired - is worth a very, very substantial bonus."

"Let's do it, then," DeGroot says. "The sooner we get this done, the sooner we get back to digging. Who wants to ask our guest?"

Jamie looks at Nathan. "They seem most familiar with you, anyway..."

Nathan grimaces. "Thanks a lot, Jamie. Need I remind you which of us _passed out_ just from _seeing them_, and didn't wake up again until he was dunked into a pool of water?"

Jamie says, "I seem to remember that was both of us....""

"I wouldn't know - you woke up earlier than I did." Nathan grins uneasily. "Fine, fine, I'll do it. I'm just not sure how I'm going to explain to them how politics works amongst us stunted beings - or why they should care."

DeGroot can't help but grin; he stayed on his feet. But it fades quickly. It was a near thing, and if not for Lisa, they'd all be dead. Or worse. "C'mon, guys. We're little more than yapping dogs to them anyway. Still..." He pauses. "I have to wonder what kind of people, could alter the... I dunno, 'spell', I guess... that keeps the Earth at this length of day and year. Guys like Svygotar, you know, from the tomb in the Carpathians.. What would they have thought of him?"

The English-speaking Elder Thing and his two companions have tended to gravitate to the _Moore_'s central section. They seem to prefer open spaces and tend to move about aimlessly when not otherwise engaged.

Nathan swallows and braces himself before entering the section. To say that he's 'accustomed' to their presence is overstating the case - he's merely reached the point where he doesn't pass out, vomit, or have panic attacks just from looking at them. Steeling himself, he enters, and asks, "Sirs, I would speak with you. I bear questions, and news."

"As thou hast sought, we are here. Dread not to speak," replies the Elder Thing calmly, while its two companions sing quietly to each other.

As the creature speaks, Nathan's immediate concerns are overtaken by another thought. "Actually... I'm curious about something. Why do you speak English in... well, I'd have to call it an archaic fashion? English speakers haven't used words like 'thou' or 'thee' in centuries. How did you learn our language?"

"Thou art not the first to come to us," the Thing answers. "In thy world's past time, a thing present indeed when considered by our loremasters, the witches and warlocks of thy world would be taught the secrets of the transportation by which thee came upon our abode. Many fled from persecution by their own number, either giving great offense or receiving it, and some would treat with us for further knowledge." The Thing's cilia wave gently. "We found it profitable to learn of this place to which our kin had adjourned and amused ourselves with the practice of it."

"Hah," says Nathan quietly. "The more things change, the more they stay the same." Somewhat more firmly, he continues: "I've received news that myself and my companions are soon to face similar persecution." He explains, briefly, about the decidedly non-occult armor and artifacts found in the Carpathians, and that the OIS - "those whose nominal mission it is to protect our weak spirits from the occult" - are tracking down anyone who had anything to do with the artifacts.

"We aren't sure why the OIS is _really_ investigating this," Nathan continues. "It is true that the artifacts were, at one point, sold to a group of people that we call Death's Shadows - a particularly vicious band of cultists. But if things continue in this fashion, it seems likely that myself and my companions will not be able to continue our investigations, or to speak with you."

The Elder Thing listens, but its alien body language is beyond unreadable. At least, for Nathan's peace of mind, it doesn't seem to move around that much. "A shame. When you retreat from this world as other witches have done, then, may you find the fortune they enjoyed," the thing replies at last.

"We're trying to avoid that option," DeGroot says. "Human lawgivers are fractious, and come and go quickly. We believe that, if you will consent to dialog with a few of them, that the others will stay their hand. Or at least, confusion will result, and provide an opportunity to continue our mission. Will you allow it?"

The Thing confers with its colleagues for a few moments. Finally it speaks intelligibly again. "Thou hast until our fellows in the southern city hath concluded their investigation, then," it announces. "But that matter hath greater weight with us than treating with thy kind."

"I figured," DeGroot says. "Personally, I can't stand our rulers either. How long do you expect we have?"

"It hinges on what else must be done. They will avoid the shoggoths beneath the depths until more is known." The Thing sings again to its fellows. "Perhaps a turn of this world around its star will be enough to fully learn this tale."

"A year, then," Nathan says, putting it in terms that he's more accustomed to. "Well, that's more than enough, I should think. I doubt it'll take anywhere near that long for the OIS to deal with us, or vice versa."

"Or the Migou," DeGroot adds.

Armitage, as the senior authority aboard with regard to Starkweather, makes the call. The others can hear him talking, sometimes shouting, from within his private quarters aboard the _Moore_. Finally he opens the door.

"Alright," he says, mopping his brow with a hankerchief. "The board is on hold. Get your friend over here. And stay quiet."

The video screen lights up. The board of directors of Starkweather come into view. The Elder Thing wriggles forward. The immediate, visceral fear is clear. Even fully warned of what they were to see, probably with photos ahead of time, the Thing's influence is powerful.

"Dr.. Armitage.. is that.. " begins one of them. Armitage clears his throat. "Ah, yessir." Another member of the board leans forward, looking past Armitage on the screen - he seems to address himself to the Thing. "We've been briefed, sir, on your species and its history on Earth. The board has approved some prepared remarks." Consulting a glowing screen before him, he begins to read.

"First, we do not speak for the entirety of our species, only ourselves. Given that, we wish to extend our full cooperation to you and your kind. In return, however, we are extremely interested in the preservation of our homeworld and people against the attacks of the Migou, with whom you have had some previous dealings."

"Second, it is imperative that we exert effort to ensuring your safety in the light of recent events, and against the Migou or Deep Ones who may attack the craft on which you travel. To that end we ask that you continue to accompany them to North America, at which point we'll--"

He's interrupted by someone else on the board. "O-10 is on the horn, sir," says a flunky quietly, leaning over. The director clears his throat. "Pardon the interruption. A necessary notification. The Security Council of our government is now in communication with us." The screen bifurcates; a new group of men and women have come into play.

"Shit on toast," breathes one member of the Council. "We're fully caught up, Starkweather," announces one of the Field Marshals brusquely. "Thanks for the feed."

More conversation happens between the two parties. "Bob, listen--" "--need to appraise--" "--the antarctic disappearances--" Finally the Security Council's chairman gavels them into silence. "_Moore_, does your.. guest have a name?" he asks calmly.

The Elder Thing, who has been watching and listening, now speaks. "Thou canst not sing, it seems," it explains. "My trade within mine own kin is the learner of tongues and student of travelers and animals. If thou needst a name by which to distinguish me from this rabble, then, I am 'Mister Singer'."

The Security Council takes this pretty well in stride. The chairman speaks again. "Very well. Mr. Singer. A pleasure to meet you, ah.. " He shrugs it off and continues. "If I understand this correctly, your people visited our world in our distant past. We'd like to speak to you now and make you welcome. We can help you answer questions. But we need you to come with that crew there to Chicago. Will you do this?"

Singer pipes musically at his fellows for a few moments. He speaks again. "It will be done."

Jamie 's face is slightly impassive at the verious news. She looks up at Mr. Singer, and simply keeps her mouth shut. What a day she has ad...

The Security Council dismisses the _Moore_ - but not the Starkweather board. There's a few seconds of chatter that comes through while the _Moore_ disconnects, apparently the beginnings of a heated discussion between the two. A moment later the flight authorization comes in - orders for the _Moore_ to proceed directly to Chicago under escort of the _Dreadnought_. No deviations permitted.
