# FUTILE OCTAVE 2010-10-02

The _Dreadnought_ and _Moore_ make their wary trip across the ocean. They fly high, at minimal power, with only passive sensors operating to escape detection from whatever might lurk in the watery abysses beneath. Two hushed stars darting across the canopy of endless night.

The northern approach is no good. _Dreadnought_'s navigator plots a zig-zag that will take the two craft up past the Baja peninsula, past the still-glowing wreckage of Tijuana, well past the Nevada Zone, then north to Chicago.

The radio receives the expected signal. A lifeless, monotonic voice droning out its death sentence: "Entrance to Nevada Zone airspace prohibited. Violators are sentenced to summary execution. Entrance to Nevada Zone airspace prohibited. Violators are sentenced to summary execution. Entrance to Nevada Zone airspace prohibited..."

The night contains only two other broadcasts. First, a short sharp series of clicks which _Moore_'s computer identifies as a NEG cipher but cannot interpret. The second is an all-night radio program broadcasting from somewhere in Texas or Oklahoma. "They're coming for us all, man!" the MC announces. "It starts in the vertebrae, the fungal tendrils growing out of the spine, seeping up into the brain, into your _brain_..."

---

The two ships receive clearance for Chicago airspace, and both settle into the berths at the military dock. A squad of soldiers, guns at the ready, are standing by to receive the crew as they disembark. A special tunnel, made of metal support struts and covered in tarp, is quickly being erected between a waiting hovertruck and the _Moore_'s airlock. Someone doesn't want someone being seen.

Jamie stands verviously, her breathing labored still.. She looks at their, special guests, holding herself with as much confidence as she can muster. She looks at DeGroot and Nathan.

Nathan chews his lip and studies the covered walkway. _A sensible precaution,_ he thinks to himself. Not for the first time, he wonders if asking the Old Ones to speak to the NEG was a good idea - even though being 'disappeared' by the OIS was the likely alternative.

DeGroot stays close to the speaking Elder Thing, the one who identified itself as 'Mister Singer'. It's not easy - he recalls a movie monster from when he was a kid. 'Triffids'. But if Singer dies, so might the rest of them. Singer says nothing by way of reply, but DeGroot wonders if some of those cilia can taste the balance of fear and adrenaline.

The NEG troops herd their charges into the truck. It's a civilian vehicle for hauling cargo, fitted with steel chairs and seatbelts. The soldiers even made some halting accommodations for securing an Elder Thing, a courtesy Mr. Singer partakes of without comment.

"Sir, our orders are to escort you to the Defense Dome and debrief you and your crew," one of the soldiers explains to Armitage, who nods impatiently. People secure themselves, and the truck lifts off.

---

The conference room inside the Defense Dome is a sprawling affair, seemingly open to the sky, but that's a lie. The Chicago skyline and simulated sunlight are intense and realistic, but every so often there's a minor glitch in the holographics that gives it all away. Still, it's a comforting illusion.

Represented are members of the Security Council: two O-10s, plus their O-9 adjutants and a handful of O-8 personnel. Every major agency has also sent a handful of delegates: the Global Intelligence Agency, the Federal Security Bureau, and of course the Office of Internal Security.

One of the OIS personnel - identifiable as such from the badge he wears around his neck - steps forward after some of the small talk has died down. "This is not a trial," he announces frankly. "You're not entitled to one. This is us deciding what to do about that." He points an accusing finger at Mr. Singer. "And at this shitstorm you've decided to excavate for us. My office is tasked with regulating all nonterrestrial entities, which very definitely includes this guy. We're running this show and I expect full complaince from every one of you."

Jamie , standing by Nathan, looks at the pompus ass carrying on as if our friend couldn't kill everyone in this room with a thought. She can't help but smirk at the thought. She leans over and whispers to Nathan, who's behind her, "It takes some balls to yell at God, eh?"

Nathan shakes his head quietly. He isn't much interested in drawing any more attention from the OIS than strictly necessary, but he does _think_ that Mister Singer can take care of himself. And speak for himself. And that if _he_ thinks the NEG officials are getting out of line, they'll find out very quickly.

DeGroot keeps his face neutral. It would be premature to assume the OIS man is short-sighted; these are the guys that have to keep Death's Hand and Deep One infiltrators in line. _But if the crew of the_ Moore _is no more than lap-dogs to Singer, then this guy must look like he's rabid. This won't go well._

The agent isn't deaf. "You. Jamie Solak, yeah? You're on our shit list already. The only reason you're here alive at all is because of your family situation, so be grateful." He clears his throat. "I'm Special Agent Schroeder. I know all of you already. The humans anyway."

Jamie shrugs at the agent. On the OIS' shit list? She's quaking in her boots. She gives Mister Schroeder a winning smile.

Schroeder goes on. "Since you are all ass-deep in FUTILE OCTAVE anyway, and since everyone _else_ here is actually, y'know, _cleared for it_, we're gonna talk about that."

"Ever since the early 20th century, our predecessors in law enforcement have been coordinating with each other on information about the Cthulhu cult and other enemies of humanity. Earlier contacts were sporadic, but more importantly, communication infrastructure was too low-bandwidth for them to trade data on what basically sounded too crazy to care about. If we'd not been so blind back then, the Arcane Underground might not be the thriving pit of vipers it is today. But that's another story."

"Creatures like Cthulhu, and its followers, and other beings like Yog-Sothoth, have sometimes been associated with plans to, uh, carry the Earth off somewhere. This was usually pretty vague - our problem is that the people implementing these plans didn't have a clue what they were doing. All they got were scraps of information."

"Well it seems that your dig sites are temples to Yog-Sothoth's lesser, uh, manifestations or sub-selves or something. The Migou learned about this. They apparently started planning to use this to move the planet out of the habitable band around the star. Without the Sun keeping it warm, the Earth would freeze, the oceans would freeze, and everyone would be fucked all around. You with me?"

Jamie simply nods her head. SHe had only really heard or figured out half of this, so she listens to what the Agent says.

DeGroot maintains his silence. Singer also said that ancient humans once used the temples to fix Earth in the habitable band in the first place; but if the OIS man doesn't know that, he's not going to want to find out now.

Schroeder goes on. "Thing is, they only came up with this plan - or started putting it into action, either way - after Ashcroft came across the first site. That's when your boy Armitage, or whatever he calls himself these days, got approval to go off and dig up the others. Migou blanks were found infiltrating Ashcroft's dig teams. They were pretty interested these sites and any relics from these sites. So we figure they had to have heard about it from someone. Someone like you guys. Someone like a spy already planted in Ashcroft. See where this is going?"

DeGroot takes the interrogative as permission to speak. "Sir, with respect, is the conclusion the Migou are using us as pawns to enact FUTILE OCTAVE? To do their digging for them?"

Schroeder smiles. He's got teeth like a shark when he does. "Yeah. That's exactly it, Mr. DeGroot."

Jamie peers. "They certainly shot at us a lot for people doing their work for them." She says. I mean, they can't be right, can they? They're the OIS. She clenches her fist beside herself as she remembers...

DeGroot nods. "But if that's true, it's had an unintended consequence." He hooks a thumb over his shoulder at Mister Singer. "Insofar as the Migou are frightened of anything, they're frightened of _them_. They won't touch the... uh..." He stops, and shrugs; whether he's cleared for this or not isn't going to affect their survival. "The Antarctic ruins. Or, I suspect, any ground where the Elder Things choose to stand."

"Well nobody's plans have gone exactly to spec this year, have they?" replies Schroeder curtly. "And that's why you're here instead of up against the wall. Because we need data that you can provide. But I know this. Not one of you motherfuckers is clean." He gestures in Jamie's direction. "Take her for example. Her brother was an inhuman monster wearing human skin. So was her dad. Her _adopted_ dad - that's why we left her alone. Mr. Latham here is poppin' pills to keep himself from remembering _something_. That something could be orders from his handlers, or something else. And let's not even get started on you, Armitage."

Jamie glares at Schroeder, Stamping her food, "My Brother Was Not a Monster!" She screams. She feels something welling up inside of her, that she tries to push down. Visions before her eyes af the Agent sprawled out, red ichor leaking from his body, lying there. She swallows, and closes her eyes, trying to fight the urge back down. Not here. Not now. No.. Death. No.. kill...

Schroeder smirks. "We still got him. You want to see?"

Jamie's eyes slit open, and look at Schroeder, She grits her teeth, and speaks slowly, as if the words pain her, "I don't think that would be healthy for either of us right now." She shakes her head, still trying to fight herself from making a .. fatal mistake.

"If we're dirty, is this act meant to prove you're 'clean', Agent Schroeder?" DeGroot interrupts, putting a restraining arm in front of Solak. "You're OIS. You've stared into just as many abysses as us. You know what that does to someone."

"Yeah, we know. And we have protocols to keep it controlled," Schroeder responds calmly. "That's why we're in charge of security for the whole planet, and you're piloting a half-assed crew transport full of ex-cons and terrorists."

Armitage finally speaks up. "Ladies and gentlemen of Starkweather. Attend closely. This is what interrogation looks like. If he gets you angry and you lash out, he's got you. Calm yourselves. We're on the same side. This isn't the true face of Special Agent Schroeder. It's a mask he wears, it's his job to rile you."

Jamie smiles as she hears this from Armitage, "I guess it's important to do what you love."

DeGroot shrugs. "I've done his job. So, sir," he turns back to Schroeder, " If you tell me what you're fishing for, I'll give it to you. If you want to hang us, then please get on with it. Either way. Professional courtesy."

"Myself, I've nothing to hide," says Nathan. "Or rather... nothing I _want_ to hide. Agent Schroeder, you'll be interested to know that I stopped taking my medication shortly before we reached Antarctica. Let's find out together what I didn't want to remember."

Schroeder shrugs. Armitage seems to have called his bluff. "All right then."

---

The story as told takes a few hours, with little repetition. Schroeder, and the specialists from other teams who join him in the questioning, are experts at questioning and note-taking.

Special Agent Schroeder tabulates and cross-references in the last few minutes. Finally he speaks. "So basically we have you for violating NEG restricted airspace, conspiracy, distribution of restricted artifacts, a few other charges that'll get you killed five or six times each. But since you so graciously agreed to join our big happy family, none of that probably matters."

"By the sound of it, it's this fellow in Lisbon, the one working with Selene Greyman's woman Ward, that's the next link in the chain. There's really no reason you would have found out about that if you hadn't snuck off."

"Did the same guy also hire Spence to screw us over in Mongolia?" DeGroot asks. "Or was that just bad luck?""

"Funny thing about that," Schroeder answers. "That was apparently the Children of Chaos tryin' to put a hit on you. Probably because of your involvement in FUTILE OCTAVE. Based on what you said, Sal here thinks that the Cult wants the Earth to stay where it is so their master's plans can come to fruition. So they'd of course be opposed to FUTILE OCTAVE succeeding. They came to the same conclusion we did, that you were being used to make it happen."

DeGroot doesn't ask further. _Sometimes they all really are out to get you._

Jamie just shakes her head, and looks at the special agent. "So? Were we?"

Schroeder shrugs. "Indirectly, probably. You had one spy on board, but he's with the Children. We ran the rest of your guys from the _Moore_ that you offloaded to _Dreadnought_, probably for the best when all's said and done." He glances at the Elder Thing, still quietly observing. "Anyway, none of them show any traces of being blanks."

"At this point," Nathan says, "I wonder just how many of our problems would be solved if we _did_ move the Earth. To somewhere habitable, but in the 'wrong' alignment. I for one am _sick_ of the Earth being the center of the universe."

Schroeder smirks a bit. "That remains to be seen. Our immediate next move is the arrest of every member of Starkweather who has access to your flight plans and data. Any one of them could be a Migou blank, reporting on the locations of the dig sites. Let's stop them from moving the planet before we talk about doing so."

Jamie looks up at Schroeder, "Are you still going to show me my brother?"

The Special Agent pauses. "Yeah. Yeah, we can arrange that."

Jamie just nods. That should do nicely.

---

Schroeder is still working through the larger issues brought to the NEG's attention. He details Special Agent Tim Sutherland to escort Jamie.

Jamie looks at Tim. "What did. HE" She stresses the work, clearly she wanted to use others, "...mean about my father?"

Sutherland's called for a car. As the group waits, he calls up information on his PCPU and reads it intently. "Your, ah, your father and brother are listed as dangerous extraterrestrial creatures. Human rights revoked by court order, ah, a few years ago, immediately after their individual arrests. Brother taken first, father picked up two weeks later attempting to fly to the Caribbean."

This susprises even DeGroot. "Damn, man. I've never even _heard_ of that happening to anyone."

Jamie looks sidelong at Sutherland, "Dangerous. Extraterrestrial. Creatures.?" She looks, "That.. not..." She almost breaks out in tears, "What sort? What does that even MEAN." She starts to yell again.

"It, uh, it means just what it sounds like, Miss Solak," the agent answers, peering down at his PCPU again. "Creatures which are not human in biological or psychological terms."

The Agent turns to DeGroot. "It, ah, it's more common than you think. Unfortunately. We try to avoid scaring people."

"Yeah, I see that," DeGroot says softly, trying to put a hand on Solak's shoulder... gently. "Maybe we should just go see the guy, and leave the bad news until there's whiskey around."

"Sounds ominous," Nathan comments as he hurries up. Glancing apologetically at Jamie, he adds, "Mind if I join you? I don't think I'm much use to anyone's investigation until I start remembering something."

"Yes, I'm aware of that. I'm also, recently violently, aware that.." She assumes a lecturer's tone. "Extraterrestiral creatures come in many shapes sizes, original, etcetera." She pauses, "I'm asking of what nature you BELIEVE my brother and father TO BE." She nods absently to Nathan.

The car pulls up. Sutherland ushers everyone inside. He follows, signalling to the driver - a human male, present mainly to add security that an LAI navigation system couldn't - to pull away. "Well, ah, it's an inherited condition which we've come to learn about and catalog. They're called dhohanoids."

Jamie's head whips around when she hears this. She looks, "You said.. Dhohanoid?" She looks, and repeats.. "Dhohanoid...." She looks down at her hands. "You don't say...." She shakes her head, "Can't be true... can't be.." She says, but weakly. She will, of course, find out soon enough.

---

Sutherland signs the group in through security at the Ministry of Order, the OIS headquarters in Chicago. He has a biometrically-secured keycard that directs the elevator into one of the sub-basements.

The doors open and Sutherland leads the way out. "You know I don't ah, I don't talk to them, myself. The dhohanoids I mean. But you'll find the security chief for this section just down the hall." He points the way. "He'll call when you're ready to be escorted back up." And he steps back into the elevator. "Compartmentalization, you know."

Jamie can hardly walk, really, and is more or less being lead around in a daze. She smiles weakly as she hears this last, "Oh, right. You partner said. THe watchword and all that..." She tries to mock, but finds herself falling short.

At the end of the hall, a man in NEG uniform buzzes the group through a security door. "First office to your left," he mumbles.

Waiting in the first office to the left is a handful of men and women. But Jamie recognizes one of them immediately. It's Sasha. "Imagine my surprise," he says with a warm smile.

Jamie blinks, and looks up. "Wait..." She pauses, "YOU?" She looks at him, the tears in her eyes, "You... You are here? What in the hell are you doing?" She shakes her head, tears in her eyes, starting to stream down her cheeks.

Sasha grins. "Some mutual friends told me you were heading down here. I thought I'd see what was going on." He withdraws a GIA badge from his pocket and presents it.

Nathan looks between the two, feeling an urge to intervene. "Excuse me," he says. "What _is_ a dhohanoid, anyway?" he says, looking straight at Sasha.

Jamie's face is still covered in tears, "So you knew?" She asks. "I mean, assuming those pigfuckers are correct... and YOU KNEW?" THis last is a scream. She hardly looks at the badge as it's presented to her.

Sasha's face composes itself into a more neutral mask. "I'm here to find the truth, same as you." He glances at Nathan. "A dhohanoid is a creature of darkness, a very evil and wicked thing. Think of it like the ascended form of a cultist, like an extraterrestrial werewolf."

DeGroot stands behind Nathan, looking nervously towards the door, ready to pull them both through it if Solak ... or this Sasha... gets violent. _Boy doesn't know when to stop asking questions._

The OIS staff here have been printing out security badges, and now present them to Sasha and the _Moore_'s crew. "Authorized for 30 minutes. Please proceed down the hall," one says.

Jamie looks up at Sasha, so far ignoring their companions, "So are they all clean?" She nods at the other people in the room apart from Sasha. She tries to compose herself, sniffing back her tears a bit. She rips the badge out of the officials hand, and shoves the tethers at the others, "Let's walk..."

Nathan accepts his badge absently, still casting wary looks at Sasha. "You seem awfully amused by the situation," he mutters under his breath. Under the circumstances, he finds that _extremely_ suspicious.

This area turns out to be a prison complex. But these aren't conventional prison cells. After inspecting the first couple of chambers, the nature of the incarceration becomes clear. The people here - or former people - are being held in a sort of cryogenic suspension. DeGroot recognizes the technology. It's a spinoff from the early days of intersystem space exploration.

The group, along with their escort, arrives at two adjacent cells. There's already a man waiting here. As the OIS escort steps away, the man turns around and smiles. And Jamie recognizes him, too, but not by name. Nor should he be here at all. He is the Egyptian-looking man who she encountered briefly in the hotel in Rome, when she was trailing Rasael Ward. Why is he here?

Jamie's eyes look over the man.. She lifts an eyebrow, looking over the man's form. "Wait.. YOU!" She looks back to Sasha, "Another surprise for me? Today is just full of surprises. First I find out that my life is a lie, and now some random guy in an elevator returns to.." She turns back to the egyptian looking man, "Do what, one questions..."

Sasha's eyes are wide as saucers. This was apparently not in his program either.

DeGroot has one eye on Solak's exchange, and the other on the cryocells around them. This is just like the old legends about Roswell and the Nevada Zone, when it was called Area 51; frozen alien corpses... and other things that don't die... he's reminded of Mister Singer, and the Dyer Report... he shudders, puts his back to the things, and pays more attention to Solak and the short man.

"You don't recognize me," the Egyptian says smoothly. "Understandable. I'm the Director of the Chrysalis Corporation. It's a pleasure to meet you all."

Jamie takes a step backwards, and flanks next to Sasha. She takes a step sideways, then smiles, "I'm sorry, I've never had the pleasure." She nods, cutly, "Isn't this a little low rent for you?" She reassumes her sarcastic personallity, it's always safe to stick with that you know. She is, of course, scared out of her mind.

"I'm on an inspection tour," the Director answers. "We manufacture the cryo-pods the OIS uses. So of course I'm quite interested in their operation, especially given how unsafe the contents could be."

Jamie looks to Sasha, then stats up a little straighter. "It would, of course, be unfortunate for any of them to fail in an untimley fashion." She smiles, "Or fail to keep their contents in... prestine condition." She says, simply talking. Talking is good. No death.

"Ah, let me give you my card," the Director offers. He extends a business card. On it is his name. "I should be off."

Jamie scoffs, and pulls a hanky out of her pocket. She smiles, why she carefully takes the card, with the hanky wrapped around it, "Sorry about that. I have a bit of a germ phobia. Never know what you can catch from it."

The Director waves casually. He's nearly to the other end of the hall when he speaks again. "Best of luck with that prison break, by the way. We did build in a remote release system. Probably a mistake." Jamie looks down. Wrapped in her hanky is a small electronic device. It has one button. Her thumb is already depressing it.
