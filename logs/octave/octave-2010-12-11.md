# FUTILE OCTAVE 2010-12-11

> (OOC) Log "Octave-2010-12-11" started by FallGM at Sat Dec 11 19:28:52 2010 CST (OOC)

The Tagers' armored van whines to a stop, its gravitics keening at the savage stresses the driver places on them. Here at the port, _Dreadnought_ is waiting.

> (OOC) FallGM says, "immediate goal is the remaining dig sites. You guys have talked about obtaining a sifter to do the digs, or improvising one from available a-pod tech."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "decide which goal you want to pursue, or 'other'."

> (OOC) Jamie says, "We should probably spend an hour or two trying to see how hard it would be to get a real sifter. We probably have enough friends to make aquisition likely."

> (OOC) Nathan says, "And while you're spending that hour, Nathan can spend an hour of his own with the sifter blueprints and specs and evaluate his odds of accomplishing /that/."

> (OOC) Nathan says, "If we have those."

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Well... we have Latham, the only expert on such a thing available. On a ship the size of the /Dreadnought/ he can surely find a-pods to use as raw materials."

> (OOC) Nathan says, "Which we should, if the sifter is Starkweather hardware, which I thought it was."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "roll your best relevant Engineering or Mechanic spec, Nathan."

> (OOC) Nathan rolls 3d6 for 6 (1 4 1) vs. 14, succeeding by 8

> (OOC) FallGM says, "it is a prototype by Starkweather, yes."

> (OOC) Nathan says, "That's vs. Engineer (Arcanotech)."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "Jamie or DeGroot, roll the best of Streetwise, Scrounging, or similar 'acquire stuff sneakily' skills."

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "I don't really have those skills. Closest is 'strategy (counter-insurgency)'"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "we'll be rollin that in a moment for unrelated activity"

> (OOC) Jamie rolls 3d6 for 9 (4 1 4)

> (OOC) Jamie rolls vs for 0 (0)

> (OOC) Jamie rolls 6 for 6 (6)

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "What was that?"

> (OOC) Jamie says, "Oops. ANyway, that's streetwise as default, cause I don't have anythign either."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "I have no idea what you were trying there. 'roll 3d on <skill level>' would give you a comparative output."

> (OOC) FallGM rolls 3d for 16 (6 5 5) vs. 14, failing by 2

> (OOC) FallGM says, "k. Most promising immediate course of action seems to be 'improvise sifter'. Plus you got a squad of Engels aboard!"

> (OOC) Jamie says, "I said vs rather than on."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "more on that in a moment:"

The battleship lifts off, not even bothering to ask Chicago for clearances. As the Starkweather personnel settle into cramped seats on the observation ring of the bridge, they feel the ship shudder slightly. "Damage aft, cap'n," one officer reports crisply. "Return fire?"

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "So sifter hacking it is. c\_c We should get in the air."

"Negative," the captain answers without hesitation. "Best speed north, over the Pole."

Lisa has been given a wheelchair. Just standing up has proven too taxing for her, and the ship's doctor is setting up an intravenous feed. But she - or rather, Armitage's ghost lingering in her mind - insists on talking to Nathan.

And talk she does. What follows is a history of the universe, from its dark beginnings to its believed uttermost end. It is the barest outline, the glimpse of a mere few millennia of human investigation from one infinitesimally small corner of the cosmos. But it is unsettling, and consistent.

It is the knowledge Nathan will need to continue on as the new Armitage, the information that the ghost inherited from his predecessors in the position. It is not the intelligence one would have when fighting an enemy. It is the lore of a very large, very dangerous jungle that a single inhabitant must know to simply survive.

> (OOC) DeGroot suspects SAN loss coming. o\_o

> (OOC) FallGM says, "Nathan, gimme a pose of going off to work on the sifter. Then Fright Check at -12."

The discussion must be paused - the immediate goal of the _Dreadnought_ and her people is still the dig sites, and a sifter is necessary.

Instinctively Nathan senses that, with a delicate and dangerous task at hand, it's vital that he not hear too much about how the world _really_ works, just yet. Instead, he pours his not-inconsiderable mental resources into the task of creating a sifter from scratch.

> (OOC) Nathan says, "Much more"

After the adventure in China, when he'd repurposed a sifter to dig himself and his companions out of deep sand, Nathan probably knows as much about the sifter and its operation as its designers do - more, in some ways. Nevertheless, there was a whole team of them, and only one of him - though a few of the _Dreadnought's_ engineers reduce that burden somewhat. Moreover, they were able to choose the particular model and specs of the A-Pods that formed the core of the sifter's motive force, whereas Nathan must cannibalize parts that were designed to move fighting machines with speed, rather than move earth with precision.

Still, he persists. And the primary problems posed by the nonstandard parts represent alterations to the _software_, which must calculate the strength of the pressor fields differently based on the altered a-pod specs. And here Nathan's experience in China serves him well, since _that_ little redesign of a stock sifter required him to relearn the sifter's software inside and out. The rewrite ends up altering the UI in peculiar ways - it'll be difficult for anyone but Nathan to use the altered sifter. But for the few days that it'll be necessary, that should not be a problem.

> (OOC) Nathan done with that. And now, let's see if I pick up any fun new disfunctions from learning how the universe really works!

> (OOC) Nathan rolls 3d6 for 13 (4 6 3) vs. 2, failing by 11

> (OOC) FallGM says, "and roll 3d6+11"

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Not a good sign."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "it's okay, he might just pass out for 3 days. <\_<"

> (OOC) Nathan rolls 3d6+11 for 25 (2 6 6 11)

> (OOC) Nathan says, "Well shit. that looks bad."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "Phobia: Agoraphobia"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "I will accept suggestions for more interesting outcomes via whispers"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "default assumption is that it's a big scary universe and you need to hide away from it - like on a ship, or even better in a small room."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "also Enemy: the Hounds of Tindalos."

> (OOC) Nathan says, "I think that fits. He's already got a nervousness of caves."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "sold!"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "alright. You guys have a dingus."

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Wait... enemy: what?"

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Does one show up?"

> (OOC) Nathan says, "I don't even know what the Hounds of Tindalos are, OOCly. o.o"

> (OOC) FallGM ^\_^

> (OOC) Jamie pokes GM

> (OOC) FallGM says, "you rang? .\_."

> (OOC) Jamie shrugs. n.n

---

China. The dig site that sent the expedition off course. This time, the _Dreadnought_ sends out its own scouts and probes. And no mercenary with a rocket launcher will easily deal with them.

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Didn't we do here already? c\_c With the Elder Things?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "getting to that."

There's no sign of the Migou, nor of any cultists. Whatever the Children of Hastur were planning, and whatever the OIS may be doing, they haven't invested this site with any of their forces. "We should bury it," states Lisa/Armitage. "We don't need it exposed for this to work, just the data inside."

_Dreadnought_ deploys a few Broadsword-class mecha and a demo team. Carefully the site is covered up again, and the visual landmarks that were previously useful in finding it are systematically erased.

> (OOC) FallGM says, "answer your question?"

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Yes."

Other sites, other locations. Armitage's ghost lays out the clues and the data that he's uncovered. India. Africa. The northern part of the Asian continent, on the Kara Sea. A grid of places. As the team watches them assemble on the holographic globe, the _Dreadnought_'s XO taps out some data on the controls. Fault lines, tectonic plates and other geological data overlay themselves onto the display. "Hell of a thing," he breathes.

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Is there a discernable pattern to this? Like a giant pentagram? Or perhaps they all sit at nexii of geographic features?"

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Upthrust or subduction zones, perhaps?"

> (OOC) Nathan says, "Or even a /lack/ of nearby tectonic features."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "they're anchored more or less at the center of plates. see here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Plates\_tect2\_en.svg"

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "How many? Including the two we've been to."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "Total of 12"

"There's two good reasons to have the sites at such places," says Nathan, looking over the XO's shoulder. "One - they're much less likely to be disrupted by an earthquake or other cataclysm. And two - if you want to pick up the _entire_ planet by its crust, those are the spots you want to hold it by."

> (OOC) Nathan had the thought, figured it merited going into the log

> (OOC) FallGM says, "yep :)"

DeGroot winces involuntarily at Latham's description, Imagining an entire continental plate, peeled off the surface of the earth, like the skin of an orange... it's unreasonably horrible, even with all that's happened recently. "Several of these are also at poles of isolation," he adds, covering his unease. "The literal middle of fucking nowhere."

The XO does a bit more manipulation. The geological data slides off, replaced with strategic projections, troop positions and Migou forces. "This is what I'm worried about," he says frankly.

> (OOC) Nathan says, "Is it just that there's Migou all over the fucking place generally, or are our destinations particularly enemy-occupied?"

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Do they seem to be moving in relation to the dig sites at all?"

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "What Nathan said. c\_c"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "they're covering everything, not this specifically, yeah"

> (OOC) Jamie says, "Does anyone know what the Migou want? I mean, is there any effective bait?"

DeGroot leans toward the hologram, relieved to be dealing with a familiar problem... even one this big. "They're everywhere," he says. "But not covering the dig sites in particular. Lisa..." he hesitates. "Doctor... does it matter where we go next? Or can we just pick any of these?"

"I reviewed our original notes in light of what Singer said," Lisa/Armitage answers. "Originally I'd assumed that there was a specific dig order, something akin to charting a path through the Jewish Sephirot. That's not the case. There's... there's some other significance to it. A coordinate system, I think - each site seems aligned with both a planetary and a celestial location. But to answer your question, it doesn't seem to matter."

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "I want to pick a dig site based on the lowest probability of us encountering overwhelming force, either on the way there, or while loitering there for a period of approximately two hours."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "k. this is where your Strategy roll comes in. goferit"

> (OOC) DeGroot really, really hopes he doesn't blow it.

> (OOC) DeGroot rolls 3d6 for 12 (5 4 3) vs. 13, succeeding by 1

> (OOC) FallGM says, "pose consulting with the XO, gatherin data, and plottin a safety course."

> (OOC) DeGroot does so

"Then... it all depends on staying away from the main force," DeGroot continues. A plan is coming to him. He spends several minutes flicking through sattelite imagery and sensor data, and collars the XO and CAG for an impromptu conference. When it's over they're all back at the main hologram; DeGroot calls up his proposed course, a zig-zagging red line through occupied territories and contested space... avoiding cities and Migou fleets alike. "It's difficult," he says. "But not totally bleak. And it puts us... here."

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Where ARE we ending up, btw?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "what, the last stop? we'll say Africa."

> (OOC) DeGroot poses on...

The end of the trace is in central Africa; in an area that has managed to stay wilderness for the entire span of human history. "No idea what's there... it's a lot further north than anywhere I've lived. But the Migou aren't going there either."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "k cue Jamie"

Most of the people on the _Dreadnought_ know or can guess the current fate of the world. Faces are stony, without much external emotion. Most of the crew goes about it's functions robotically. No real hope remains here, in spite of the enthusiasm that is projecting from the aft section. The airspace from China to the middle of Germany is pretty uneventful, and the sifter is deployed on the wooded countryside. Though routine, the items are retrieved, information cataloged, then buried with any identifying marks wiped out, as like in China.

Over the airspace flying to the desert in Australia, The Migou attack. The ships almost come out of nowhere, and lay some heat into them. The encounter is brief, but the soldiers onboard the ship, having looked death in the eye before, just speed to their destination. The Migou move on, after removing a non insignificant section of the starboard hull of the ship.

> (OOC) Jamie says, "More"

There are a few more encounters with the Migou as the ship moves around on it's task. In all, 7 crew members are dead. They are put aside, in a room designated for that purpose. A few mutters along the crew mention that Smith, Johnson, Cedric, Garret, Mong, Patel and Chen may actually have been the lucky ones. The Sahara appears on the viewscreen, the sandy wastes reflecting the mood of the crew, as the last artifact is approached.

> (OOC) FallGM says, "very good"

Armitage has been busy - both briefing Nathan, and in assembling the available evidence. The strain of keeping the man's mind alive, though, is visible to anyone who looks at Lisa. She's anemic, unable to keep down food, and experiences shortness of breath and other symptoms from time to time.

"I understand now," the ghost announces finally. "It's... a tension system, binding elements of Yog-Sothoth, lesser or subsidiary portions, to parts of the physical planet. The elements of tension connect to, well, the rest of the universe - like tying the planet directly to the constellations of the Zodiac."

"And it needs a pilot." Lisa turns to DeGroot. "You're going to be an astronaut without ever leaving Earth. Because we need to leave, right now."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "from last week, a second Migou hive ship is on its way"

> (OOC) Jamie nods.

DeGroot nods. "I'm game." _And I should probably be terrified. But what the hell. If this is how I get taken out, then so be it._

> (OOC) Nathan says, "So... you haul on the cosmic strings and you pull on the planet. Haul on them out of sequence and you rip bits of the planet off?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "yeah"

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "So what's the control mechanism? The helm?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "it's you. Continuing:"

Lisa passes Nathan a PCPU containing Armitage's assembled notes. "The ritual was encoded across the dig sites. It's now complete. Put DeGroot in a circle, etch some control runes onto his skin, complete the ritual. It's all there." The girl coughs briefly, convulsively. "Gentlemen, I think I've worn out my welcome."

Jamie looks, "That as you have, ours will continue." She says, solemly.

"Farewell, Armitage," Nathan says gravely. "And thank you... for everything."

> (OOC) Nathan says, "Armitage is dead. Long live Armitage. >\_<"

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "That would be you."

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Dubious office. c\_c"

> (OOC) Nathan says, "Yes, I think I'll stay nice and safe inside here with my dhohanoid friends."

> (OOC) FallGM ^\_^ b

> (OOC) DeGroot bleh

"If anyone lives to hear of it," DeGroot says, "we'll make sure they know what you did for them."

Lisa smiles. "See you on the other side," she whispers. And then she passes out.

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Speaking of which. Any chance that I'm going to live through the ritual?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "while the ship's physician tends to her, Nathan, want to pose us through some mystic ritual foo?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "Dreadnought has a sorcerer's circle behind secured bulkheads."

The time has come to attempt the Ritual of Translocation. As the surviving Starkweather sorcerer - and the new Armitage - it falls to Nathan to make the necessary preparations. The _Dreadnought's_ ritual space is well-designed for the purpose - spartan, but immaculately clean, with a marker circle laser-etched into the metal floor with a precision that the eighteenth-century ritualists would have killed for.

DeGroot stalks in behind Latham. "Out of curiosity, is there any chance that this _won't_ kill me?"

> (OOC) DeGroot has reconnected.

> (OOC) FallGM says, "the principal danger of the ritual is psychic, not physical."

"Shush," says Nathan. "I'm working." Not all of the runes are to be etched onto DeGroot - and since ritual markings are as much a matter of the mind of the ritualist as they are the physical pattern, Nathan must draw the markings personally. They are far more complicated than any he has drawn before - and as he draws them, he finds his mind wandering in familiar patterns. Disturbingly familiar - for they resemble the ones he used in Antarctica to translocate himself and his allies to the planet of the Old Ones.

As Nathan takes a breather to work out the cramps in his hands, he says. "The odds of it killing you are remote. Or rather, the odds of it killing your body. The odds of it killing Angelo DeGroot the mind... rather higher, I'm afraid." He gives DeGroot a rictus grin. "Of course, this won't be the first time you and I have gone through something like that."

DeGroot scowls. "I've decided to forgive you for that, since it seems we have to be the men who save the world. Anyway. Who else do we need here?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "just DeGroot"

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Then let's get on with it."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "k. Nathan, lemme know when done"

Nathan picks up the pen again to finish the floor markings. "Just you," he says. "If anyone else is in here when you do the ritual, it'll distort the occult pattern. We do not want that," he adds in deadpan understatement. "You're washed thoroughly? You must be absolutely clean, or this won't work."

> (OOC) Nathan says, "What does 'etch the runes onto DeGroot's skin' mean specifically?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "anything that breaks the skin to any depth to form a pattern. scarification or tattooing are the usual ways ritualists do this"

> (OOC) Nathan says, "I thought so."

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Obviously I'll cooperate. Somewhat self-consciously."

> (OOC) DeGroot poses, I guess

> (OOC) Nathan says, "It'd help to have osme interaction, yes. :) I am working on a pose of my own."

DeGroot goes through the required ablutions - medical-grade decontamination showers make one so clean it's literally painful. Somehow, DeGroot has managed to get through a lifetime of military service without a single tattoo, which simplifies the preparation for the etching of sigils... along with a few painkillers.

Nathan went through the cleaning before he even came in - even though he's not directly handling the ritual, he's used to avoiding anything that might contaminate the ritual space. He directs DeGroot to a nearby table - which resembles the military's idea of an altar - and picks up a tattoo pen. "I believe tradition calls for you to have something to bite down on," he says, producing a bullet from his pocket. "The analgesics will help, but you _do_ need to hold absolutely still for this."

Drawing designs on living flesh is quite different than drawing them on an unyielding floor, especially when it's a good friend. "Just think of the stories you'll be able to tell when anyone sees these," Nathan says, grinning, as he works. "But make sure they're cleared first. Even when we're done, most people won't want to know. I know I don't."

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Great."

> (OOC) Nathan says, "I don't have anything more at the moment."

DeGroot says, "One last question. Where am I taking us?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "if it's just you guys atm, this is Nathan's question to answer :)"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "and nobody's said anything about it yet"

> (OOC) Nathan says, "We should have come up with an answer beforehand, though. What /sort/ of place would he be taking us?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "the habitable band around a main sequence star."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "absolutely anything else is negotiable."

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Am I right in thinking that this is the mother of all d-engines?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "yes"

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Then leave it to me. I'm not the best pilot ever born. But I am the one that was meant for this."

"That's a good question," Nathan says, placing his PCPU on the bench. "We've got a few possibilities, though. All main sequence stars, and solitaries - binary stars are remarkably common in the galaxy. Alpha Centauri is right out, for example - it's a trinary, though the dwarf companion hardly counts. But you're the one who wanted to be an astronaut - I assume you've got a decent astronomy background."

> (OOC) Nathan has nothing more, the rest is for DeGroot.

> (OOC) DeGroot rolls astrogation

> (OOC) DeGroot rolls 3d6 for 12 (3 5 4) vs. 16, succeeding by 4

> (OOC) FallGM says, "k you got somethin"

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Does it have a name? Or should I just make something up?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "you the player can probably think of a good candidate. if not, make somethin up"

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Think I better make it up. The star catalog has like 250,000 entries in it."

DeGroot keeps a few candidates in mind. Tau Ceti might work, but it's only 12 light years away... too close to home. There's a few others DeGroot has heard of; like Gliese-436, once thought to have a planet in the habitable band. For some reason, his attention sticks on 55 Cancri... at fifty light years away, it might be far enough, and it has exoplanets...

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "moar"

> (OOC) FallGM stab DeGroot in the face.

Ultimately, who knows? DeGroot suspects that any hypothesis he has will be invalidated by the experience of the ritual. He selects a nameless G-class star, famous only for being average, and fixes its location in his mind. He memorizes the distances from several steady pulsars. If there's any chance of getting there, that will be his best guide.

> (OOC) Jamie says, "WHy is DeGroot getting facestab?"

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Nathan, please pose the ritual, and I'll pose the... uh... warp."

It is dangerous to speak the words of the ritual aloud unless you are performing it - even relatively short snippets can distort the ylem. Thus, Nathan has left, on the lectern, a grimoire with the pronunciation carefully marked. He did rehearse with DeGroot on the pronunciation of some of the more obscure phonemes, particularly the glottal stops unknown in English, or the guttural rasps unknown in any tongue humans ever concocted for communicating amongst themselves.

DeGroot picks up the spell, steps into the center of the room, and with as much gravitas as he can muster, commences to recite it.

Something about sorcerous syllables lends its _own_ gravitas. Sorcery consists of speaking, not to any human mind, but to the very forces of the cosmos. Humans never evolved to speak to such beings, and the language for communicating with Them inevitably sounds grandiose and alien to human ears. As DeGroot speaks them, he can hear echoes in his mind - not precise echoes, actually. More like _responses_... whispers of Yog-Sothoth whose name DeGroot repeatedly invokes, and of other, still more alien forces.

DeGroot's first repetition produces nothing more than a tip of vertigo at the end. He hangs on, resumes, in what he hopes is the right way. Something more happens on the second repetition... a feeling of falling. By the third reading, DeGroot can't feel the room around him. By the fourth, he can feel something more... something bigger...

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "more, if ok"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "keep it rollin"

> (OOC) Nathan says, "Go ahead. I have more as well."

The biggest thing DeGroot has ever flown is the _Moore_. It's the same feeling, connecting to a D-Engine. After a while, it usually settles down into a steady hum, a feeling in the pit of the pilot's stomach and inner ear. DeGroot waits for the moment to come... but it doesn't. It just keeps building, getting larger and larger, and he recalls somewhat belatedly, that this engine must be literally global in scope. He's only dimly aware of his own fingers and toes, but he can feel the immense inertia of a whole world, a knot in spacetime, tied to his own limbs at twelve different points.

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Fire."

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Nathan?"

And as the ritual continues, DeGroot sees the Earth in his mind from a new perspective - not the familiar globe of continents that he's familiar with, but the Earth as Yog-Sothoth sees it. A miniscule grain of sand on the beach of the cosmos, but with its own peculiar texture - and glowing and resonating with the walpurgis-rhythm granted it by the orbit it was carefully placed in by the Ancients that sought to make it a temple. The very glow that has caused Earth to be a _casus belli_ for forces beyond human comprehension, and beyond anything humans can directly resist. The glow that DeGroot seeks to cleanse from the planet.

> (OOC) FallGM says, "right on."

Those ancient heroes were men of a different order, to be able to stare the cosmic scale in the face, and demand a place in it for mankind. DeGroot feels shabby compared to them, and tiny compared to the cosmic scale he's been thrust before. He can see the light of distant stars and hear a dull, drumming noise that seems to echo between them. It sounds loudly in DeGroot's skull, threatening to drown out his own voice . But he holds on. This is the last chance; this is all that anyone on Earth has left. Millions of people around the world literally can't stand to look at the night sky. Time, he thinks, to find a new sky.

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "SHall I go on?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "yes"

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Bleh. That was badly written. Let me edit."

He recognizes the nearby stars - Alpha Centauri, Tau Ceti, and dozens of dim brown dwarfs in the kuiper belt. Several more distant stars have a rhythm he recognizes - the pulsars he memorized minutes ago. The intersection of lines between them picks out a nameless, modest point of light. If this were a d-engine, to get there, he'd frame a vector in his mind... and in so doing, the Earth begins to move.

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Should I be making any rolls?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "no"

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Does the moon come with us?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "no. nothing not physically anchored to the planet will come. it will feel gravitational attraction as usual"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "surf's up!"

DeGroot's course takes the Earth up, out of the plane of the ecliptic. The cloud of orbital sattelites, derilects, and debris is left behind, orbits bent into a chaotic mess. DeGroot feels a twinge when he remembers that a few thousand people still live in space. But it's already too late. Everything that isn't nailed down - including the Migou hiveship, still three days away - is getting left behind.

And that's only the beginning, feeding just enough juice to the engine to wake it up. Within minutes, the whole planet is moving a hundred thousand miles per hour, four times faster than the long-dead rockets of the 20th century. The Migou can't possibly follow - but they're trying. DeGroot might take some satisfaction in evading them - but he can't even remember his own name. All he is, right now, is the steersman of the machine that's turned his world into a starship.

They're picking up speed. The trip to the world of the Elder Things was an eyeblink, a moment of disorientation between two convenient points in space. This is something else. They're going to be aware of the whole trip and every step in between. The night sky smears towards the horizon, compresses, becomes indistinct, smearing into a rainbow. Tehey've just crossed the light barrier.

> (OOC) DeGroot misfires

And it doesn't stop. Even at this speed, it will take thousands of years to reach their new home. _Faster_, DeGroot thinks. He can hear things now. They've attracted the attention of... something. Things worse than the Migou. The drumming sound, he now knows to be a prayer, of sorts, to Yog-Sothoth, a prayer spoken by the very planets as they inscribe their orbits. The Earth is falling through the sky, outrunning things DeGroot dares not see. He now understand the real challenge of the ritual: not to steer the Earth through this alien space; that's easy. But he must not cross the jaws of the things that already live here.

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "How is that?"

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "We're going long here. c\_c"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "we're almost done."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "gimme one pose to land us. I'll wrap soon."

If one knows how to ask, the primal forces of the Universe will grant you a speed one million times that of light. But it's an offense to fate, a violation of laws of probability and possibility that only make sense under reasonable conditions. One cannot afford to slip for even a moment. DeGroot manages to keep up the balancing act for nearly three hours... then he feels a new rhythm. A place in space, a stable orbit around a new star. A place man might again hide from the hostile things that live in and beyond mortal spacetime. The Earth slows; the starbow expands and becomes discrete stars; the chanting fades.

The _Dreadnought_ is very quiet. But in time Lisa limps out of the infirmary and seeks out Jamie. "You need to change," she says quietly.

Jamie looks at Lisa. "Oh? I wasn't even sure that.... I would still be able too.. after.." Jamie is at a loss for words. But Lisa is usually to be trusted. She nods, and runs to her room. In order to change. Back into the form that brings both hatred and securty...

The Tager mindlink has always been limited to a mile or so - on Earth. Out in this void, though - away from the burning intensity of cosmic power in which the planet rested - it's almost infinite. And Jamie can hear her fellows. _Come to us,_ they say. _We will give you all a home._

_Us? A home? I thought we had already found a home._

_Your planet is still in danger. The Old Ones who still live there. Their servants. You will have to fight. We can help._

Jamie considers for a bit. Of course, they aren't exactly in a position to be choosy. _How do I find you?_

_Link minds with whoever is guiding you._

> (OOC) Jamie says, "Huh?"

> (OOC) Nathan says, "Go find DeGroot and link minds with him. You'll probably need Lisa to make the link."

> (OOC) Nathan says, "As if DeGroot didn't have enough troubles. n.n"

Jamie ponders on this for a second. Of course, the voice must be referring to Lisa. She sends a thought over to Lisa. _I know it's been a hell of a week, Lisa... But I need your help. They want to talk to DeGroot._ Lisa wordlessly complies. And Jamie can feel Lisa's presence.. then a tunnel into DeGroot's mind, so that the Them can talk directly to their pilot, Jamie's mind filled with chatter and bandwidth. Jamie sits on her bed, her midnight black head held in her smoky black tendrils.

> (OOC) FallGM says, "alright. Here we go."

DeGroot feels a new presence. Lisa. Then Jamie - or whatever it is that Jamie is now. They're 'here' - where 'here' is the planet, and its surrounding space. And around them, and beyond them, thousands of minds. Millions of minds.

The Earth spins in place. It moves. Its atmosphere absorbs a few more hours of thermal buffer - enough for its frail inhabitants to survive the transition of deep space.

And DeGroot's vision is now shared by the network of orbital optics being patched into _Dreadnought_'s control board, and displayed to Nathan and the others on deck. Jamie can see it as well - but from another vantage point.

It is a trinary star system. A system of planets lie perfectly aligned around it, each in their own biozone. Many form rosettes with each other, spinning about the stars with mathematical precision despite the varying gravitational forces that each exerts.

And through the link, thousands of sentients welcome their brethren to this sanctuary. The Tager symbiotes are only one of many.

_We are the waypoint in your evolutionary pathway,_ a gestalt voice calls out. _You will become many things. As we did. As we will._

> (OOC) FallGM says, "You guys got anything?"

> (OOC) Jamie is pretty good for now.

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Nothing from me."

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Curious if I come out of this in one piece."

Aboard the _Dreadnought_, a man steps out of thin air in front of Nathan. He looks, in fact, exactly like Nathan himself. "Dr. Armitage," he says, holding out his hand.

Nathan blinks, studying the apparition in noncomprehension. "Um... yes?" he says in confusion - but takes the hand, out of politeness.

The other shakes in return. "The Great Race of Yith are.. my ancestors. In that phase of their evolution, they abducted human beings from all points in time on Earth to study them. It wasn't an alien race examining other species, doctor. It was archaeology. They were studying their own past. And they studied you, in particular."

"Good heavens," Nathan - or is it Dr. Armitage? - replies. "I suppose I can understand, after a fashion. It'd be so much easier to understand the Lascaux paintings if you could interview the painter."

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Shouldn't we all be driven mad with fear?"

"You can. Or rather, I will." The stranger smiles. "In time, you will die, after a lifetime of studying your fellow sentient beings - those that escaped the Great Old Ones, and came to this place. In time you will be resurrected by beings inconceivably in advance of humanity's present state. And you will meet yourself, as I am doing now."

> (OOC) Nathan says, "I'm too confused to be insane at the moment n.n"

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Great. We defend against madness with start thick-headedness."

"So..." Nathan says. "You're... who I'll be after that resurrection, then?"

> (OOC) Nathan says, "That's what humanity does generally in this setting, yes."

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "I'm hip. c\_c"

The other nods. "You're safe now. You're all safe. Tell the world." And with a wave, he's gone.

> (OOC) FallGM says, "k. to sum up: you guys have landed in what amounts to the safest place in the cosmos for non-Great Old Ones."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "final poses at this point, then we're done."

Jamie shifts back, after being the conduit between worlds. She watches her hands pull in front eh smokey black tendrils of death to her slender, orange-tinted peach fingers, used to touch, to caress. SHe ponders, Will she need her other form again. What will become of her. She smiles, and wanders next door, finding her brother, probably in the same predicament. She wraps an arm around his waist, and smiles at him. "Welcome home, Bro."

> (OOC) Jamie is done.

Nathan waits for his companions outside the ritual space. "Don't worry, everyone... we're safe. I told myself so," he mumbles, with a crooked grin. It somehow seems so unbelievable. And then it occurs to him - the part he _really_ has a hard time believing isn't having talked to his future self from uncounted millenia in the future. The thing he's having a hard time believing... is that humanity is safe. After having spent what seems like an eternity in an unwinnable war with the Migou, the Deep Ones, the servants of Nyarlathotep... the idea that humanity is, at long last, safe - it's hard to fathom.

DeGroot walks unsteadily out of the summoning room. He's put on a flight suit and wrapped himself in a heavy emergency blanket. His face looks pale and drawn, his breathing is labored, but he's grinning. "I think we're there. And to think the first hop was the _short_ one." He steadies himself against the wall. "Did they make contact? The ones who led us here? Did we really do it?"

Sixteen figures materialize. They are barely bipedal, and all look exactly alike. Wings, tendrils and other limbs, multiple eyes, and talons or claws adorn some of their manipulators. _It is alright now,_ says a voice in the minds of the bridge crew. And they advance.
