February, 2015. The Seattle office of Persona Corporation. New agent orientation. It's different from the typical employers' pep-talk from other companies. This feels more like a military or police lecture. The paperwork has been processed. an iron-clad non-disclosure agreement has been signed. The pay is right. Half a dozen people now sit in a conference room, with bagels and donuts and coffee, as the man from HR starts the afternoon session.

"I'm here to answer questions you have, ladies and gentleman," he says frankly, as he half-sits, half-leans against the desk, hands clasped together. "You may speak as openly as you feel comfortable doing."

> (OOC) PersonaGM says, "this is your cue, if you have anything"

> (OOC) PersonaGM says, "the story of how you came to be here is yours to reveal to other PCs, or in the log, as backstory."

Deborah 'Chill' Thomas scratches her head. She's been keeping quiet since the HR rep dropped the bombshell about the true nature of the Icons. "I guess I have one question," she says slowly. "If you can't answer it, I'll understand but: The Icons. _Were_ they ever people?"

"The Icons are an ideal. To the public, they are real people and always will be." The HR man shifts against the desk slightly, but holds eye contact. "It is the job of the agents of Persona to uphold that ideal, and we use agents because no real human can. Real people are flawed, stupid, short-sighted and afraid. No offense to you, ladies and gentlemen, but it's the sad truth. Real people with the power the Icons have, frankly, scares the piss outta me."

"Me too," says Chill. Her real question wasn't answered, but she knows better than to press the point - she's done enough government work to know what 'need to know' means.

Other questions arise: "Is there any risk to operating the Icons?" The HR man nods. "There's no risk of permanent physical injury, but if an Icon gets hurt, you'll feel pain," he says. "For some people this is a deal-breaker, but we screen them out ahead of time. The pod technology modulates the sensations the Icons experience, and frankly their biology is such that most injuries simply don't hurt too badly. We expect this will be about as rough on you as amateur football might be."

Other questions, and still others. Chill can see the minds moving behind the faces, the agent candidates thinking through the ramifications of what they've been told. The session ends before everyone's had their chance, and the HR rep finally calls it: "your shift supervisors will be able to answer more questions. There will be a period of orientation for operation, and you'll be able to discover some of the answers yourselves at that time."

The meeting is dismissed, and Chill finds herself at liberty. In the hall, however, she comes face to face with a towering, skinny albino, whose hair and eyes are as solidly white as his skin. He's wearing a lab coat rather than the costume, but she recognizes him immediately from the news: this is Link, one of the old members of the team that preceded the Icons. He stops, staring down. "You had the best question," he says abruptly.

Link is an imposing presence, and would be even if he weren't a Child of Eve, but it isn't in Chill's nature to back down. "Why do you say that?" she asks evenly.

"One person asks that every season," Link answers. His voice has a dreamy, unfocused quality to it. "It's good because you're thinking about it, but it's the wrong question. People are just machines for executing ideas." He pauses, then looks directly at Chill. "You should ask, 'are these good ideas?'"

"Well, for example, I think it's a good idea not to kill, destroy, or otherwise harm people," Chill says. "But if it were that simple, we wouldn't need the Icons to do what they _do_, would we?"

"Yeah..." Link's attention seems to wander. "That's... what happened with the All-Stars."

> (OOC) PersonaGM says, "more"

The American All-Stars were the first 'patriotic' team of superhumans the American government publically associated with. They split, publically due to 'modernizations in law enforcement and governance that made such a team unnecessary', but not everyone believes it was so simple. The Icons replaced them, and have stayed in the country's good graces since then.

Link shrugs it off. "If you're worried about this job, then I think you'll do fine at it. People who think this idea has no problems are the ones who threaten it the most."

Chill nods slowly. "And apart from _that_ question, it's the best idea I can imagine. Who will watch the watchers - the eternal question. And in this case, who's watching _us_ is someone whose only superpower is the ability to pull the plug."

The tall man shrugs a little, staring off into space now. His attention isn't the best. "Knowing about the Icons gives you power over Persona. The legal stuff gives Persona power over you. Mutually assured destruction. But it's all we got."

> (OOC) Mike got nothin more for now.

> (OOC) Geoff arrives from the Paternoster.

"Dr. Link?" The call comes from someone else in the hall, and the albino waves goodbye.

> (OOC) PersonaGM says, "ahoy:) I got back and decided to at least get stuff started. 'viewlog' to catch up with Mike's stuff"

> (OOC) Geoff A slender man with a military bearing, wearing a cap and overlarge sunglasses makes his way out the door, the white cane with red tip tapping in an arc in front of him. It taps Chill on the ankle gently, and he stops. "Excuse me," he says, the sound of a slight Southern accent tinging his voice, and he steps to the left one step. "Still getting used to it."

> (OOC) PersonaGM says, "hang on"

> (OOC) Geoff says, "double ack."

> (OOC) Geoff forgot how to spoof x.x

> (OOC) PersonaGM says, "but:"

> (OOC) Geoff says, "Yes"

> (OOC) PersonaGM says, "would you have any questions for them? if so we'll do that. if not, proceed"

A slender man with a military bearing, wearing a cap and overlarge sunglasses makes his way out the door, the white cane with red tip tapping in an arc in front of him. It taps Chill on the ankle gently, and he stops. "Excuse me," he says, the sound of a slight Southern accent tinging his voice, and he steps to the left one step. "Still getting used to it."

"Quite all right," Chill says, stepping clear of the man. "What did you think of the briefing?"

"Been in some that were more inspirational, but it does give one things to think about, the questions and the answers and the not-answers." He smiles a little. "I'm being impolite. Bodine Matthews, 1st Lieutenant, USMC. Retired," the last word with a combinations smirk-grimace and a touch to the glasses.

"Deborah Thomas," repliles the other. "Pleased to meet you."

> (OOC) PersonaGM has more for you guys once you are done :)

"Going to be interesting to see what happens here. Seems a bit odd that it's all new people. I wonder if there's openings or a previous team going to give us some more orientation." He taps the cane, gently, once. "Good to get some ideas from people that have been on the ground."

"It's usually all new people at the first orientation," replies Chill. "The next stage will be the training, I suppose. As far as I can tell, they're looking for a diversity of skills - and now that we know a little bit more about the Icons, I can guess why."

Bodine nods. "Indeed. Gonna be interesting to get into that."

Chill sighs. "To tell you the truth, I'm still not sure what they see in me. But maybe it'll be more obvious once I get started." She laughs. "Probably best to think of the question as a puzzle to be solved."

Another nod. "Where'd you get recruited from?"

"That's kind of a long story," replies Chill, grinning - for the moment, forgetting that the gesture is lost on Bodine. "At first, I was just hired as an electrician to work on some specialized refrigeration equipment. They didn't tell me what it was for, of course, but I started asking questions, and suddenly they're all 'Do you _really_ want to know?' Well, what kind of question is that?"

> (OOC) Geoff says, "ack"

> (OOC) PersonaGM says, "I'll fix it, continue"

Bodine chuckles. "Sometimes a very dangerous one, depending on who's doing the asking."

"Well, of _course_ I didn't _want_ to know," Chill goes on. "But that doesn't mean I'd stop asking. Just because the answer to a question is unpleasant or disturbing doesn't mean you shouldn't ask. So a few pounds of nondisclosure agreements later... here I am."

"You're either going to be very good at this, or a lot of trouble." He chuckles. "Hell, that's probably half what they look for."

"I think that's what Dr. Link was trying to tell me just now," replies Chill. "And what about you? I mean, some of it's obvious, of course, but what... y'know... happened? And how'd you manage to find Persona?"

> (OOC) Mike fixes that a bit

"Well, after my discharge, they came lookin' for me. Looks like they had use for a blinded sniper."

Chill ponders the implications of this for a moment, nodding to herself. "Well, it's definitely going to be the most _interesting_ job I've ever had, I'll say that much," she finally says. "Probably the weirdest too, and lemme tell you, I've had a few of those."

> (OOC) Mike says, "Anything more?"

> (OOC) Geoff says, "nope."

> (OOC) PersonaGM says, "moving on then!"

The pod room. It's buried underground, in one of the sub-basements of the Persona corporate office in downtown. The refrigeration needs here are tremendous. It's not what every agent expects - no Starship Enterprise bridge, nor gleaming white consoles with futuristic displays. Much of the room is bare metal; the pods look more like U-Stor-It cells filled with liquid and wires than the sleek hibernation tubes of "2001".

A card key, with an agent's name, barcoded information, and photo, unlocks the elevator to and from the pod room. Inside, it's relatively quiet. Half a dozen individuals, wearing skintight wetsuits, float inside tanks and are wired up to the machinery. Four people are outside the pods, working at their desktop computers. There's a bank of televisions filling one wall, and a corkboard pinned to capacity with announcements.

One of the TVs, the only one with the audio up, is showing a news interview. It's between Brawl and Piers Morgan, on CNN. Morgan seems to be trying to get a rise out of the monk-like little man, but Brawl isn't rising to the challenge. "We Icons must defend American values, sir," he's explaining. "Not the values of any particular political party, ideology or religion, but the values which enable these parties, ideologies and religions to function as a harmonious whole..."

"Who put their damn coffee mug on the shift report?" demands one of the men watching the TV, raising a clipboard and waving it around furiously. The two women and one man who make up the rest of the shift meekly hunker down at their PCs, not answering.

> (OOC) PersonaGM says, "You guys come out of the elevator at this point."

> (OOC) PersonaGM says, "This is your first shift - orientation"

> (OOC) Mike says, "OK. What were our instructions? Just to report down here?"

> (OOC) PersonaGM says, "yeah"

Chill pauses beside the entry door to look up at a louvered vent at the ceiling, and nod in satisfaction at a job well done - then folds her arms and watches the proceedings, waiting for a lull in the action to announce her presence.

> (OOC) Mike fixes

Bodine taps in, also waiting for what happens next.

The man with the clipboard - this must be the shift supervisor - mutes the television with a remote from his desk. "You two! Good. Get suited up. We're not wasting any time." He gestures off to one corner of the room, then slowly takes in the implications of the cane and glasses. "Sorry, lieutenant. Off to your left, about 30 feet, you'll find a door to the changing rooms. You'll find wetsuits in there. Get changed, pods 8 and 9 are yours. Once you're loaded, we'll proceed."

> (OOC) PersonaGM pose through

The changing rooms aren't hard to find, nor are the wetsuits. Instructions, in a number of languages as well as Braille, describe the suitup process. Bodine and Chill step out a few minutes later. As they step out, the elevator 'dings' again. But instead of a technician, Bodine hears - and Chill sees - Link, the former superhero. "I'll load 'em," he says calmly, and the supervisor nods.

"Come on, you two." Link guides the way to the empty pods. It's like being dropped through a mailbox slot into the deep end of a swimming pool. From outside the pod, Link's voice is the last thing either Chill or Bodine hear as themselves. "Persona hired you for who you are," he whispers. "Don't try to guess what we expect of you. Just be yourselves." There's a tingling sensation...

---

Both Bodine and Chill find themselves with a new viewpoint. It's sunny - brilliantly so. It's windy - and cold. They are both staring down at a body that is not their own, and it's the same body. Dressed in the armored uniform of the Icons, they can see hands, torso and feet. But whose eyes are they looking through?

> (OOC) PersonaGM says, "reactions welcome here if any"

Bodine looks around, then flashes a brilliant smile as he realizes he's **looking** at things again. He keeps it as he glances around for landmarks.

One thing the pair quickly discover is that they can't _move_. Bodine's attention wanders to the limits of vision he has, but he can't turn left or right to see beyond that. It's a peculiarly detached sensation, like watching yourself move in a dream.

Chill takes stock of her situation in her own way. She can't move - fine. But is that the only limit? Only some of her attention is directed outward, and most of it is _inward_ She can see, hear, and feel - but is there a sixth sense? Some intuitive understanding that comes from the extra-human nature of this Icon's body?

Link's voice comes floating into hearing. There's no sense of presence, that half-conscious awareness of a person standing nearby, and the voice is directionless. He may as well be a ghost. "You're in observer mode. This is Skippy. The team mascot. Don't worry about it.." Link's voice cuts out, and the supervisor's cuts in. "A guy named Federico is running Skippy right now, ladies and gents. You two can talk out loud if you want, and he'll hear you, and you'll hear each other. He's gonna run you through some demonstrations, then turn control over to you. Got it?"

Bodine says, "Understood, sir. Ready when you are."

> (OOC) Geoff says, "That was Bodine. Sorry."

In reaction, the two watch as 'their' hand moves, waving at themselves in greeting. A Spanish-accented voice comes from nowhere as well. "Hola. Today we gonna do some fallin' practice. This is pretty much Skippy's power, so jus' watch and enjoy the ride."

> (OOC) PersonaGM updated it

> (OOC) Mike says, "Today, we're gonna teach muggles how to fly."

The head moves around, and the field of vision with it. It looks like Skippy is at the top of a tall electrical tower, somewhere out in the Midwest if the fields of grain stretching into the distance are any indication.

Abruptly the vision changes. Federico has leaped. Bodine and Chill watch themselves fall, fall, fall, ever so quickly, toward the ground - and hit - and bounce! The ground recedes again, pauses, approaches. They bounce. Again, and again, feeling little more than a slight jolt where the impact should be.

"Skippy's body absorbs and dissipates kinetic force," Federico explains. As the body comes to a stop on its feet, he laughs. "See? Easy. Lieutenant, I'm handin' over control to you. Then to your friend, 'k? Climb back up the tower, then take a dive."

There are definitely unique sensations associated with this experience. This must be what it feels like to use a superpower.

Bodine chuckles at the fall. "I picked a hell of a week to stop drinkin'!" Once it stops and control comes to him, he climbs the tower, and moves to the edge. "Any advice?"

Federico laughs. "Nah. This like muscle memory or a computer program for Skippy, y'know? Like those dogs that that guy train to salivate when he ring a bell? A reflex. Skippy's fine, just jump."

And Bodine does, jumping off and feeling the free-fall again. "Reminds me of parachute training, 'cept you don't have to pull anything!"

> (OOC) PersonaGM says, "now to see if you can land on your feet!"

> (OOC) PersonaGM rolls 3d for 17 (6 5 6) vs. 11, failing by 6

> (OOC) PersonaGM says, "Face-first! feel like posing it?"

Bodine should, perhaps, watch his balance a bit more. Because as he falls he rotates forwards and lands on his face.

.. and bounces! "Haw haw!" laughs Federico. "Better than my first time! I come down groin first on one of the bars. Thought for sure Skippy gonna become a girl that time. But he's immortal."

"Hey, watch it!" snaps Chill. Being a woman in a traditionally male field, she tends to be more than usually sensitive to sexist remarks.

"Federico, watch the color commentary," advises the supervisor's voice, deadpan. Apparently HR policy still holds down here.

Bodine bounces up again, and tries to align himself to drop straight down. "Bit harder than it looks on TV."

Bodine gets the hang of it after a few more bounces, coming down unsteadily but firmly footed - and feeling like Skippy, somehow, 'knew' to apply just enough force without going for another bounce. That sense of detachment sets in again, for control has been transferred to Chill.

"Okay, madam," comes Federico's voice. "If you would please climb to the top of the tower and take a dive, I'd ver' much appreciate it."

"My pleasure," responds Chill without rancor. Though she'd been tempted to get fancy for her first leap, Bodine's experience taught her the value of caution. Just a simple foot-first dive, to get the hang of it.

> (OOC) PersonaGM rolls 3d for 10 (3 6 1) vs. 11, succeeding by 1

It takes a couple bounces, but the experience of seeing it - and feeling it - was definitely worthwhile. "That's good!" calls Federico. "You two got the hang of it." "Good work," comes the supervisor as well, chiming in.

The supervisor continues. "Skippy can move fast. He's good for rescue work. Veteran agents pride themselves on creative use of his powers. He's equivalent to a Stage Three super; the full-time Icons are Stage Four equivalent. Don't underestimate him. He's saved dozens of peoples' lives."

> (OOC) PersonaGM says, "we're gonna wrap up soon. annything else you guys have for now goes here :)"

> (OOC) Mike says, "Not for now."

> (OOC) Geoff says, "nope, not much more here"

The perspective cuts out for a moment, then changes. The dream-like sensation is still present; Chill finds herself looking out the eyes of a woman, seeing a supernally bright scene before her, while Bodine finds himself in the perspective of a man covered head to toe in a glowing field of energy. "You'll be observing passively for the next hour," the shift supervisor explains gruffly. "This is Diver and Fusion, both on patrol in St. Louis for an escaped convict. You'll take no action. Please don't speak to the operating agent unless it's important. Just ask for unload if you feel overwhelmed at any time. After that, go ahead and take a couple hours of break, then we'll come back for more."
