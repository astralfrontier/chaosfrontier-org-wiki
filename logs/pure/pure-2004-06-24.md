The dark of night steals over the walls of the manor of Lady Oenone of Glynthos, the Northern Gate. The nobles of the household have long since retired, and only a few servants are moving about, seeing to the tasks that would disrupt the Lady during more normal hours.

As the muffled footsteps of maids drifts through the library next to the Lady's room, a sudden brightness fills the home, punctuated a few seconds later by the dull roar of thunder. The maid, Cretria, shows no reaction, save a small smile. Thunder before the rain is widely known to bring the best of luck to the pure of heart.

And that small smile is the expression she will wear when she is buried. A piece of the shadows moves away from her still form, drifting from darkness to darkness and snuffing out the candles as it moves. There is no mark left on the body of Cretria, and many will wonder at it in the morning. If any are left to wonder.

The brilliance of lightning floods the rooms of the manor with illumination once more, and the form of the walker is revealed, a form like a man, yet nothing like it at all. It's skin is of grey scale, and it's eyes glittering but lacking any clear emotion. Around its neck dangles a medallion, cunningly carved to hold the shape of two tightly-closed eyes. This same marking is repeated on the back of the creatures hands, its feet, and its forehead.

Before the assassin can leave the room, a maid enters, her face turning almost green at the sight of the walker. Even as it rushes to close the distance, she has slammed the door and is letting out a most piercing shriek, rousing the house as no other alarm could.

Behind the fleeing maid the door shudders and flexes, struck again and again, but withstanding the attacks even though it is unbarred.

In the midst of what is a growing panic, the Lady Oenone awakens, calmly pushing herself to her feet even as the panicked maid rushes into her room. "There are.. there are!" she blurts out, unable to produce any coherent sentence. Oenone frowns and reaches out as if feeling the air. "They are," she says simply. "Quickly now, you must shut every door, but do not use the locks!" The maid pauses, ready to protest, but the Lady continues, "Hurry! Remember, no locks! Every door must be closed, but there must be no locks! Move!"

Oenone looks ready to follow her maid out, but holds back. Behind her, the door to the library, calls her attention to it like a beacon. A door that is locked. She draws out her key, moving towards it swiftly. She jams the metal key into the lock and waits, a wicked smile forming on her lips. "Patience, Oenone," she whispers to herself. "Patience."

The Lady recoils when a grey-scaled arm suddenly shoots through the door, faster than any serpent as it seeks her throat. Ducking swiftly, Oenone turns the key with a growl, unlocking the door even as she spins away.

Even as the Lady turns to see just what happened a terrible cry explodes in the air. The severed arm of the walker twitches feebly in front of her, but the endless scream is what leaves her on her knees, trying desperately to cover her ears as every bit of glass and crystal in the house does not just shatter, but explodes.

The scream drags on an on, and carries so far that other houses light up, people waking to see just what has happened. Finally, after what could not really be more than five eternal seconds, Oenone rises, nearly falling as she pushes herself to her feet and begins making for the other doorway.

Something brings the Lady up short, however. Her fingers just brush the knob for a moment and she can sense the hanging silence in the air. The shouts of her family are gone, the sounds of motion are gone. With fear growing in her eyes, she steps away from the shut door as if it were a lion.

The Lady creeps away from the exit and turns to consider the wall carefully. With practiced ease she reaches out, touching points that no eye can see and then stepping right through the surface of the wall.

In the midst of this blind terror her mind drifts aimlessly, recalling how odd it is that such a place should exist. No manor house that she has ever heard of bears a tower. Even more, a tower that has no proper entrance. Of all those who have ever lived here, she would wager she is the only one ever to come to the pinnacle.

And yet when she reaches that high place, a full hundred feet above the rest of the house, she knows she is not alone. "Oenone, elect of Artemis," a cold voice says. "This running is pointless. It ends now. If you do not fight it will not be so unpleasant. You might even come to like serving me, in time."

The voice is like freezing steel moving up the Lady's spine, and tries to put as much distance between her and the other as she can, a distance he makes no effort to reduce. All around them the storm grows more violent, as if even Zeus were growing restless, his bolts slashing down trees and striking buildings. "I will never serve you," answers the Lady Oenone. "You cannot have me."

The other cannot be seen, but his dark smile can be felt. His voice does not change, as if the earth of an old grave were speaking. "You already are mine, Oenone. You cannot escape. My people below have had their fill of your kin. I can still feel the pain.. it is.. delicious." Slowly the other strides away from the shadows by the wall, making his way purposefully towards Oenone.

The Gods are not idle. Light more penetrating then the glow of every star and the moon and the sun floods the tower suddenly, and every hair on Oenone's arms rises, even the long locks on her head seem to want to climb straight up. When vision returns to her, she sees the tower wall near her has been shorn away. In her mind, a voice as clear as water whispers, "Leap, child! Fly!"

Oenone does not look back. She does not think. She springs from the tower with a cry of exhiliration, her arms flailing at the sky. Suddenly she finds herself in the form of an eagle, rushing away, rushing south and west towards something, someone who can save her.

Dark eyes follow her as the other stands in the rent made in the tower. He raises a clenched fist at the sky, waving it in defiance of the gods even as dozens of bolts lash out at the stone of the tower, bringing it down to crush the house below and carrying the other down to his ruin.

On a hill some miles away a woman with raven hair stands. Her dress is of similar color, and a small smirk is on her lips. "You see, my sister. The gods are not fooled." Beside her is a woman of silver hair, her dress the same shade, and like her sister's, scandalously revealing. "They are aware, but they cannot stop us this time." The laughter of the two sisters is like chimes, the sound fading only when they depart, returning whence they came.

And so no one remains to see the form of the Other rise from the ruins, torn and battered, to slip into the greater shadows once more.
