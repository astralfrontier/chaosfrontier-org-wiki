# Rise of Madness 2006-06-16

Night has fallen over the city, and without the light of the moon, there are only the lights on the streets to hold the darkness at bay. None of this matters, for the one they call the Trickster, the Shadow's Tail, does not use streets. He moves above, on the rooftops of the homes, and along the fences that the greedy have built to keep others from their wealth.

Among these proud and suspicious rich homes is one of the greatest in all of Harborhead, owned by Simeon the Fat. His reputation for being at the perfect place at the ideal time is known all the way to Nexus. His enemies are many, but few are open about it. They have this way of ending up working his fields, or increasing the numbers in his harem. His family lives a comfortable, quiet life of leisure. This night, however, they are far away from home, meeting with representatives of Lookshy. There has never been a great market for the expensive goods of that city in Harborhead before. It seems that Simeon seeks to change that. While the Fat is away, however, the Trickster will play.

And child's play at that. Simeon is protective of his wealth, but even more so of his person, which means the best of his house guard is away with him. Therefore, the men on duty now are _not_ the best of his guard. The Trickster's bottle of oil silences the loose window over the kitchens, and he is as quiet as the wind as he creeps down the hallway. Several times he slips into the shadow of a doorway, or beneath a stair, as the heavy-footed tread of the guards pass by on their clockwork patrol. Never once do their clumsy footsteps catch him off guard, nor is he lacking for shadows to lurk in.

The Fat Man's bedroom is the hardest nut to crack. Here, even now, two guards stand on either side of the door. At least, until a faint rattle is heard from the stairway on the far end of the hall, and one of the guards goes to investigate. The other remains at his post... until another rattle sounds from the other end of the hall. He remains there for a few seconds, in an agony of indecision, until finally deciding to go and check it out. As he passes through the archway, a relieved Tanuki drops down on cat feet behind him and pads his way to the door. It's locked, of course, but a fine collection of bits of bent metal quickly makes this a moot point. By the time the guards return to their post, there is nothing amiss for them to see, for the quarry they would hunt is now behind the door.

And once past that door, Tanuki finds the room very dark. The thick windows let little starlight inside. The room smells of smoke and a variety of perfumes. Simeon's quarters are very large, taking up most of this, the highest floor of his home. Tanuki can see there are halls going from this room, as well. One to the merchant's bed, and another that leads to the other private rooms, where the merchant's children and wife would normally be resting at this hour. All is very quiet tonight.

The one they call the Shadow's Tail makes his way to the large desk that stands opposite the door. The drawers are all locked, and one is even protected with a very simple trap. It is hardly a problem to open the lock without springing the trap, and in a few moments Tanuki has opened the drawer and holds the notes of the Fat. Of course, that is not all he does.

Soon after lighting his dark lantern and flipping through the pages, Tanuki is grinning wryly in rueful admiration. Months of work pilfering receipts, 'borrowing' account books, and sweet-talking some of the cuter servants at Simeon's smaller holdings have paid off, and Simeon's private code springs open as easily as his locks. Tanuki quickly pieces together the details of Simeon's plot to bilk his investors on a large scale. _It's like I always said. Only difference between me and clowns like this is how much we steal,_ he thinks to himself.

But there is more. Under the documents, Tanuki uncovers a small, locked box. Whereas the drawer's lock was of fair making, this one is superbly crafted. Still, the Trickster is said to be able to pick most locks simply by envisioning the lock open. While the truth is not quite that amazing (yet) the reality is still most impressive. The lock is clearly of no local working, and yet this unfamiliar device is opened, and the box opens easily. Inside are pages that are coded not once, but twice. The codes are old, but Simeon's code keys are not too terribly hard to guess. He follows a pattern. What Tanuki reads now is darker, indeed.

The documents detail the murder of a young woman and the taking of her infant daughter some fifteen years past. The description of the murdered woman is vague, but something about it feels so very familiar to Tanuki. It forces the Shadow's Tail to consider what he is reading carefully. He has heard that the Fat has a lovely daughter, but he hides her away greedily, and doesn't let her leave the house, not even under guard.

Tanuki's mind clicks the hints into place. When he was very young, he heard tales of a goddess of the local wood, whose beauty would make flowers bloom and the hardest hearts grow warm. As a child he was beaten for looking for her, rather than putting his time to better uses. For some reason, that memory is more vivid now then it was before. He hadn't thought of that little trip into the woods for years. Now he remembers though. That description of the one who was murdered, and the location of the kill.. his instincts tell him it's too much to just be coincidence.

With these puzzle pieces sliding into place, a mind as busy as Tanuki's might not notice the soft sound of bare feet in the hall from the other family quarters. Tanuki is no normal person, though, and he feels something strange inside himself. Without seeing the one approaching, he can tell they are light of foot. Not a guard, there's no sound of armor. A woman. Only women wear silk night clothes in Harborhead, and he can tell the type of fabric from the sound it makes moving over skin and brushing against itself. She's heading this way. She's moving slowly, though, and he can tell from the sounds, she's bending down, seeking something. She bears no candle.

Woman or no, Tanuki doesn't want to risk being caught here. All it'd take would be for her to raise her voice and draw the guards' curiosity. He quickly stuffs the notes back into their box and shuts the lid, then caps the dark lantern, allowing the night to flood back through the window. He climbs up onto the bed with nary a creak, and waits for her approach, letting his night vision return... for what little it would do on this moonless night.

He has to wait for a while. She's started to move slower yet. She pauses just before the end of the hall and she calls out. Tanuki can barely register what it is she says. Her voice carries a beauty that is impossible for mortal words to describe. It is simply the most gentle, pleasing sound he's heard in his life. "Kitty?" she calls out gently. "Kitty, where have you gone to?" Even the sulkiness in her voice is lovely, and when she at last steps out from the hallway, Tanuki can see her. At least a shade of her. In this dim light, it's hard to make much out at all. He can still hear her easily enough. She's clearly not comfortable, and her breathing comes faster yet when she has to let go of the wall behind her. She stops a few paces out and listens.

"I hear.. something," the girl says quietly. It seems the Shadow's Tail's aren't the only attentive ears, and even though he stays quite still, it seems that there's something else making the noise for him. He feels the rub of a cat's cheek against his ankle punctuated with purring. "Kitty, you musn't be on father's bed. He will be so upset with me if he sees cat hair on his sheets!" The young girl pauses after a step and lets out a deep sigh. "You know daddy has moved all his things! It's not very nice.. If I knock anything down, he will be very cross with me." She is fumbling closer to the bed, and right ahead of her is a small table, and on it, a most breakable vase.

Obviously this girl's night vision - if she can see at all - isn't nearly as good as Tanuki's. He's almost relieved, in a way, because now he has a _reason_ to do something. Slipping one hand under the kitten, he slips quietly off the bed and drifts beside the bedside table. He kneels down in front of the girl, setting the kitten on the floor in front of her, while steadying that oh-so-noisy vase with his other hand. "Here you are, miss," he whispers softly.

The young woman stops at the sound of movement, and then when Tanuki speaks, she reaches out slowly, trying to put her hands on his shoulders, and to feel up to his face. "I don't know who you are," she says quietly. "I can see you are a nice man, though, to help me find kitty. But you aren't one of the guards. You don't sound like them. I'm Meggan."

"I'm Tanuki," he whispers back, smiling slightly. "Pleased to meet you." His mind races, and jumps to a few conclusions - one of which is that the girl's inability to see him owes to more than just the night. "I'm new here," he says, falling into a cover story by habit. "I don't think I heard about you from your father, though." _Though I suspect I've **read** about you recently,_ he adds to himself.

"Oh?" muses Meggan quietly. "Daddy never lets his people come into the quarters when he is away. I'm surprised the guards let you in." She smiles impishly and bends down to collect her cat. The animal doesn't tease her, and lets her scoop him up without protest. She turns her mind to other things quickly, "Do you think you could take me for a walk in the night air? I haven't been allowed to go out for some time. It's so quiet here, with everyone away. I only get to talk to others when it's time for my medicine."

Tanuki had planned to steal some valuable treasures from Simeon the Fat, but _this_... he'd swing for sure if they ever caught him, even if he brought her right back. _What the hell - like that's ever stopped me before,_ he thinks to himself. "Sure," he whispers. Just let me get a few things," he says, slipping back over to the document vault and selecting a few choice sheets of parchment for later review. "Follow me," he continues, returning to her side and taking her hand in his, guiding her carefully around the valuables and breakables to a window, the rails of which get a thorough oiling before he ventures to open."

"This isn't a door," says Meggan. Not that she seems to mind. "What's it like outside?" she asks curiously. "Sometimes I've been by the window when it was open. The wind feels so soft, and things smell so good. Is it like that outside all the time?" The stories of her never leaving the house seem to hold some water, after all. As the window is opened, the light at last reveals her form. She's just ripening into the full beauty of her womanhood, perhaps some 16 years old, and every feature is a delight to the eyes, and her lips curve into a natural smile. Her hair almost shines in the dim starlight and as the wind touches her face she lets out a happy sigh.

"It's just like you say," Tanuki says, his voice almost lost in the breeze any further away than Meggan can hear. "Course, there's a buncha other stuff that goes with it, but if y'ask me, it's all worth it to breathe free. I don't think I could imagine stayin' indoors alla time."

Meggan waits patiently at Tanuki's side, holding her cat carefully and scratching behind its ears. "I can't wait to feel grass between my toes," she whispers. "Can we go now, Tanuki?"

Once again, Tanuki is taken aback. Daring as he's been so far, things are going far faster than he'd anticipated. And why is she acting like taking her away was the plan all along? "G-go? You mean like, away from yer house?" _How do I put this..._ "Won't your dad be upset?" Truth to tell, he _wants_ to take her away from this place. Being cooped up in a few small apartments is, to him, no better than being a slave, even if her cage was far more finely gilded than his had been. But... still...

"Please?" asks Meggan softly. She looks out to the city with unseeing eyes and says, "All my life I've been stuck in here. When I was young, father tells me I started to get sick and get headaches, so he had to get me very expensive medicine. It wasn't long before my eyes started to go dark, and now I can't see a thing." She looks back to Tanuki, "I know he wants to keep me safe, but what could a little walk hurt? Just once?"

Tanuki watches Meggan carefully - it's a little uncanny the way she turns to face him, even though he knows she's looking at where his voice is coming from. Finally, he nods to himself. "All right. Just one thing... what's this medicine you take? Did they ever say what it was called?" This very expensive 'medicine' is starting to sound more and more like some sort of slow poison - something to ensure that Simeon retains a hold on the girl. And if _that's_ true, he can't let it continue. No matter what.

"I don't know what it is called," replies Meggan. "I know father keeps it in his desk, and he has left some with the guards, as well." She gestures back vaguely into the room, "I suppose it would be good to take some with us, in case we are gone and I need to take it. I usually take it in the morning with my breakfast. Father says it is important that I eat first, or it will make me feel sick." With only a little bit of inspection, Tanuki can find the medicine. It's a thick, dark liquid stored in a corked flask in the nearest desk drawer. In the darkness, nothing else can really be discerned.

With that vial safely stowed in a pocket, Tanuki now has everything he could've imagined coming for. And more besides. "All right," he finally says as he rejoins Meggan on the roof. "Now let's see how we can get you out of here..." He doubts a housebound blind girl is going to be able to follow him nearly as agilely along the roofs of Harborhead, so this will take some thinking. Still, there's no doubt in Tanuki's mind that he can do it.

Meggan herself seems quite confident as well. The cat seems the only uncertain member of the party, but with her handling him, kitty stays quiet. "If you need to carry me, that is okay," ventures Meggan. From this level, it'd be very easy for Tanuki to get back out, but it's pretty clear Meggan is hardly going to be leaping across rooftops on her own.

"All right - climb on my back, then," says Tanuki, kneeling down and guiding her hands onto his shoulders. With the girl aboard, the lad is a good deal slower... and clumsier. For once, his luck is not with him - on his very first leap from Simeon's private residence to the servant's quarters, his foot slips on one of the tiles. He just barely manages to catch himself in time, but not before sending a loose tile tumbling down, down... He felt it go, though, and he's back on his feet and halfway across the roof even before the ceramic shatters on the brick path below and draws a call of "Who's there!" from the nearby guards.

Cursing to himself, Tanuki says, "Hang on!" to his passenger, and redoubles his pace. Stealth is no longer a priority - his survival now rests on speed. He's still high up, and the guards can't see who he has with him - or so he deduces when the first arrow whizzes past from ground level. Encumbered as he is, though, the guards have little trouble keeping up with him, and forcing him to change direction several times to avoid being perforated by a hail of arrows.

Tanuki knows full well what the guards are doing - they may not be bright, but they've been taught an effective plan, herding him from one building to another, and the Trickster soon finds himself staring out over an abyss. Even alone, Tanuki would have a hard time making the jump from Simeon's guest quarters to the nearest neighboring house. With Meggan, there's not a chance in hell... _Yes there is!_ he suddenly tells himself. _I can make it!_ He has no idea where the thought comes from, but he trusts it in his very soul, and even as three guards emerge from a hatch on the rooftop ten feet away, Tanuki speeds up... and leaps into space. A leap of faith.

The space is considerable. The guards below stop firing as soon as they see him leap. Nobody can make that jump like that. Nobody. They are still standing stunned when Tanuki bursts out of sight. After a few more turns and jumps, it is oddly apparent that the chase isn't up. On the wind, instead of shouts and cries to halt, something else can be heard.

It begins like the sound of a shrieking wind. It builds to something like a thousand high pitched screams of wrath and hatred. All around the house of Simeon people are roused in fear and grab arms. Rising with the terrible shrieks are the sounds of men crying in agony. Tanuki can't see what is happening back there, but he doesn't need Meggan's whimpering to tell him that it's not good.

Tanuki has no idea what's causing all the commotion back there, but it doesn't sound like anything the Trickster wants to confront. Jumping and leaping from rooftop to rooftop, he spares no time to wonder why; he's merely glad that something is suddenly more important to Simeon's guards and the Watch than himself - nor does he wonder why he's able to return the same way he came, as easily as if Meggan weren't on his back at all.

The distance between the fleeing thief and the home he robbed grows great enough for him to no longer hear the sounds. He cannot see the battle that is taking place. He has reached his part of the city now, and it's not far from the small pitch he'd set aside as the place to lay low and figure things out. This home is not much, to be sure, the deserted upper storey of an abandoned factory. Nobody bothers him, though, since the stairs long ago collapsed, and several blankets were left here. The bottom floor is home to several beggars, but other than them it is quite empty.

Hardly breathing heavily at all, Tanuki sets Meggan down. "All right... It's gonna be hard to find a place around here for you to feel grass under your feet, but I know we c'n manage it. F'r now, though, we need to stop here for a bit. Sorry it ain't much," he says, suddenly abashed. _What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?_ he thinks to himself ruefully.

Meggan raises her arms and lets out a deep sigh. The wind moves through the floor openly, and it streams her hair out. "It's wonderful!" she says clearly. "I can feel everything.. and I can smell.." She wrinkles her nose and laughs suddenly, "I think that's rotten fish, isn't it?" Kitty is allowed to settle on the floor, and the cat immediately starts to inspect its surroundings. The pile of blankets is soon turned into its bed. "I don't need to feel grass just yet, anyway."

Tanuki settles back on his haunches, watching her with a soft sigh of his own. "A'right..." he says, smiling gently. "You... you like it here?" It's good enough for him, he's never really needed fancy beds and all that... but a rich girl like Meggan thinks this is wonderful? _It really is true, then,_ he thinks to himself. _She musta felt just like a slave, back home. And now... she's free. She'll need a lotta help, 'less I can find someone who can give her her eyesight back, but... she's free. And she's gonna **stay** free, if I have anything to say 'bout it._

Meggan looks out over the city, this 'bad' area, as most call it. "The wind feels so good, Tanuki! How could you not like it here?" She turns a warm smile back to him, and her clouded eyes blink slowly. "Can I sleep here tonight? With the wind moving all around me? It's so amazing. I suppose it sounds foolish to you, but I've always wanted to sleep with a window open. This is so much better."

Tanuki bites back a chuckle. The girl surely has no idea how her request would sound if it'd came from the mouths of most of the girls he hangs out with - or more than hangs out with, often enough. And he has no intention of telling her, not tonight. In Tanuki's rough and dirty world, her innocence is a brilliant and precious jewel, far brighter than any he's ever stolen, and he'd sooner chop his own hand off than sully it. "Sure. You'll want the blankets, the breeze can get pretty cold at night..." He looks over, and laughs heartily. "Provided you can convince Kitty to let you have them, that is." Kitty is curled up in a ball, and looks absolutely content. And sound asleep.

"Oh, I'm sure he won't mind. He prefers sleeping on my hair, anyway," replies Meggan. She moves closer to Tanuki, "It has been a very odd night, hasn't it?" She looks over her shoulder, perfectly in the direction of the house she left. "It's much better out here. You know, I've been thinking a little bit." She smiles widely and looks at Tanuki closely, "You aren't a guard. You must not work for my father, either. I think you broke in the house to take something. I don't care, though. Father had too many things, anyway."

Tanuki doesn't bother to deny it. "Pretty much. And yeah... your father had far more things than was good for him. An' he cares even less about who they properly belong to than I do. Only difference is, he does it so's it looks like it's legal." He pulls out a few rustling sheets of parchment. "But it's not, even for someone like him. An' he steals people too. To keep, I mean," he adds hurriedly, anxious to draw a distinction between Simeon's slavemongering and his own 'kidnapping' of Meggan.

"He's not my real father," says Meggan. "I know that." She looks sad for a moment, but it passes very quickly. Or at least she hides it quickly. "Are there stars out tonight, Tanuki?" she asks quietly. "I'd like it if you told me about them."

Tanuki smiles, and looks up. "I'm not a stars kinda guy, but I'll do my best," he says, looking up, and trying to remember what bits of astrology he can. "There's the Swan," he says, pointing at the sky without thinking about it. "There's a story about how there used to be a prince of swans..." The fragments of astrology are skillfully patched together with reams of nonsense concocted on the spot, and after a while, the tired girl nods off, slumped against them. Smiling softly, he gently lays her down on the blankets, and manages to pull another blanket over her without disturbing Kitty. This doesn't leave him any blankets, but that doesn't bother him much. He just sprawls out on the floor, looking up at the sky. Still wondering what the commotion was that bought them their escape... and how he managed to make that jump so easily... he finally drifts off to sleep.
