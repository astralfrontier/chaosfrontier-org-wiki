# Rise of Madness 2006-09-10

Among the many things the city _cannot_ provide is food. There is no water, no oasis, no plant life. Therefore, the three Solars and their two companions must find sustenance. Tanuki may have lived his life in the city, but with his knack for stealth and peerless aim with the sling, he's also a natural hunter. Whenever the airship must travel beyond the city - as it must, several times, as Ami worked on the collar's interface, and now as Meggan learns how to control the vessel - they first drop Tanuki off by an oasis to obtain food and water.

One day, as he climbs into a tree beside the pool, concealing himself amongst the sparse foliage, he becomes aware of eyes on him. He turns... and sees a small, lizard-like creature beside him, staring down at the oasis. Shrugging to himself, he resumes his hunting stance, only to feel once again that he's being stared at. He turns - but the lizard is still staring at the pool. This time, he notices that it's mimicking his stance. Exactly.

Tanuki looks down at the pool again - and then whirls round, catching the creature in mid-glance and staring it in the eye. The two glare at each other for a moment... and then the lizard sticks its tongue out at Tanuki and darts off. It is such a _human_ gesture that Tanuki is overwhelmed by curiosity. Leaping from the spindly branch, he gives chase.

The lizard leads Tanuki up and down the tree several times, its small size allowing it to stick close to the tree while Tanuki goes around. No normal human would stand a chance, but Tanuki is so light on his feet that even going the long way around, he manages to keep pace with the nimble creature. Apparently frustrated, the lizard rushes off into the desert, disappearing around a rock. Tanuki continues, although more cautiously now, wary of being drawn too far away from the oasis.

And his caution is justified, as the slope behind the rock proves to be an almost unnaturally steep sand dune, and as the young cat-burglar lands on the slope, it begins to slide. As he whirls around, the lizard climbs up the rock and looks at him, seemingly in amusement... which turns to shock as Tanuki leaps off the dune from a standing start and lands on the rock, scooping up the lizard in the other hand. "All right, what's the big idea, little guy?" he asks, somewhat annoyed - mostly with himself, for falling for a trick like that.

And Tanuki hears a voice in his head, laughing. _Wow! That's the first time that trick hasn't worked in hundreds of years. You shoulda seen your face! Nice jump, by the way. How'd you do that, anyway?_

Tanuki settles down on the stone. "Who wants ta know?" he asks. The reply comes back quickly. _I am called **Heyoka**, the Trickster. It's my job to keep you silly humans guessing, make you think about what you're doing. I got this oasis back when caravans were coming through from the city all the time. But there haven't been any people come by for **ages**, except one or two at a time. You have any idea how **boring** that is?_

"Yeah, I can imagine," Tanuki says. Even to an uneducated city boy, it's clear that the lizard is some manner of small god... and a kindred spirit. "So they call me Tanuki. I'm just passin' through myself. As to how I made the jump..." He lets the emblem of the Night glimmer upon his brow. "Well, I'm special too."

_Tanuki, eh? Named for my Eastern siblings, I see. Well, seems to me you've earned the name._ As the Exalted Caste Mark flares, the lizard looks impressed. _Well! Ain't seen your like in a long time either. Hey, you think anyone's gonna be rebuilding that city?_

Tanuki shakes his head. "We got a friend of ours wants to try, but it's gonna take even her a long time." He thinks about this. "Well, a little while, anyway. Maybe a couple years or a decade. Maybe less. I dunno."

_Well, are you gonna be coming back here later?_

"Yup. Gonna be visitin' regular to make sure she's all right, see if she needs any help, or if she c'n help me an' my other friends with something," responds Tanuki.

_Well, can I come with you, then?_ says Heyoka. _I need to get out of this oasis for a while! I need some people to play tricks on!_

Tanuki thinks about this. "Well. You gotta promise to go easy on me and my friends, all right? But we'll be headed back to some bigger cities, and you can play all the tricks on _them_ you want. Deal?"

_Deal!_ exclaims the lizard joyfully, offering its paw in handshake.

With the full capabilities of the airship now in Meggan's control, the flight over the vast sands goes much more quickly. The essence wings fan back, and the exalts can watch the endless dunes roll by. The great mountains that form the western boundary of the Dune People's lands force Meggan to climb to truly dizzying heights.

Meggan is at ease in the ship now. Even kitty seems relaxed now, though that strange lizard does draw some considering looks. Past the mountains, the world goes from bright yellows and whites to a riot of green shades as the airship speeds towards An-Teng.

In Ryushi's dream, he faces west toward a sunset. Ocean waves, painted saffron and lavender by the interplay of the sun and the water, break upon the sandy beach and creep toward his feet. On both sides of him, the beach stretches north and south in a gentle arc. Behind him, the sand gives way to a sweet-smelling earth dotted with trees. Beside him, a young woman with long brown hair is looking out at the same sight. Her hair is braided and hangs to her waist, and her eyes reflect the myriad hues of the sun and sea. She turns, smiling, and opens her mouth to speak.

Ryushi sits in the house of the artist Lak, also known as the Dreamer of An-Teng. Ryushi's small pile of jade has been enough to induce the jaded painter to hear his request, and though he scorns the work as prosaic and uninteresting, money is enough enticement to forget about artistic nicety and concentrate on technical detail. For the swordsman wants nothing less than a visual depiction of his dream.

Lak begins the work under Ryushi's guidance. Preliminary sketches are executed; details are discussed; colorful herbs are purchased at market and ground up to make the paint he will use. After several days, Ryushi is invited back to see the finished product. He stares for several moments, then nods his head. "It is magnificent."

Ryushi then speaks to Meggan and Tanuki, suggesting some additions to their vessel: rigging for canoes, so that they can set down well outside a harbor or a beach and approach without alerting too many people. He presents the painting to Tanuki. His plan is to find this place by speaking to the explorers, fishermen, and sailors of the Western isles.

The canoes are rigged, and the group satisfies itself that they will not come off in casual flight - although complicated combat acrobatics can make no similar guarantee. The ship is seaworthy enough to pass for a water-borne craft when in sight of land, though obviously docking it at a harbor will reveal its nature to anyone.

Every ship requires a name. With more mundane vessels, names are given by their creators. For ships such as this, which Meggan comes to understand as having a very distinct spirit of its own, the name is shaped by events, and by itself. This is no mere webbing of wood held together with tar and nails.

The more time spent in the vessel, the more the Solars can feel that it has its own soul. The joy of flight is clear in subtle shifts in the the coloration of the ship. Meggan's tie is the closest to it, naturally, and sometimes she laughs and smiles without any clear reason. When asked, she seems surprised that others can't feel and hear what she does.

"It's the Sun's Messenger," says Meggan. "It tells me funny stories about the people it has carried over the years. Well, shows me them, really."

Ryushi starts in the city of Abalone, capital of the southernmost region of the West proper: the Wavecrest Archipelago. He starts on the docks, mingling with the fishermen and sailors, then works his way through the town over the course of days. He receives name after name of intrepid men who sail the dangerous seas of this wild place. And when he speaks to each of these men, they find him a polite but driven man with fine features and an earnest expression. Though he does not speak fully of his experience, Ryushi the Solar and swordsman is subsumed into Endan the searcher, a man vitally concerned with finding himself among the island chains where dreams, danger, and death are so closely entwined. It is a quixotic quest, but his unrelenting will emerges as he converses with each explorer or sailor. Fool's errand or no, he will see it through.

The search is not a fast one, and every bit of Ryushi's tenacity is required. The first leads are lies meant to mis-lead Ryushi, but the Solar is not fooled. More still, he is able to listen to the mad resources that have been suggested to him and is able to coax from them enough truth that he begins to get information that may be useful.

The Solar is led to a man with a tentacle for a right arm named Foul Arm. Between long rants and wild ravings that seem to be inspired by madness rather than fact, Ryushi is able to learn that to the north of Abalone, and not far south of the terrible Darkmist Isle are many islands that might match his picture. It is simply impossible for Foul Arm to be more specific, and Ryushi is likely to pity the man, who at last drifts off and resumes his muttering and whispering to things that only he can see.

There are a few other sources, and though most try to blow smoke and take coin from Ryushi, one young woman with bright blue hair takes one look at the picture and says, "I've seen 'et before." When pressed, she shakes her head, "Not the island! Are ya daft? I've seen the painting. S'fine work, even if es snaught but a copy. The rel one weren't fer sale, and ya ain't likely to be takin' nothin' out of 'at place. They ain't sah kind ta thiefs on tha Blest Isle."

"You'll forgive me if I have cause to question why you were on the Blessed Isle," Ryushi replies evenly. "Where was it that you saw this?"

"Ah was grown there," comes the drawling answer. "S'not whalefat, either." She looks Ryushi up and down and narrows her eyes. "Ya ain't from there. Ya have the east on yer tongue, and I don't take with that. Why would I tell ya? Ya can't get the real one. Nahway." Her words come in a weird mixture of accents, and it's fairly clear she's been 'touched' by the Wyld, though she seems far more lucid. She leans in and reaches for Ryushi's shoulder with a grip that is strong enough to surprise the Dawn. "Ya wanta know were I was, eh? Ya buy me a drink, then, huh?"

Once she gets a drink, she cradles it to her chest and rocks in her seat. She's restless, and her eyes narrow as she watches Ryushi over the glass as she takes a long drink. "Thar's a skool.. fancy place. I was a slave there. The Heptagram." She leans in as she says this, and her whisper and accent make it hard for her words to even be made out. "Lots of things. Nice things, but ya touch it.. and ya don't get off sah easy." A tremble runs through her at this and her eyes widen and focus on Ryushi's face with mad intensity.

"They do things there," she says. "But that's nah matter. They have a library. Hard to get thar, but nobody sees a slave, eh? Lookin' never urts. So I was lookin', and I saw that picture thar. Was quite a sight." She waves a hand vaguely in front of herself, "I saw et jus twice, mind. See, second time.." And here her face is so close to Ryushi's that he can feel (and smell) her salty breath. "There, under the picture, there was the librarin and a student gettin' rell familir, if ya take my meanin'." She laughs unpleasantly and leans back.

"Thet's how I know at's just a fake, see," says the woman. "I ain't feelin' it. Thar's no power in it. It's just inks, and ya look and thar's just nothing. S'good copy, though. Looks jus like et."

Tanuki grins back at the strange woman. "Heh, wouldn't mind havin a paintin' like that for me own bedroom, eh?" He gives her a wink. "Course, mebbe it'd be too much f'r some people." He leans back and gives the woman an intent look, in the sort of silence that is so unusual in normal conversation that most people will rush to fill it.

She meets Tanuki's gaze evenly, and seems amused by his notions. "'ell, I spose some might like et. See, if you ad it, ya can make people feel like it." She taps on her head and explains, "That weren't made but long ago. They says.." And here she whispers very softly again, "Et's said that _they_ made it. Them mad ones. Bad luck to look fer somethin' in that way."

Tanuki raises an eyebrow. "Bad luck for that librarian and student, I'm sure, if anyone had told on 'em," he agrees.

The priest, sworn to silence by the edge of Ryushi's sword, looks out with terrified eyes over the water as a sudden bubbling answers his fervent, high-pitched prayers. The blood of the Dawn Caste mingles with a surge of foam and parts to reveal a tentacled abomination - Krall, squid-god of the western waters. Its sharp beaks clack together in anticipation and a deep voice seems to boom from the ocean itself: _Speak._

Ryushi answers, his Caste Mark burning brightly on his forehead as the god appears. "Krall! The Solars of legend live again. We seek our former glory and one has aided me in that search, the man called Foul Arm. It is my wish that your children aid him when he fishes." The spirit lashes out with its tentacles in uncertain fury, striking rocks and sending man-high splashes of the tide into the air. But it answers: "It will be as you say." With that, the beast slides its gelatinous bulk under the waves and is gone.

With this business concluded, the three travelers come together aboard _Sun's Messenger_ and confer. "This is my search, not yours," Ryu says. "I will make my own way, but I won't refuse help if you continue to offer it."

"I want to keep looking," says Meggan. "And the Sun's Messenger says since we're a ship now, we should do our jobs. We are supposed to serve the Chosen of the Unconquered Sun, and I will not leave until you don't want us around anymore." She turns to Tanuki, "It's okay, right?" Kitty seems uncaring, and naps in Meggan's lap.

Tanuki grins. "I'm in. I'm havin lots o' fun. An' Heyoka tied that crazy girl's shoelaces together, an' I think he stayed to watch 'er get up too." He shakes his head - he _is_ having the time of his life. Back in Harborhead, he had no idea that he wanted to see the world - in his mortal life, he'd never seriously believed he'd have the chance. "So yeah."

Ryushi nods and smiles. "Well then... It seems that we're going to go find a woman who is both a sailor and sorcerer of the Heptagram. Cynis Megara."

Tanuki's brow does furrow at this. "Right. So ye're sure you c'n keep her from wantin' to burn us at the stake?" He doesn't seem too worried, probably because, by now, he's convinced he can manage to escape in the event that Ryushi and he can't talk her around.

Ryushi lays a hand on his sword-hilt. "She can want all she likes," he replies firmly.
