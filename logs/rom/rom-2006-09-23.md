# Rise of Madness 2006-09-23

While hunting for information that would possibly help direct the exalts, one name has come up again and again. Cynis Megara, a driven young woman of House Cynis who has recently been picking the brains and libraries of everyone with a worthwhile tale. What it is she's looking for nobody knows, but it is clear that she's after something, and something old. There are whispers of Luthe, the sunken city of the First Age, and it's whispered that her fleet of three ships was a fleet of four before she voyaged west.

For all her moving, she's not all that hard to find, should it be desired. Megara is currently making a tour of the southern tip of the isle, often going into homes to investigate whatever old scraps the locals have, and hearing still more bogey stories of great sea monsters to the west. Bogey stories that are whispered to be true.

Ryushi takes the next logical step in his own investigation: he lets it be known that the picture he has, and whose location he seeks, are also to be found in the Heptagram. In his investigations, he emphasizes the potentially mystical nature of this "lost beach", trusting that Cynis Megara's wide nets will snare him.

If anything, Ryushi might be surprised by how fast Megara's contacts connect them. Within a day a letter is delivered to Ryushi. The scroll bears the seal of Cynis, and the writing inside is a flowing but hasty scrawl inviting the recipient to come to the docks of Abalone for a discussion about the odd painting that Ryushi has created and also about its original, which Cynis Megara seems to have seen before.

The ship of Cynis Megara is not very hard to find. It's one of the few that doesn't appear filthy and it is the only one managed by a crew that has most of their teeth. Despite their well-drilled looks, it's fairly clear to Ryushi that these are not fighting men. The weapons they bear seem mostly for show. The Solars are greeted by an old man who guides them to the large cabin. He rambles instructions on proper speech with the lady as he leads them to the door. Before the Solars can quite get there, however, the Lady pushes the door open and shoots a vexed look at her steward. "Come in! Come in! Villus, get us some tea and by the Dragons I hope there is no scraping about!" She is all smiles for Ryushi and Tanuki, however, and gestures with a bit of impatience towards the inside of her cabin.

Ryushi accepts the invitation tactfully, with his usual stern countenance. He does not expect attack, but only in the house of a trusted friend does he leave his swords behind.

Tanuki has, for his part, made some attempt at taming the wild tangle that is his hair; though this does not in any significant way make him look any less like a ruffian, it does succeed in conveying 'ruffian trying his best to be polite'.

Megara makes no point of asking for weapons to be left outside. She only shows a brisk impatience to get to the point as quickly as possible. What she has in mind and what she knows are probably enough to put the Solars on edge. "Right, so I'm Cynis Megara, and one of you has some sort of connection to a magical painting that has a few heathonous names, but is most rightly know as Melek'tal'saran." She looks from Ryushi to Tanuki, trying to figure out which to address. It takes her a few moments to decide to speak to the air between them, rather than ask who is whom. "I have heard you are tugging a copy about with you, but if the locals are even half-wits my guess is right. It's a beach in the west, an old work made in the First Age by the Anathema, who were then known as Solars and various titles based on their castes and ranks."

"Whoever made it doesn't matter to me," says Ryu. "I only need to find the place for myself. If you can assist me with that, I'll make it worth your while."

Cynis Megara smiles calmly and nods. "I can help you find that place if anyone can. But you must do something for me, first." She settles behind a desk and steeples her fingers, her eyes peering over them with a strange glow. "You will help me reach the Sunken City of Luthe. There is an old story there, and I want its telling to continue. I do not know your real names, but when a pair of strangers comes rather abruptly to Abalone seeking an isle that hasn't been seen in hundreds of years, I tend to assume they are more than what they might seem."
