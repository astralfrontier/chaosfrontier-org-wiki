For a full week after the agreement between Cynis Megara and the Solars, the seas are choppy, the wind is high, and sailing is unwise. Finally, after a terrific storm, the skies grow clear and seas calm. Megara is assured by her people that sailing is now safe. She does receive a warning of some unheard of pirate activity to the south and east, and whispers of terrific and terrible powers that threaten the Realm in those waters. Fortunately, it seems to be no threat here.

Ryushi asks for - and expects to receive - as much information as Megara has about Luthe. He speaks guardedly of his own experience in the company of a Scavenger Lord, making it clear that to perform the job they've been given, Tanuki and himself will need to know as much as possible.

"Luthe is a relic of the First Age," begins Megara. "It floated on the sea by great magic." She sighs softly, not really wanting to reveal too much of what she knows, it seems. "We have theories on what we might find in Luthe, but it seems something still defends it. Not the usual traps and tricks that all First Age relics tend to have packed-in, it's worse." She smiles thinly as she expounds on this, "You see, there are beastmen down there, and some kind of creature leads them, as well."

"While we aren't precisely certain what it is that helps them, we have questioned savages and learned its name." Megara sighs softly, "It's called the Great Whale. If stories are to be believed, it is nearly as old as Luthe itself."

Tanuki says nothing about all this, but privately he's somewhat worried... as worried as he ever gets, at least. In his short life as a Solar, he's found himself in rapidly escalating situations, and this one sounds like the biggest yet. One thing does occur to him, though. "How're we gonna get down there?" he asks. The gill cloak, he suspects, would suffice, but he's not sure if he wants Megara to know about that just yet.

"That's easily handled," answers Megara. "I have equipment that will make the water no impediment." She looks from Tanuki back to Ryushi, "A vessel will be ready to take us out to the site as soon as you are ready."

"We will go," Ryushi says. "How will you observe our progress, and aid us if we need?"

"I have my ways," answers Megara. "I will also be sending an assistant with you, in case things get a bit dangerous." She smirks and studies Ryushi intently, "I have this feeling that you won't be needing so much help in that area, will you?"

"We will suffice or die," the swordsman replies curtly. "But I will not stop until I have what I need."

"Yes," says Megara. "Yes, you will." It's obvious that she doesn't care about the loss of these men, but the thought of what might be gained if they succeed is certainly a matter of interest.

---

Megara's interest in the expedition is intense enough for her to actually go along on the ship, which is apparently a rarity. The crew seems rather surprised, at least. Captain Cynus Maragal introduces himself with a slight bow. His motions are effecient, his hand shake brisk and firm, and his face an unreadable mask. Whatever he makes of Megara's new mercenaries is not something he reveals. "It will be a most interesting dive, gentlemen," he comments. "I trust that Megara told you about the previous three attempts. A shame, really."

"They failed, or we would not be here," Ryu answers. "Beastmen?"

"Among other things," replies Maragal. "It wasn't a successful run. We didn't get to hear much about. I went down and neutralized what was left, and brought a few of them out. They weren't so confident out of the water."

The equipment that Megara has prepared for her divers are small shell-shaped medallions, each covered with runes so fine that it's hard to even perceive them. One is given to each of the divers. The party will be a small one, it seems. Only five nervous sailors, the Captain, and the two Solars. Once the medallions take effect, the Solars will find they can swim quickly and move under the water with no more difficulty than moving above the surface. Fortunately, they can also breathe the water.

The sea is vast, incredibly vast, and the surface is thousands of paces down. Fortunately, the medallion makes downward travel quick. Even speaking is possible, though it comes in a whisper. Maragal's instructions are simple, he points down and to the east. He explains calmly, "Last ones went straight down, got surrounded right away."

Tanuki nods, smiling wryly. He's a little unhappy with the borrowed harpoon - he'd be much happier with his throwing knives. He'd generally be happier on dry land, come to that. But the spirit of adventure is rekindled, and he's eager to find out what's down there.

The sea grows dark quickly, but the men have an answer to this, as well. One of the mortals pulls out a strange torch that bursts into brilliance as he moves a small, metal piece towards its front. It looks rather like a lamp, but its light pours out of its end in almost all directions. "It shows us up real good, but being blind isn't smart, either." The Captain sounds tense, though the descent has thus far not been bothered. When the bottom is at last reached, he seems surprised.

"Unless you got a widget that lets us see in th'dark, that there's the next best thing," replies Tanuki cheerfully. He's none too happy about being visible either, but he doesn't have an answer.

Ryushi kicks methodically through the water, saying nothing. It's his role to be prepared for whatever danger lies ahead, to protect the others, and it his pride as a swordsman that's on the line. Still, he allows himself some distraction, as he feels his destiny approaching fathom by fathom.

Maragal moves along the bottom of the sea furtively. There's little to hide behind, and the water seems clear of threats. Finally, the Captain snorts as a jellyfish bursts out in front of him, finding itself scythed to bits by the Captain and two of his men in short order. "This is wasteful. We aren't going to sneak through anything anyhow." His pace becomes a hurried one, and soon the Solars can see that they are making in the right direction, as they begin to pass great mounds of rubble that have become the abode of eels and other fish of the deep.

The ocean becomes darker and darker. In this place, past the farthest reaches of human habitation and below the shallows where men fish, the distant siren song of the Sea - the Wyld made manifest in the West - reaches the ears of the divers. The cold water reaches out to sap strength and suck life, thwarted only by the uncanny sorcery of House Cynis' protege. The dark lurks in every direction, waiting to unleash fear and madness, held back only by the tepid illumination the expedition carries.

Rocky outcroppings emerge from the gloom, then slide away into invisibility. Strange creatures blink their bulbous white eyes as they swim past, living their incomprehensible lives. Finally, Tanuki spies a faint gleam, as of light reflecting from a jewel. He points, and the others follow.

Ripples of the divers' artificial flame slide across a clearly metallic surface. The veil of the ocean draws back as they draw nearer, beholding amongst the roughly-hewn rocks and twisted coral a sign of pattern. Flat planes, cylinders and other geometric shapes reveal themselves to be the outlines of buildings and paths between them. They shine with a beauty unseen since the First Age.

The captain holds up the light, and some order imposes itself. Tanuki, intrigued, kicks upward to get a better vantage of what was, once, a broad courtyard overlooked by an imposing edifice - now nearly overgrown with moss, but the glitter of imperishable First Age glass shines forth, reflected prismatically by the divers' lamp. The gardens have long since been recycled by the Sea, but from the layout of the grounds, they must once have been exquisite.

Long-trained reflexes, fortunately, ensure that no matter how captivated Tanuki is by beauty, he is still alert to danger. Motion beyond the First Age columns looks like a school of fish, headed right for him; illuminated from below, he is all too aware of how much he stands out. He kicks down, and points. "Somethin's comin. Lots of 'em - a dozen, mebbe more."

Captain Maragal, always at or near the front, narrows his eyes, "One broke off." He smiles grimly and holds up his hand, an obscenely large dailkaive of black jade simply appearing there. "Be ready, boys. They aren't inviting us to a dance."

Ryushi's swords slide out of their sheaths as one, and he holds them before him, using his legs to reorient himself.

Like a torrent the attack finally draws near, and the enemies reveal themselves as a hideous mix of man and beast, with webbed, elongated fingers and the fins of a shark. Their mouths are no doubt lined with razor sharp teeth. Each is far larger than a man. If anything, they look more like great white sharks with the torso of a man. They know what they are doing. The bulk of the forces focus on the mortals and the Captain, but two groups of three sweep wide, trying to flank from above and from either side.

Tanuki's chuckle is a brief eddy in the water. Sharkmen look comical to first sight, though he knows full well that those maws of sharp teeth will be deadly close in. All the more reason, then, to keep as many as possible from closing in. He hefts his spear and lets fly, sending the deadly barbed steel winging into the eternal pelagic midnight. The momentum sends him toppling backward, but here the water is an advantage; he somersaults back to an upright position, ready to swerve away from the monsters' charge.

The lead sharkman jerks back as Tanuki's spear finds its mark, and although the wound is not deep, the creature's brief spasm disrupts his comrades, buying Tanuki some precious moments.

Ryushi swims rapidly toward the leader of a triumvirate of sharkmen. His sword flashes in the ocean depths, its blade reflecting the torches the divers carry. He kicks forward to make his attack, eyes aflame with the need to conquer.

Two slashes are enough to open the first sharkman's belly, spilling his blood in a crimson wave through Luthe's waters. Ryushi kicks back off the sudden corpse, avoiding the attacks of the survivors.

Ryushi's off-hand blade swiftly strikes, knocking away the feeble, mortal attacks of the sharkmen. He glares fiercely at both of them, daring either to test themselves against the Chosen.

While the Solars fight, they can catch glimpses of what is happening to their comrades. The good Captain is a true terror with his blade, and has slain one shark and wounded another. Engulfed in enemies as the mortals are, they hold their ground with surprising order. They meet their enemies with an even mix of long spears and short blades, and though one of the men is slain, the first wild attack of the sharkmen is unable to shatter the strong line.

It's still too early for him to pull out his sling. Tanuki kicks off the ocean floor and rushes forward, his slender body rippling like a wave. The breathing artifact helps him cut through the water, but it is his natural physical talent that grants him speed, as he darts like a minnow between the sharkmen as they reorient themselves. He grabs for the haft of the harpoon that protrudes from the lead shark's flank and gives it a mighty tug.

Turning to confront the intruder in their midst, the sharkmen close in. But though the blood of sharks and men run strong in them, that blood is nonetheless mortal, and Tanuki bobs and weaves amongst them as easily as if they were the oafish guardsmen of Harborhead.

His blade lunges forward as Ryushi growls. "Remember your place, creatures!" he whispers to himself, in Old Realm. "Remember your masters' masters." His first cut is a circle, guided by his wrist. His second is a rapid series of slashes, to form the starburst pattern. And his third is a thrust, to plunge his katana into the heart of the sharkman, at the center of the Dawn caste mark.

A gout of blood erupts from the slain sharkman, disguising the caste mark he carved for just a moment. His blade emerges from the back of the creature, its still-beating heart impaled on the end, and Ryushi stares pointedly at the third beast. His message is clear: death has come to Luthe.

For any normal mortal, this would be unbearable, an impossible sight. Only the blood frenzy of the sharkmen holds their ranks. Their battle away from the Solars is faring little better. The Realm's soldiers, drilled and led by their Captain are simply too much. Though another man falls, all the sharkmen are now wounded, and four of them lie dead. Still, they press on, driven mad by the scent of their own blood and the intoxicating blood of mortals. Another dies as it pauses to tear into the flesh of one of the dead soldiers, a long spear's tip punching through its eye.

The attack of the last of the sharkmen that faces Ryushi is agile and graceful, showing the beauty of these beastial predators. Still, that beauty and grace is as the finest of rags when compared to the art of the Dawn Caste, who did not merely perfect combat, but rather took its mastery to a level beyond mortal definition.

Tanuki grins as he flips over on his back and kicks away, giving him a few yards. "Nice try, coppers!" he calls, his mocking voice whispering through the deep sea as he draws the spear back and launches it again. He conserves his strength, knowing that he'll need it to keep their sharp teeth at bay, but the way things are going, he _knows_ he'll win eventually. It's just a matter of time.

Perhaps it's the wounds the creature already suffered, or perhaps it's the closer range, but this time the spear sticks deeper, ripping deeply into the creature's chest muscles.

Once again the sharks charge after Tanuki - and once again, although there are some close calls where their teeth are inches from digging into his flesh, the nimble Trickster squirms away unharmed, laughing all the way.

The swordsman darts forward through the ocean water, sword out. He swings in a full circle, slashing viciously - first to cut the left jugular, then the right, and a final swing to decapitate the beast. The blood of its fellows leaves a vermillion ring in the blue ocean water.

Ryushi kicks off the body of the headless beast, swimming rapidly toward Tanuki, intent on intercepting the attacks of the survivors.

The battle grows more quiet around Maragal and his men. More of the sharkmen are falling, and Maragal has pushed up to fight among them in the open water. He bounces off the failed attacks of one and kicks off to skewer another. Though the mortal soldiers are getting hurt, no more have fallen, and seeing the heroic strength of those around them gives them confidence. They will hold.

Laughing, Tanuki grabs the spear haft and kicks off the shoulder of the wounded shark-man, ripping the spear out. He swims away, leading his attackers in a circle. "Come and get it!" he sings, waving the spear at them mockingly, as the keep pace with him, snapping and snarling at his heels.

The sharks only grow more enraged as the trickster makes fools of them yet again. Their wratch boils, and their barrage of attacks comes wild and fierce as they try to finally shed some of the Solar's blood.

In their anger and blood frenzy, the sharks are getting a little closer in their attacks, and at least once, Tanuki is sure he'd have been a goner if he had still been mortal - he can feel himself almost instinctively drawing on his inner strength to snatch his arm back at the last minute. The rush of power seems to excite him all the more, and he laughs and taunts them in their fruitless assault.

Aware of the scent of blood coming from one side, the sharkmen divert their attention to Ryushi, swimming at high speed toward them. His long blade is red with their comrades' blood, while his short one is the unstoppable barrier which no creature of the sea has yet penetrated.

As Ryushi swims in and takes a chunk out of one of the sharks, Tanuki grins and turns. "Time's up, guys!" he says, smirking as he swerves past their frantic attempts to maul him. This time, he takes a chance and puts some force behind his blow, charging his spear with Essence and letting it fly with the might of the Solars.

Without ground to brace against, Ryushi is forced to use finesse and counter-motion to execute his attacks. His forearm and wrist guide his sword, relying on swift and deadly attacks to vital nerve points or blood vessels rather than the brute hack-and-slash tactics of a pit fighter. He twists about in the water, using the blood of the wounded sharkmen to mask his own body language and avoid telegraphing his attacks, and drawing his opponent into the salty red sea to further draw out the frenzy and confuse its instinct and reason.

Ryushi kicks up in the water, and Tanuki extends his spear as the swordsman kicks with one boot. He knocks it flying back, impaling it. The other two wounded fish-things swim toward him from opposite sides in a flanking attack. Ryushi responds by flashing out both swords as one, driving his paired blades through windpipe and heart. The beastmen snarl their last, rattling and then finally falling limp.

Around Captain Maragal and his men, the last of the beastmen die at last. A sudden thrust of two spears forces the shark to dodge down where two swordsmen move in as one, burying their blades in the shark's gills and twisting them fiercely as they wrench them free again. The sea billows with blood now, and though many of the soldiers are hurt, and only seven yet live, they are confident. Maragal himself is unhurt, protected by his heavy armor and skill both. "Let's get moving," he growls.

The secret city of Luthe has lain undisturbed, but for the fierce guardians which now float dead above it, for uncounted centuries. As the surviving party swims past the buildings, they stop and study whatever attracts the eye for a few moments. Here, a spiraling shell motif made of gold or something very much like it. There, a structural support for a bridge between towers which should not possibly hold the weight. Glass bubbles thin as rice paper which the sea ought to have crushed remain in pristine condition.

Though the sharkmen guarded their treasure well, none of the divers detects anything else. No fish, no seaweed, no kelp, no signs of the strange, deep-water life they witnessed during their earlier descent. The place is eerily deserted, a tomb with no bodies interred.

The city's center (or at least as best as the explorers can figure) is an enormous round citadel with a truly titanic dome above it. The main entrance stands open, and after some inspection the party is as certain as they can be that it is safe to proceed. Inside, it is deafeningly silent, as if the lack of volume over the centuries has somehow echoed into a force that fights any sound that might come here.

Winding, broad stairs meant to handle thousands of feet are still in perfect condition, untroubled by their great fall. Upward and inward the path leads, and Captain Maragal moves with a purpose, pausing only to draw out a small plate which he checks cautiously. Tanuki is able to sneak enough of a peek to see that it is some sort of map.

Whatever House Cynis' curious mystic wants from down here is remote. Dozens of turns are taken and strange doors and halls passed. The wonders of the First Age still exist here, but they do not function. There is no sign of wealth lying about, but no life, either. Onward, onward, with haste and little chance for a breath. "We're getting close," whispers the Captain.

The party at last emerges into a wide concourse. Across from them are two huge stairwells and a wide rail. The platform overlooks a wide opening below, where the Solars' sparks bring to mind gatherings of ages past. This is where the great Julian of Remar'si created a dance that was said to contain the most beautiful motions in the history of Creation. This is where the great alliances of the ancient world would be toasted and renewed in celebration.

Now it is just an emptiness. The ghosts of those wondrous events have even long since lost their forms. The Captain turns not to the stairs nor to look down. To the left is a grand entrance, a pair of huge doors that he pushes inward with little effort. Past row upon row of seats lies a great throne, and lying across it is an enormous trident of some metal that flows and ripples like the water itself.

Normally, Tanuki would remark something along the lines of "We came all this way for a big fork?" Today, though, he decides to express a little more restraint. In a place like this, filled with the spectacles of yesteryear, even a 'big fork' is probably a thing of great value and power.

Captain Maragal narrows his eyes, expecting more than ever a trap. He is not far from wrong. Though what happens next is beyond his expectations. The Solars can feel a strange sense of disgust at first, then a growing revulsion and distaste. The mortals look to each other, clearly sensing it, as well. "'s a mighty shiver in here," whispers one.

In a few moments, the cause of this discomfort is made clear. Through an entrance below a shambling, horrible form emerges. It's humanoid form is so rotted that it is barely recognizable. A trail of filth and green gore floats behind it. It is not alone. In a few moments dozens of rotting corpses start to pour into the room, their lifeless eyes glowing with a cold, revolting hunger. "Zombies!" hisses one of the soldiers.

Ryushi readies his swords, crouching low, face set into the mask of a warrior. "We will not die here," he vows. "You men - stay with Tanuki and myself." If he must reveal himself to Megara's sorcerous eyes, that is a small price to pay if it means avoiding a fate worse than, and beyond, death.

Tanuki raises his spear, his face spreading into a feral grin. "Man, this place is a mess," he remarks. "Time ta clean up."

An imperious voice rings out below, "Who are these people?!" It's owner moves through the crowded zombies like a wedge. Her skin is deathly pale, her eyes a radiant lavender, and her hair of blood red spills in waves. Along her jet black armor the tormented faces of hundreds spiral, their silent shrieks and hands groping out for release fitting far too many tales for there to be any doubt what material that might be. Her icy eyes turn up to glare at the Solars and their allies, "Get away from my throne room, peasants," she hisses. At her side, two men much like her tug out their swords of soulsteel with amused smirks. "Do not fear, Bitter Frost, these men," begins the first. The second's voice comes in as naturally as if they were one, "will not stand in your way long."

Ryushi responds by flinging his swords at the pair of men, who easily skitter out of the way. He reaches out a hand, sweeping it across the air, golden contrails sparkling from his fingers, and shapes a glowing halo in the form of a great blade which hovers before him. As he reaches out for one end, it solidifies into his grand daiklave, and he pulls the materialized weapon into both hands and lowers himself to a fighting stance. "Throne rooms are for kings," he says, his Dawn Caste Mark revealing itself on his brow.
