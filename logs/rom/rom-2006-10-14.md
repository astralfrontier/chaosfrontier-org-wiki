# Rise of Madness 2006-10-14

Confronted by a trio or heavily armed, ghostly apparitions, Captain Maragal considers the situation evenly and has no problem aligning with Solars. In fact, the only ones who seem surprised by what they see are the enemy and the mortal soldiers, who fall back. The Captain breaks the tense silence. "Corpses that don't even have the sense to rot. What a shame. Guess we'll just have to leave smaller pieces." In a rush of essence, the Captain's armor shifts about him, veins of light tracing out ancient patterns of power along the heavy plates of jade.

The time as come to put the cards on the table. Tanuki too reaches into his shirt and pulls out a pouch of pure gold, the divers' light gleaming like sunlight from its surface. He positions his feet on one of the seats beside him, ready to kick off at a moment's notice.

Ryushi summons the power of the Monkey Leap Technique, channeling Essence into his legs and his anima banner to propel him. He levels his sword at the larger man with a soulsteel weapon much like his own, a feral grin on his face offering a silent challenge.

The chilly maiden named Bitter Frost considers her enemy with more far less than respect. She barely thinks they are worthy of her attention at all. She rushes up the stairs, racing past the dawn who gathers his strength towards Captain Maragal and Tanuki. As she moves, essence sings to her, and she turns herself into an even more ideal killing machine.

Before Bitter Frost can reach Tanuki, Captain Maragal moves in her way, his daiklaive leveled evenly, lashing out like the crack of a whip, guided by a burst of essence at his Abyssal foe.

The attack of the Captain rings off the reaper daiklaive of Bitter Frost. Though the blow does not find her flesh, it cuts off her advance, and Maragal plants himself firmly between Tanuki and the enemy. "Be ready for orders," barks the Captain, locking eyes with the hated Abyssal.

The less bulky of the death knights that remain below moves against Ryushi's steady aim with a lash of his weapon, so contemptuous that he directs little effort into his defenses, focusing instead on dealing with the Dawn before him.

Ryushi's deadly blade, Daoyang, is not reserved for the more fitting combatant alone. Its golden edge swings with whiplike speed and the precision of a mantis to intercept the wily weapon Lhar has brought to bear against him. Orichalcum-alloyed steel twists about, reflecting the sneering Abyssal's face and Ryushi's stern features illuminated by the magic of Luthe's lights, and in the ringing impacts of the twin weapons, the Dawn attempts to read his opponent's expertise in weapons.

The light of Luthe is added to, by Ryushi's own Essence. The two attacks provoked a sudden blaze of magical energy which whip around the swordsman and form a bonfire of righteous fury. Daoyang is caught up in the conflagration and shimmers, with white-gold flames rippling over its surface. The Dawn leaps left on feet carried by air and lands on millennium-old marble, swinging his blade around to catch Lhar on his open side.

Three cuts are sufficient to break through the soulsteel armor the Abyssal wears, and Lhar's tainted blood boils itself off Daoyang as it delivers the last blow. Ryushi leaps back, leaving the Deathknight on Death's door.

Tanuki takes advantage of Captain Maragal's diversion, kicking off the benches and soaring out over the concourse. He sees Ryushi beset by two foes, and as Daoyang tears into one of them, the Trickster decides to cause some trouble for the other. Reaching into his ammo pouch, he throws a handful of lead shot into the water ahead of him - and as he soars past the cloud of drifting, falling pebbles, he seems to burst into violet flame, and the sling lashes out, catching them from midair one at a time and sending them at the better-armored opponent, each one gleaming with the purple fire of Tanuki's anima.

Dhar bears the heavenly fire of Tanuki without reaction, the searing of his flesh taken stoicly. The beast of an exalt focuses on the powerful Dawn caste near him first, and with essence charging his attack, lashes out at Ryushi with his monstrous blade.

As the heavily armored Dhar cuts nothing but air with his enormous weapon, Bitter Frost is finally free to begin her attack. She focuses on Captain Maragal, charging her attack to deal with this arrogant troublemaker, her graceful blade stabbing out in a flurry of three attacks.

The Captain's armor is powerful, but it is not invincible. His essence burning away, he focuses his attention on his enemy, and orders, "Ryushi, right flank! Tanuki, attack from above!" He will focus on tearing apart any openings that reveal themselves, and murder gleams in his eyes.

Still struggling from the power of the blow directed against him, Lhar is barely able to stay on his feet. Still, he has his wrath, and a terrible, dark whisper of some wordless, mad language wraps about him, spurring him on even in the face of doom. He strikes madly at Ryushi, thirsting for vengeance.

The battle has become less of a contest in war-lore, and more a matter for Essence-channeling. Against the dark forces arrayed against him, Ryushi draws his own Solar Essence to enhance his combat ability. Daoyang sings as power is infused into the weapon, and the swordsman attains a level of competency unheard of even in legend. A burst of energy, a golden serpent-like contrail of power against a host of black needles, surround and suffuse the two men as they contest for each others' lives.

Tanuki isn't used to listening to orders. He's spent his whole life resisiting the very idea of orders. But good advice... that's something he can live with. And after seeing what Bitter Frost accomplished against an experienced Exalt, dealing with her quickly seems like good advice indeed. In mid-leap, he catches one of the support pillars for the balcony, swinging him around, then kicks off it. As the air rushes around his lithe form, he slips two more shot from his pouch, watching the duel below him carefully, waiting for his chance.

The burst of Essence breaks, leaving Ryushi only slightly blooded from the severely-wounded Abyssal's attack, but this injury can hardly be discerned in the eye-searing column of power that is now his anima banner. He has been a professional soldier for many years; while Tanuki recognizes the necessity of orders out of intelligent combat, the Nexan swordsman has lived as a cog in the machinery of war for half of his life. He acts without hesitation, obeying the Captain's orders and searching Bitter Frost's defense for openings with a keen and practiced eye despite the deadly menace directly on his flank.

Bitter Frost knows that three enemies are about to focus on her. Perhaps it is arrogance, perhaps it is madness, but she just smirks and falls into a ready stance. There is no attack coming from her. She just stands ready, waiting with a smirk to see what these strangers are capable of.

There is no such control from Dhar. The hulking Death Knight directs his wrath against Ryushi, trying to break the concentration of his foe with a powerful swing of his blade, two attacks fuelled by essencein quick succession.

Having spent much of his energy, Ryushi draws on what Essence he still has mastery of to deflect the well-armed Abyssal. And where Essence fails, he draws on the strength of his own heart and his will, compelling his body to move and block.

Knocking aside Dhar's blade by the barest of margins, Ryushi turns his attention to Bitter Frost - perhaps the most dangerous of the three. Daoyang knocks aside Dhar's weapon and he ducks under the man's slower swings. He is nimble, and fast, and deadly. He is the Dawn Caste. His sword will prevail. He swings once - twice - three times, harmonizing his anima and his spirit with the fighting will of the other two men. More than a simple battle formation, it is a harkening back to something which has not been witnessed in the lifetime of gods: the Chosen battling the enemies of Creation together.

And as Ryushi's blade comes in, burning with golden fire, and forcing Bitter Frost to focus upon it, Tanuki sees his chance. His sling becomes a blur in his right hand while he catches a roof beam in his left, swinging up into the air - hanging onto the beam so that his momentum carries him over it and back down again. As he finishes swinging over the beam, he lets go again, a coruscating violet spark plummeting toward Bitter Frost. He grits his teeth, focusing his will on the deadly Abyssal - something about her grates against even his light-hearted nature - and lets the lead shot fly, giving it all he's got.

Bitter Frost shifts with a grace guided by the twisted glory of the Solars. Unlike her two companions, she is of a greater stock, however, and the weapon she bears follows her instincts perfectly. There are no dark whispers to reveal her powers, but blood pours from corrupted caste mark as she traces the perfect flow of every shot from Tanuki's sling.

Though Bitter Frost is the most impressive Abyssal Captain Maragal has seen, he knows that the powers at his side are greater still. Something in him shifts, and the brilliant glow of the Solars turns his eyes to glowing points of fearless might. His attacks are rained down on Bitter Frost, seeking to blast past her defenses or suck her dry of all the dark powers she calls upon.

Bitter Frost moves with all the strength of her dark gods, but the inspiration and power of the Solars is simply too much. Blasting through her armor at last, Captain Maragal sends the Abyssal sprawling on the stairs before him, his eyes looking right past her at the remaining forces. He hisses softly, "You're next."

Seeing his queen fall before him shakes somewhat the confidence of Lhar. He moves back, trying to hide amongst the zombies, or so it seems, until the glow of essence emerges, and the chanting form of Lhar seems the cause of it. It is obvious that he is trying to use sorcery.

With Bitter Frost down, Ryushi takes to the air, leaping backward and kicking off the wall to propel himself into a graceful landing on one of the chandeliers above. He leaps again, throwing Daoyang before him, pressing with both hands and feet off the ceiling and rebounding down to the next chandelier. The sword lands readily in his outstretched hands, putting him almost directly above Lhar.

The collosus that is Dhar charges up the stairs at his enemies. His great speed belies his bulk, and he is able to run up the slender rail as easily men run on firm sand. His attack is aimed at the Captain, guided by a thirst for vengeance rather than careful tactical thought.

The wrath of Dhar, powered by his vile, dead gods rains down upon Captain Maragal like an avalanche and yet the divine who live favor the Dragon Blood and grant him a miracle, so that the blows of Dhar are guided wrong, and strike the most impenetrable sections of Maragal's armor, and he escapes unharmed.

"The Unconquered Sun shines on you, Maragal!" Ryushi shouts from the chandelier - he has turned around, preparing to drop down on the would-be sorcerer in a final assault. "Do not forget this day!"

Maragal has seen many things in his life to inspire men, but he has never faced anything like the menacing tower of screaming steel and dead sinew that stands before him, threatening at any moment to crush him, and yet he is unafraid. He raises his sword and lashes out at the hated Deathknight, and through some strange, distant impulse that has been entwined in the very essence of every Dragon Blood, he cries out in the tongue of the True Realm, "The will of the Unconquered lives in me!!"

The slave of the Deathlords reacts with the precision of an automaton, but even its mighty armor is not enough to utterly evade the attacks of his enemy, and a fresh wound mars his unholy flesh.

Ryushi leaps from the chandelier. There isn't enough room for Daoyang to attack and still bypass the light-ornament, so it simply tears right through it. The screaming sound of the chandelier's destruction blends into the tearing noise of Essence that surrounds Lhar and the battlecry of Ryushi as he drops: "For the Sun!"

The first attack simply slices Lhar in half. His body has only begun to separate into its two parts when Ryushi repeats his attack. The energy from the half-formed spell clamps onto Daoyang and begins to spiral as Ryu spins to make his twin "insult blows", suffusing the man's body with sorcerous Essence. The Dawn leaps away, vaulting over the heads of the zombies. Behind him, Lhar grows unaccountably bright and explodes. A wave of nauseating stench and dismembered flesh coats the room in a zone around the explosive radius; the walls themselves glow visibly as remnants of Luthe's own power attempt to cleanse the filth in their automatic way.

Tanuki caught the edge of the banister as he dropped past Bitter Frost. Now he clambers up into the superstructure of the balcony, finding toeholds and handholds in the First Age ornamentation that would challenge a gecko. Though his anima burns like a torch, the spectacular demise of the Abyssal sorceror, along with the concealment of the balcony itself, is enough of a distraction that, with any luck, Dhar will never know from whence the Trickster will strike - until it's too late.

The glowing explosion of sorcery is enough to make it clear what is going on. Still, Dhar directs his wrath against the nearest foe, wanted above all to kill this hated Dragon Blood who dared smite Bitter Frost.

"Flank attack!" shouts the Captain. He may be hurt, but he is not afraid. The fervor of a zealot burns in his eyes, and he doesn't believe, he _knows_ that he is going to see the sun rise again. "Tanuki, from the back, Ryushi, his left!" The Captain is already stepping back, forcing his enemy to prepare himself for battle on three sides.

Tanuki swings up over the balcony. "You got it, boss!" he says, alighting on the rail and sending two more shot winging into the air toward Dhar, just to keep him off guard. Then he leaps across the hall, catching part of the broken chandelier and swinging across to the upper windows on the far end.

Dhar feels the noose tightening around his neck, but he is still far from dead. Relying on his seemingly boundless vitality and powerful armor, he strikes again, though he is wise enough to preserve essence for defense as he attacks Captain Maragal.

Tanuki alights on the window frame on the far end, jerking his hip to one side to toss another pair of lead pebbles out of his pouch and into the sling. "Right," he says to himself. "That sonofabitch is goin' DOWN." The black-armored giant is a hard target, but he can only look in so many directions at once. He waits for the start of the Captain's first swing, then grits his teeth, and unleashes the fury of the natural Night against the unnatural darkness of the Abyss.

Bounding past the remains of the zombies, Ryushi makes of himself a speeding missile, an arrow fired by the Sun with an orichalcum arrowhead. Determined to defeat this abomination which so revoltingly resembles his own fighting style, the swordsman lands with cat's grace to let Daoyang deliver its deadly blow. _I will not be the monster if I defeat him._

As blows rain from all sides, it is hard to be sure which attack lays the foe low first. As Ryushi's tremendous blasts lurch the Deathknight off his feet, the Captain's blade is scything out at a sudden opening, a seam where the plate armor cannot protect the flesh. For a moment, jade and orichalcum meet inside the black heart of Dhar, and then as one both weapons are twisted and then drawn out in a spray of unliving blood. With a thunderous crash Dhar falls forward.

Ryushi wipes the sweat from his brow, still aflame with Essence, and turns to regard the rest of the room.

What follows is strange, perhaps, but in the face of so many wonders, even the sudden appearance of squads of sharkmen can hardly be too shocking. The sounds of battle ring out from many directions, but it grows distant quickly. For whatever reason, the beastmen ignore the exalts and their mortal soldiers, focusing completely on the forces of the undead, not even sparing a glance for those who destroyed the enemy generals.

If the beastmen will ignore the Solars, Ryushi will return the favor. He turns his attention to Bitter Frost, mindful that she is only unconscious, and quickly begins divesting her of arms, armor, or other advantages she might employ when awake.

The Captain frowns at the beastmen, but seems to think Ryushi has a wise idea. He focuses on Dhar, leaving the abyssal's corpse unarmored and free of any useful equipment. "I think that finding the Hall of Tomes might be a bit foolish," says Maragal. "It's not far, but I can't make heads or tails of what is going on here. Seems like some kind of war between the dead and the savages is breaking out on top of us."

Tanuki makes his way around to the balcony. "Man," he says, "Those guys were somethin' else." The silent bonfire around him hides his expression, but he sounds impressed. He looks down at the battle below. "Someone told 'em what they oughta be fightin. I'm thinkin whoever gave the orders oughta be out there somewhere."

Ryushi spends a moment to unsocket a Hearthstone from Bitter Frost's blade. He slips his Hearthstone Compass out of a pocket, sockets the stone, and returns it to its hiding place. "Let's wait a moment," he agrees.

Captain Maragal has his men handle the cursed gear of Dhar, then moves down the stairs to collect the weapon of Lhar. The armor appears to have been destroyed by the force of the spell or the blow that slew the Deathknight. "One less thing to worry about, there," mutters the Dragon Blood. Still, there is no message sent, and now the halls are silent again. It is as if the beastmen really couldn't see the exalts or their allies.

Ryushi hums. He's fully aware of how brilliantly-lit the Exalts are; there must be something else at work. "Let's go," he suggests.

"Seems wise enough. Megara can get her books elsewhere," says Maragal. He focuses his mind, and doesn't even wonder how easily he slips from leader to follower. It isn't a matter of feeling right. It is right. "I only know two ways out. The way we followed in was the fastest way to this point that I know of. The other way might be a bit more out of the way.. not sure which is wisest to follow."

"The beastmen are not necessarily our allies; the Deathknights are clearly our enemies," muses Ryu aloud. "We're in danger either way. I vote for speed."

"Then we'll use the path we followed to get here," says Maragal. His pace is greater, this time. Not even a moment's glance is directed at the great weapon on the throne. He races in the lead, skidding to a halt whenever he hears fighting, then rushing on when it grows quiet. By luck or skill, soon the exalts are at the edge of Luthe, and must ready themselves with their wonders of underwater survival.

The trip to the surface is surprisingly free of incident. Still, there is one spectacular vision afforded the exalts as they look back. Luthe is surrounded to the north by battle, flares of light revealing the use of essence as two dark forces collide. "Good thing we didn't try to exit on that side," he murmurs.

When presented with the evidence and news, Megara is suprisingly untroubled. Well, at least not until she hears that nothing was gained from below. "Not the least thing," she murmurs thoughtfully. She stares off into space for a moment, and then says, "We should be away. If Luthe is a place of war, it is not likely we will gain much here. There must be other places of the lost age that we might find.."

Ryushi frowns. "I will not delay my search for years," he says. "If what you seek is in Luthe, then I have an idea on how to return there."

Ryushi's words go unanswered at first. "Well, they have done as they promised, and so we ought to help them," says Maragal. This rouses Megara from whatever world she was in and she nods. "Of course. Even a promise to the 'anathema' must be honored." The way she uses that word speaks volumes. She mocks the term.

Ryushi nods. "Call the gods of the sea," he suggests. "Learn who leads the tribes. Tanuki and I will carry our spoils down as proof of the death of the Deathknights. If they will treat with us, you may get what you want. If they will not... well, it relieves you of an inconvenient obligation."

"I will take that under consideration," says Megara. "But Maragal is right, and finding this shore of dreams might be interesting." Captain Maragal gives Ryushi a look that makes it clear. This abrupt shifting of direction is hardly uncommon. "We will resolve that riddle first, then confront this other puzzle."
