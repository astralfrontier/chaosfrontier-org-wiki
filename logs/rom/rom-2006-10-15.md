# Rise of Madness 2006-10-15

Luthe is further West than the conservative men of the Archipelago comfortably venture. These are pirate waters, the domain of strange spirits and gods, and uncanny for sailing. The Lintha are known to ply these waters and rumored to go beyond them - or beneath them - further than is right for even the scum of the waves.

In the stories that are told on the islands of the illimitable Outer Sea, "and they sailed into the west" is not a happy ending. It is an ending poignant with loss and gravid with unspoken horror. The Sea waits some distance beyond the regular trade lanes, eager to grant the desires of those foolish enough to enter its clutches.

These menaces to sanity are detailed in some of the books ("the safer ones") that Cynis Megara grudgingly permitted Ryushi access to. He sits nestled against the railing to the stern of Megara's vessel, sternly thumbing through a tattered volume in hope of finding some clue to the beach of his dreams.

Gradually he becomes aware of something. He has been idly toying with a quill, and a vial of squid's ink sits beside him. Now he recognizes some of the sidenotes, margins and footnotes as his own handwriting. The ink is still drying; he has been adding notes, correcting details or adding to the narrative in places.

He blows carefully on the pages to preserve the new notations, mindful of the decrepit books' conditions. They are from the Shogunate, written when the Dynasty was in power. This book contains several manuscripts bound together to form a semi-coherent narrative of Western life in past ages, and to guide the sailor through the charted or uncharted dangers of the ocean. Now he realizes something else.

Several of the manuscripts are in Old Realm, transcribed it seems from even earlier sources. Perhaps some of these date to earlier than the Shogunate itself, a time the Dragon-Blooded speak of in only the vaguest terms. With a start, Ryushi comes to know why he wasn't aware of his own note-taking. The quill falls from his fingers.

The notes he's been adding are in the same hand as some of the oldest transcriptions. The handwriting is the same. In his focus as a scholar, he has been writing in the same hand as that of the original author, a man who must now must be millennia dead.

Ryu thumbs quickly through the book, looking for any hint of biographical data; finding none, he resigns himself to regarding this as a simple mystery. The Dragon-Blooded, he reflects, would have carefully censored any reference to the works of the "Anathema". The text itself was useful enough to retain, while its author would have been a political and religious embarrassment.

The book has inspired any number of thoughts in the Solar swordsman, and he takes time to meditate on what he's read as he performs his daily regimen. Megara's sailing expedition is trading for supplies at a small island off the main routes, and Ryushi has found himself a table-flat rock several yards off shore, out of sight of the tiny settlement that dwells there. Rather than resigning himself to his normal practice, he decides to begin a new kata. With Daoyang in hand (and mindful that there are no observers), he begins spinning the masive golden blade in a series of arcs and twisting it through the air, maximizing his attunement to the wonder-weapon.

Imagined attacks are met by block after block; imagined openings are dealt a swift and flawless punishment by his counterattacks. The sword flows smoothly, obeying his every wish, and the swordsman feels quite pleased with himself for having devised an effective workout on such short notice. He dismisses Daoyang to its unseen sheath and turns, only to be confronted by a sight from the water.

While no villagers or sailors have seen him, he was indeed observed, by a merwoman. The silky blue skin and alluring eyes of the elemental are attractive enough, but what draws Ryushi's attention are her words. "Welcome back, swordsman."

"What do you mean?" Ryushi asks. "This is my first time in the West."

"It is not. For the Chosen bearing that very blade triumphed over the sea-serpent Karkah in this very place, using those very moves. None of us knew how it happened, but Karkah's reign over us ceased within moments. He arrived from the air, then vaulted into the sky again when it was done."

Ryushi frowns. "Do you know anything..." The mermaid shakes her head quickly. "We petitioned the sea and sky gods for help. They must have sent word to the Deliberative. Their champion came, and he left. That is all we know. But we give thanks by remembering the deed, always."

Ryushi is silent. He bows low to the creature, who slips under the waves and swims rapidly away. _I struck away every blow effortlessly. I thought only to go easy on myself, but if that was a real opponent's attacks.... Then I have learned something new. Or remembered something._ Still musing, he moves to return to Megara's vessel.
