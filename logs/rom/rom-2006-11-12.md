# Rise of Madness 2006-11-12

The candlelight in Megara's study is dim and the shadows long. In front of her sit the two Solars, as well as Captain Maragal. A blood-stained book lies open before Megara and three pages of a letter are set beside it. Each page appears to have survived a blasting of fire, and along the edges of the third page, consuming a most critical portion of text, an eerie glow serves as a hint of what might have destroyed it. Megara has said nothing, but the tension in the room is deafening.

"This letter arrived less then an hour ago," begins Megara. "The book ten minutes later." She taps on her desk in a steady, slow rhythm. A dirge. "It comes from a distant cousin in Pangu, on the isle that some once called Blessed." Each word comes slowly. Megara rarely has to think so carefully when she speaks. "It was delivered to me by Cryaz, one of the demons in his service. This demon is bound to not lie, nor fail in its master." She turns back to the letter. "The cypher is unmistakable, and the words are clear. Less than five hours ago Cynis Belar, Cynis Falen, and Cynis Wesel were all killed. It is a dire day for House Cynis." Her smirk leaves no room for pity.

Ryushi says nothing. He will not mourn the deaths of the notorious House Cynis, who seem cursed with moral weakness - including, to some extent, Megara herself in her own peculiar way. But he will not speak of this to a woman who has lost family, whatever she herself may have thought of them.

Tanuki has slowly been learning some manners, although to some extent they are still a thin veneer over casual insolence. In a tavern, he'd be tipping his chair back with his feet on the table by now; here, he merely leans back with his arms crossed. "Think whatever-it-was might be comin' for you next?" he asks.

"Oh no," replies Megara. "You see, the loss of Cynis' daughters is rather convenient. Their private records were burned. Nobody knows where Cynis Megara is except for agents that none will suspect." She turns back to the letter, "No, the important part is lost to us. The important part is what we must know." She raises the third page and reads, "The assassinations were clearly carried out by conspiracy. The three targets were slain at precisely the same time, all with the same kind of weapons, made of a most rare material." Cynis Megara sighs, "And here is when I begin to lose what is most important. 'The weapons were made of'.. it is distorted. Clearly an odd material rarely seen. It goes on below to mention, 'sure if message will reach you, bindings weakening..' And yet more of this strange green, and finally, 'down Blorgr due to failings, have to try...' There's something serious going wrong, but I have puzzled out part of this mystery."

With most grim satisfaction, Megara explains, "Cryaz cannot lie. I know how this creature was bound. I asked it if it could lie. It said no. I believed it was not being entirely forthright, so I decided to give it an incentive. Under extreme duress, it switched answers to several questions. This should be impossible." She frowns as she goes on, "Unfortunately, in my haste, I destroyed Cryaz before I could learn more from it."

Ryushi shifts in his seat. "I will not involve myself in the machinations of your family. But I will protect you while you lead us to the goal I seek," he says at last.

Tanuki leans forward, rubbing his stubbled chin. "Hmp. So yon message got erased right when it woulda given you a clue about who did this thing? Sounds fishy ta me. Least it got erased rather'n altered - tho maybe that's harder ta do." Whether it's any of his business or not, a mysterious assassination has his curiosity.

"I believe that Cryaz damaged part of the letter and even was able to lose pages of it," replies Megara. She shakes her head, turning those distant, emotionless eyes to Ryushi, "You seem to think that the killing of the heads of a Great House is no different than slaying a few threshold worthies. I believe that there was a response. More killing. When we go to the Heptagram to take what you desire, we will be entering a war. More interesting still is that the pacts that bind demons are not working properly. A most interesting development, don't you agree?"

"War is nothing new to me," the swordsman answers. "And I have slain demons. If they assault their summoners as often as they assault us, I consider that to our advantage. Interesting, yes, but not more dangerous than the massed might of the Heptagram's sorcerers directed at us."

Tanuki says nothing, but his reaction is similarly indifferent. Perhaps if he had more occult training, this would worry him more - but as someone who had never even seen a demon until after he Exalted, demon lore is a closed book to him.

"The real question is whether it is the right time for this, and who selected this time," murmurs Megara. "The Realm's war is balanced. It will send all of Creation into chaos, I fear." She frowns at the letter, then turns her attention to the book. "Now this, though damaged, is comprehensible, if rather bizarre. I do not know why my contact would have it, nor how, but sending it hastily away makes a great deal of sense." She lifts the tome and shows the spine to Ryushi and then to Tanuki, "This was stolen from the Imperial Library. The seal is.. well, it doesn't matter. This book is heresy." She smirks at this, "Well, heresy to the idiots, anyway. I've learned the truth of the matter. It is a story of the Old Realm. I haven't read it all but one thing is clear: it isn't for me." She seems annoyed. "It was sent with a small note and given to and I quote: The Solars Ryushi and Tanuki, who are assisting Cynis Megara."

Ryushi blinks at this news. "Then a sorcerer has spied on you, or you have a traitor," he replies. He does not speak of the other possibility - Meggan knows of the arrangement, and perhaps Ami does by now. "What story does it tell?" he asks instead.

Tanuki sits up straight, all signs of his slouch vanishing in an instant. This got personal in a hell of a hurry. "_This_ smells like a hot day at th'fish market. Word's gettin round." And on reflection, _this_ word is one Megara does not want spreading any more than he does.

"I don't know how they might spy on us that way," replies Megara. "I have taken precautions, but it is obviously possible. I have already made arrangements to become harder to find. It will not be easy, but with your help we are going to leave here in the next hour and never return." She looks around the room slowly and then shuts her eyes. "I have not read much of the book yet. I only read what I did to ensure that it was not a trap of some kind. It does not belong to me." She holds out the book, "It is written in Old Realm, but I suspect you may know this language. If not, I can translate it for you. Do not let anyone not in this room see the book unless you trust them with our lives. If you are impatient, I can read through the volume and give you a summary later. It is not a light read, judging from the excerpts I read."

Ryushi leans forward, extending an open hand. "I will translate for Tanuki," he says.

Tanuki smirks a little, but nods appreciatively to Ryushi. Even in Flametongue, reading without his lips moving is a skill Tanuki has never seen fit to develop.

The book is passed to Ryushi without argument. "I have set aside enough wealth to maintain us quite well, but Maragal and I need to leave this place without our ships. I will prepare orders so that they might go the Threshold and serve me there. It should at least keep them from getting caught in the war for a few weeks." Megara sighs softly, "Unfortunately, this leaves us in something of a troubled situation. We must help you as we promised, but we would be mad to try the plan I had devised."

"Then we must make a new plan." Ryushi presses forward. "Or we must search the West. If the painting will tell me something new, we should get it. But I'm content to find the place itself."

"I don't think we have enough information to make much of a search without the painting," replies Megara. "At least I am sure I do not. I think the painting is important, and that it is worth the risk." She folds her hands and glares down at the letter. "I am also afraid that if we do not go there in haste, what we desire may be destroyed." As she speaks, it seems Megara's tone is changing, something in her shifting about. "My suggestion is that we use the cover of war to take what we need from the Heptagram. Whatever is there will just be used to kill anyway."

"Now that's my kind of plan," grins Ryushi.

"There will be no turning back," says Maragal. He looks at Megara closely and asks, "Why are you going to throw away your future and let yourself be so directly involved? Have you grown so bored of reading these distant stories?"

Megara laughs quietly at this and turns her strange, bright eyes to Ryushi, and then to Tanuki. "I am doing this because I know what happened. I am not casting away some precious future. I am embracing it." Finally she meets Maragal's eyes, "It is one thing to read an old story, it is quite a more exciting proposition to write the tale of the Dawning of a New Age."

Megara goes on after a bit of time to gather her wits. She's obviously better at dealing with books than people. "You must have a ship of some kind. You came on this island and I was able to find no proof of either of you as passengers on any of the vessels. Either you had pirate help, which is certainly possible, or my suspicions are right."

Tanuki grins wryly. "Damn. Knew I forgot somethin'. We shoulda bribed a portmaster when we came in, Ryu." He turns to his fellow Solar, raising an eyebrow and giving an almost imperceptible nod.

The swordsman nods in return, and rises to his feet.

Outside, the two Solars walk across the deck. They ascend the rigging of the ship, leaping with the grace of the crane and the agility of the monkey. And as one, their anima banners flare to full visibility - the signal Meggan should expect to see if the Solars need open assistance. The brave light of the Dawn mingles with the shadow-casting light of the Night.

Nothing happens at first. Then, a glimmer appears in the sky - and then, almost faster than thought, the gleam grows, spreads, becomes the light of the Solars' anima banners reflecting off the wings of a great bird. With a silent rush of Essence, the First Age airship swoops down upon Megara's vessel, Solar light glimmering along its flanks, its tail angled downward and crackling with lightning... and only as it approaches closer, close enough to see Ryushi and Tanuki waving cheerfully, clearly not under immediate threat, does the tail coil back and the lightnings die away.

In time, Ryushi and Tanuki are aboard the _Sun's Messenger_. While Ryushi watches the deck of Megara's ship tensely, the Trickster explains to his young friend the situation. Ultimately, bringing the Realm's people aboard may present a risk, and Meggan must understand them.

"They had plenty o' chances to go fer us, once they knew what we were," Tanuki is saying. "Megara's an odd duck, an' she makes me nervous sometimes, but then I think Ryu an' I make her a bit nervous too," he adds, grinning. "So we wanna bring her along for this next bit..." He pauses. "I mean, it's prob'ly gonna be dangerous, mebbe more dangerous 'n the other things we done already. Megara seems really worried about what's goin on, an' I don't think she scares easy."

Meggan tilts her head, stroking Kitty on her lap. "Ryushi hears a voice he must follow, and it speaks to him through that painting. If it's that important that you want to help him, I want to help too." Kitty mews softly, as if in agreement - although in all probability it's just content to have its mistress petting it.

Megara is quite eager to ride this ship now that she's seen it. She's also happy to get her most critical resources on board. These would be a box full of diaries, a few precious books, and Maragal's more practical supplies for survival. The Captain is certainly impressed, though he does his best not to be too obvious about it. Still, he's always running his fingers along the surfaces of the ship and murmuring 'fine bit of work here' or 'beautiful lines' under his breath.

The trip to the Blessed Isle is guided largely by Maragal. The man knows so much about the defenses that one has to conclude that he has made a regular exercise of their defeat. "Undersea is naturally expected," he says quietly, "But there are some areas where a ship like this can move without any hope of detection." The captain even shows a rare rush of emotion, "A fine vessel! With ten of these I could make the navy look like complete fools!"

"We'll have to settle for doing so with one," Ryushi replies with a faint smile.

Megara arches an eyebrow at this, but she can hardly claim any moral highground. "The Heptagram is a great seat of power, which only a fool would contemplate attacking or looting," she explains. "Of course, that belief is exactly why we are going to succeed." Maragal looks over at her and says drily, "That and the assistance of the most frequently disciplined student in its history. How many times were you nearly thrown out?"

Tanuki grins roguishly at that - an expression that comes naturally to him. "Sounds like we're experts on being fools here, then," he remarks.

"Twenty six times I was nearly thrown out," replies Megara evenly. She sounds rather proud of it. "After that, I had already read all I needed." She looks to Ryushi and Tanuki, "I will get us past the sorcerous barriers. Even with the best of care, it is likely we'll have to get past a few obstacles that fall more in your department." She shrugs it off, "I have a feeling that my two 'anathema' allies will be able to deal with the more umm.. kinetic challenges."

---

The final approach to the Heptagram is done with the aid of Megara's sorcery. With the power of her magic, the ship appears as a night owl moving like a dark ghost through the night. Even with this work, caution is required and Meggan's perfect joining with the machine is put to the test. It clearly stuns Maragal and with the interest of a bloodline-obsessed Dynast he inquires about her parents, though he doesn't get far before the brilliant eyes of Meggan catch a terrible sight. Megara catches sight of it as well and whispers, "The Heptagram is burning."
