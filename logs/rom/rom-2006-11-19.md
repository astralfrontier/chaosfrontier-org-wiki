# Rise of Madness 2006-11-19

The beauty of the Heptagram was considered a modern wonder. It was one of the few works of the Realm that is that would not have been humbled by the Realm that was. The spires of stone and steel are strengthed by a mixture of many colors of Jade, a lattice that allows the artistry of stone and steel to care little for their normal limitations. The work was a wonder, it's beauty inspiring the students and visitors and encouraging the greatness that made the Realm the greatest power in all of Creation.

Now flames of green and red gnaw at the stone. Great towers are little more than webs of jade, groping at the sky like skeletal limbs. A bursting flame erupts again and again from the center of the structure. The sharp eyes of the Solars can make out no signs of engagement below. Meggan slows the ship and with focus conceals it against unfriendly eyes. "The docks are not destroyed," notes Megara. "But little else remains," replies Maragal. "The war has begun." The terrestrial sorceress arches an eyebrow at Maragal and asks, "But which one?"

Ryushi says little, watching the scene carefully instead. This is becoming more and more complicated, but this doesn't bother him - it seems natural and right that accomplishing his goal will be this much more difficult. It makes it feel like he is doing something truly worthwhile. "We should move," he concludes aloud.

Tanuki adjusts the straps of his breastplate, eyeing the ravaged towers cautiously. Ever the pragmatist, he remarks, "Either we missed th'action, or it's all happenin' where we can't see it." He inclines his head toward the intermittent pillar of fire. "I think I know where I'm puttin' my bets, though," he remarks. "Let's do it."

Meggan moves swiftly, hovering just above the docks. "I'm going to keep down as much as I can," she says quietly. "I will try to keep my eyes on what is going on, but it's probably not safe for me to wait right here." Megara and Maragal arm-up quickly. It seems the scholar is not going to sit on the sidelines this time. Maragal hefts his weapon with a grim expression, but says nothing, moving forward to leap out of the ship first.

Ryushi vaults out behind him, drawing his swords in midair and landing with them at the ready.

Tanuki lands on the ground behind them as softly as a fallen leaf, a fistful of darkened throwing knives clutched between his left fingers.

Megara does not hesitate, following the others. She winds about herself a sorcerous cloak like living darkness as she falls, and even those who know she is there find her hard to see after the flash of essence fades. Her voice is largely muted as she whispers, "The first thing we need to do is find the archives. I can find out where things are stored in the records. We do not want to linger here."

The best path to the archives from the docks is found to be open, but cluttered with evidence of battle. "They knew they were beaten," murmurs Maragal. For the most part, the bodies of defenders are missing, though it is clear where they fell. The blood sprays on the walls are still wet.

Megara is saved from a fall by the quickness of Tanuki, who is able to look down and see why she nearly fell. "Turned inside-out," says Megara softly. By her feet, the remains of slaughter have been left. In a way, it is merciful that they are so hard to recognize. The remains of at least two people are strewn out along the floor and wall by Megara, their skins dumped in a small pile just a few feet away. Pointedly, there are no bones to be seen.

Ryushi slashes through a nearby burning tapestry with his sword, catching the edge and sending it in a graceful glide to cover the remains in a sort of funeral shroud - at least, until the fire consumes them both. At least a small token to a life rived away by sudden supernatural violence.

Tanuki bares his teeth. "Ugh," he growls under his breath. "Damn th'monsters what did this." And to Tanuki, whoever did this _was_ a monster, and it hardly matters to him whether the monsters have human form or not - except perhaps in _how_ he will bring them down, should he encounter them.

"This isn't what I'd expect from what they had here," murmurs Megara. She frowns thoughtfully, leaning down to examine a bit of the flesh before letting the shroud cover the remains again. Maragal looks at her closely, but Megara isn't sharing her thoughts yet. "Let's get moving. This didn't happen long ago."

The path is chosen with more care with that news. Maragal looks to Ryushi and nods to the Solar. The Captain then falls to the rear, serving as the guard there. Often he moves out of sight, following paths that lead him back to the group, sometimes even emerging ahead of the others. He moves swiftly, always coming back to the rear. "More of the same," he says in a low growl.

The rest of the passageways into the Heptagram are closed off, and the party discovers that the only way through is by negotiating a narrow corridor. But at the end of it is an enormous, beautiful clockwork mechanism. "The Sword of the Mind," Megara comments. "A fiendish puzzle for would-be sorcerers. There is a solution which will allow us to bypass it, but--" Her words are cut short as Daoyang emerges from a sparkle of light and Ryushi mercilessly decimates the machinery, leaving a crude hole in the wall beyond. Megara blinks as the dust settles. "You knew the solution? That beauty must sometimes be destroyed for the sake of sorcery?" she asks, sounding a trifle surprised. "No," the Solar responds simply, then climbs through the hole he made. The Cynis sorceress adopts a bemused expression, but follows.

Maragal would laugh in better times, and will laugh when he passes on the tale of his journey with the Solars. Assuming there are days and ears to listen to such stories. For now, however, the rear guard remains silent, his eyes never resting. Megara, roused from her dark inner thoughts, begins to mumble under her breath. Ryushi is likely to know some of the words she's sifting through. She naming every species of lesser demon. It's clear she's invested a lot of study in this area lately. Her occasional tsks and grumbles indicate a failure of some kind, however.

Onward the small force goes, finally leaving the main path to head down to the archives. The darkness below is complete and finally Maragal concedes, "We haven't much a choice." He holds aloft a pair of crystals and blows across them. A lifeless, pale blue light pours from them, brighter than a torch. One of these is offered to Megara, the other to Ryushi. "I doubt we'll ever be finding the like again," says the Captain, "But we should have at least a few hours before these fail."

At the bottom of a very long staircase the exalts emerge into a set of hallways that all appear exactly the same. Fortunately Megara already told them the layout. Without that information, the searching would be long. Still, after only the third turn, Ryushi can hear that there is something loose down here still, and then he can catch motion ahead, a person running from a pair of black, amorphous shapes that race after, quickly closing the gap.

Without even waiting for an order, Tanuki darts forward in front of Ryushi and Megara, a faint gleam off the pouch of the golden sling - which he has come to call Silent Rain - as he wings two lead shot into the darkness in the distance. They bounce silently off the distant wall, the spin on the hard metal spheres diverting their course so that when they actually reach the shadowy assailants, they appear to have come from the side corridor they just passed.

The shots that Tanuki lets fly strike true, and the rushing blobs roll from the impact. They hesitate for just a moment, and then rush away, leaving the fleeing archive worker to run right into the exalts. He would run right past them if her path didn't lead right through Ryushi. The sight of another human is a great relief, and the young man falls to his knees. "They got through.. they must have. They told us they'd send help, but things were so dark, and then we heard voices, and then.." He's understanding hysterical, but Megara has no patience for this. She cuts in, "Quite snivelling. No one summoned us. We are here on our own business."

"There is a portrait we're seeking," Ryushi says. "If you fear for your life, take us to it and we'll escort you away."

"A painting?" asks the young man. "He won't know where everything is, but he can help save us time in the archives," observes Megara. This makes the young man gasp, "The archives? Go back?! Are you mad! We'll never get out alive, they'll kill us all!" Before the worker can break into still more hysterics, Megara slaps him. "Pull yourself together!" she growls. "We're going in, and we will be leaving in one piece."

The archivist seems rather incapable of calming down, but at least he's quiet, if a bit on the terrified side. "We might as well find out what we're up against," says Maragal. "Go straight in?" The Captain turns to Ryushi, letting him make the decision. Megara has to notice this, but accepts it as a matter of course.

The group, with Ryushi and Maragal armed, Megara and the archivist following, and Tanuki out of sight, travel through the few remaining hallways toward the archive. The beauty and architecture of the Heptagram visibly change, becoming more organic, less solid. Even though the blending of the walls and features is near-invisible to the eye, the transition is obvious once it's accomplished.

The softly-glowing walls which encompass the archive also show signs of an infinitely more recent history being written. The blood of man and demon alike, the holy vitae of the Dragon-Blooded mixed with the profane ichor that answers the same purpose among the erymanthoi and other creatures here.

At last the doors to the archive are found, torn off their hinges by some power of sorcery or infernalism. Ryushi steps over the shattered fragments of some unknown metal, sword at the ready.

Just inside the threshold of the archives lies a pile of remains. It seems the archivists last effort was to ensure their bodies would not damage the records here. Row upon row of cabinets with cryptic labels fill a room that would fit the airship several times over. "We need to know the contents of the holds," says Megara. The young man purses his lips and nods, looking more than a little suspicious. "I don't suppose you have a writ for this?" he asks. "Do you think that really matters right now?" asks Maragal.

"We have this," Ryu says firmly. He plunges Daoyang into the floor of the archive. "Move."

The young man nods slowly. "That will do." Even an archivist knows a thing or two, however. It soon dawns on him that the weapon is not made of jade. Megara directs him, "We are seeking Melek'tal'saran, it was part of the collection." She looks to Tanuki a moment, "And we want to access a few other items. You won't want to know about those. We'd have to kill you." Maragal says almost cheerily, "And we're already rather tempted to."

Tanuki's voice whispers from the darkness, sounding almost reassuring after Maragal's remarks. "But we ain't the demons, see. There's things you c'n do so's that we _won't_ kill you."

The archivist settles on a box, entering his passwords with a frown. Tanuki's words aren't really a comfort. He knows that if he doesn't do well, he's going to have either a sharp jade weapon or a sharp orichalcum weapon as a means to the afterlife. "It looks like Melek'tal'saran is in the third hold, west." He barely gets this out before Megara is shoving him aside. "Now, let's see.. what is near there.." If anything, she's even faster. In fact, she's soon proving far faster. Ryushi is able to catch sight of snatches of words here and there, but Megara is moving at a pace that Ami would find pleasing. "Fifth hold west is worth the time, and it will be a good path out of here. It may be burning by now, however. It's worth the risk."

A sound like a distant rumble comes from the east, and from the south at the same time. The one entrance that is torn open is no longer a safe escape. Megara, unaffected by the danger, says, "Erymanthoi packs. I guess we will go west." She turns to the broken southern doors, then looks to the east, which shudder under the force of a heavy blow.

Ryu doesn't give the doors time to fully open. He rushes forward, stabbing Daoyang between the parted doors, drawing back at the confused and painful yelp of an impaled demon. A few brief shudders reveal that the pack on the other side is preparing to make a final go of it. Noting the weakened hinges, Ryushi responds with a violent kick. The broken door is pushed outward, bowling several demons over and opening several others as targets for Tanuki.

Tanuki scatters the oncoming erymanthoi with a quick spread of shot, then takes to the rafters. A maze of fallen and standing columns, statuary alcoves, and upstairs balconies is like home to the Trickster, and lead shot rains down upon the blood-apes as if it were conjured from nothing, the young catburglar's form only briefly visible as a shadow as he flits from one bit of cover to another. Even when the demon apes see him and scramble up to give chase, they are only barely able to keep up with the agile Hidden Sun, and quickly find themselves plummeting from the heights whenever they are foolish enough to leave themselves only one handhold or foothold in their blood-thirsty pursuit.

With one door well-covered, the other is left to the Terrestrials. Maragal has trained his whole life for a day such as this, and feeling the rush of the demons nearing him, he moves, carving a path with his blade Earth's Thirst. Behind him, moving like a shadow, is Megara. Whatever weapon she uses, it is not of normal craft. Strands of blue essence shoot from her fingers and with a tug, she rips them free of demon flesh, leaving terrible rents with every strike.

Maragal, Tanuki, and Ryushi have perfected their tactics previously. Now Megara is a first-hand witness to their coordination and battle technique. Blades, knives, sling-stones, and sorcery slice down the hordes of Malfeas. The archives have not known such death in their history, but the two Solars care little for that. Now they fight for their lives, and for Ryushi, something else - a dream.

The archivist looks pale by the end of the battle. "They're.. they're.." Now he _knows_ what he just saw. He points a shaky finger at the Solars and whispers, "Anathema." Megara snorts and looks to Maragal. The Captain responds to this unuttered command by bringing the hilt of his sword down on the archivist's head. The young man crumples to the floor, unconcious, but not seriously hurt. In short order Megara and Maragal file the young man away, stuffing him somewhere in the Ls. "For lost people. It's a standard procedure," deadpans Megara. It's hard to tell if she's serious or not.

There is little time to linger. If anything, that act may save the archivist's life. The door to the west is opened and for a moment, the exalts strain their ears, and then they are plunging forward into the halls. In the heat of the moment, memories of maps and layouts are easy to forget, but Maragal and Megara know this place too well, and easily wind a course to the Third Hold, shifting pathways when a turned corner opens into a scene of burning Malfean fire.

The door to the Third Hold has been smashed-in, and a the body of a great demon lays here, torn in many places by claws and covered with marks of teeth. "The guardian remained bound enough to die fighting." As Megara speaks, Maragal takes a few steps to the side of the damaged door and with a growl stabs his blade through the wall. He rips it free with a grunt. "Just being cautious."

Inside, the hold has been thoroughly raided, crates smashed, things cast across the floor. Megara steps through the ruins, hunting, but Ryushi needs not look. He can feel the pull. He can walk right through the crowded room and rip the cover off of a large crate. The painting lies inside, and for the first time, he is able to see the full glory of the painting, his dreams living in front of him.

As the painting is lifted, the figure of the woman on it turns and smiles at the exalt. "Ryushi, you've finally come for me," she says warmly. "I've been waiting so long, but now you are here. We're together again, just like you promised we'd be."

Ryushi is caught pretty much completely by surprise. The Heptagram, the Realm, the presence of the 10,000 Dragons and the demon hordes, all are gone. He stares for long moments, then finally musters words. "You're safe now."

Tanuki glares suspiciously at the painting, though he says nothing. Magic and sorcery are still not a thing he is comfortable with, and he still has the mortal man's distrust of anything that talks where you can't see where it keeps its brain. Maybe this painting wishes well for Ryushi, but the Trickster has come to see his fellow Solar as a close friend, and _anything_ that may have designs on his friend is suspicious until it's earned his trust.
