# Rise of Madness 2006-12-02

The third day of Ryushi's initiation into sorcery has concluded itself, and Cynis Megara has lost some of her cold detachment. What has replaced it is awe, jealousy, fear, and (most interestingly) a seeming burning sense of kinship with a fellow-sorcerer. The initiation has had perhaps a more profound effect on the teacher than on the student. Though he has learned no true spells yet, his "graduation" is an explanation of the profound ramifications of the power he now draws on.

Sorcery, he is told, is not merely the shaping of existing Essence, but something entirely new. Such a power can even remake the Wyld if applied properly, and Ryushi listens carefully to this. For the island Alissa spoke of, the island where she could be freed, is entirely trapped in the Wyld.

With this knowledge, he speaks to the portrait again. "How is it that you may be freed? What is the nature of that place that permits it?"

"I only know that it is destined that I be freed there," replies Alissa. She is basking on the beach as usual, but the scene has changed, lit by the moon with the waves rolling in. "The work was done by others. They assured me that is where it will happen and only there can it be done."

"Are there gods, or other living beings, who might still live and know of this?" Ryu asks, turning ideas over in his mind.

"The work was not done by gods," replies Alissa. "But in Yu-Shan there are gods for every kind of knowledge or ignorance."

"How would I get there?" asks Ryu.

Alissa laughs gently, "There are many ways, but you are not yet ready to do so. Yu-Shan is the city of the gods." Her expression grows more serious, "With so much lost, it is likely now a city of tombs and silent monuments to better days."

"Then I must attempt to find - or to remake - the island. I must find the masters of the Wyld..." The swordsman thinks. The Celestials - the Anathema - the Lunars, living on the fringes of civilization. Sometimes said to be bitter enemies of the Fair Folk, sometimes said to be their closest allies. The tattooed shapeshifters are known in myth and legend, but what lurks behind those stories. "I must find the Lunars."

"You had best proceed with caution. The Lunars have always been prickly about matters of etiquette and respect," replies Alissa. "A wrong step may make your cause far harder, and you were never much of a diplomat. That I can tell has not changed."

"I am my own man," Ryushi replies quietly. "You speak of the me that was the past, but all I truly know is the me of the present. I don't even remember my Exaltation, only the consequences of it. Though I value what you tell me of the past, I cannot be that man. I can only be myself."

"Because of what you were given, I know much of who you are and who you will be," replies Alissa. "You will still be yourself, but I know most of who that is just because you were Chosen. Your audacity and honorable accounting of yourself in battle proves that you are the correct man to bear that crown."

"Then I must find a Lunar who remembers who I was as well as you do," Ryu remarks with a dry smile. "I suspect you do not know where to seek them out. But I know one who might."

"I cannot tell you where they might be now," replies Alissa. "I have been shown the maps. While many things remain, much of the greatest Lunar tribal grounds have been consumed. They must be very angry and more focused than ever. I think you should know that they are nearly as formidible as Solars, and their many years will make them extremely powerful, indeed."

Ryushi smiles calmly. "Then they will become my allies."

---

Tanuki, meanwhile, is slowly running out of things to do. Running around the rooftops of the city isn't nearly as thrilling now that there are no demons trying to rip him to shreds - just Clockworks and various servants of Ami who warn him away from hazardous areas. Dodging _these_ proves to be temporary sport, but their warnings are sincere; a near-miss with a sudden fountain of lava, while exciting, isn't the kind of excitement Tanuki wants to pursue for its own sake.

Not only that, but there's a shortage of prank victims. Ryushi, Megara, Maragal, and Ami are people he respects too much to do more than the most light-hearted of pranks, and he cares for Meggan far too much to prank her at all - although he does enjoy spending time with her. Living in a nearly-deserted city like this reminds Tanuki that life is far more fun with real challenges, real rewards, and annoying people to torment.

So when Ryushi comes to him, there's some real impatience for action behind Tanuki's words. "Well, hello there Ryushi. Ya done goin to school for a while, then?"

Ryushi nods and smiles. "How'd you like to make a mockery of the Wyld Hunt?" he asks casually.

Tanuki dangles by his toes from a ledge. "Don't they go round huntin' demons and stuff?" He blinks. "Oh, _right_. They think guys like you 'n me're demons, right?"

Ryushi nods. "And the Lunar Exalted as well. Of any group in Creation, they are the most likely to know where to find the Lunars, and who among them we could speak to. We must make contact with these people."

Tanuki grins. "Should be easy enough to do _that_. Just go an' light up like a torch in th'middle of any big city, right? Course, then we gotta make 'em sit still long enough ta talk." He pulls himself up by his toes and somersaults, alighting on the ledge. "Count me in."

Ryushi flashes a brief, but confident smile. "Perhaps more subtlety than that, but yes. They presumably keep records - we need access to them. I doubt they will speak to us as we are. Perhaps they'd be amenable to a disguise as well - I leave that to you, though I'll stand by you if there's fighting."

Tanuki strolls briskly along the ceiling, the empty circle glimmering on his forehead as he does so. He's never been the sort to sit still, and Solar magic has greatly expanded the scope of his impatient pacing. "So who would they speak to, d'you think? I don't know much about 'em, but if we c'n figure out who they _will_ give the time o' day to, I might be able to work somethin' out."

Ryushi shrugs. "I was about to go ask Megara for suggestions. Come with me."

---

The swordsman outlines his idea to Cynis Megara, with Tanuki as his candidate for infiltrator. What he needs most is the location of the Hunt's headquarters in the southwest, and ideas about approach. As long as it does no damage to Megara or her interests, Ryushi reasons, the sorceress will not object to information-gathering like this.

Megara has had some trouble keeping in touch with matters back on the isle. "I know that when things were normal, the hunt had a large castle fortified at Sion. I don't know how easily you will be able to reach it now. I cannot reach any of my agents right now. I have learned from a friend that Pangu has been utterly destroyed by House Mnemon. Cathak is trying to sit on the fences still, but they will have to make a choice soon. I have no confirmation of the rest."

Ryushi hums at the news. "In extremis, we can provoke the Wyld Hunt with a demonstration, as Tanuki demonstrated. It should be possible to trace them back to their base of operations thereafter."

"Perhaps," replies Megara. "I think it would be wiser to just get the information you want from them. If you draw them out with a display, it will only make the risks greater and possibly throw away the information you want. You are strong, but I should remind you that the Wyld Hunt is not weak, and in Sion they are strong enough to deal with you if you challenge them openly."

Ryushi nods. "Then if Tanuki is willing, that is what I propose we do next. But I still have business with Ami, and I do not compel any of you to come with me on my searches."

"Fair nuff," says Tanuki, dangling from a guy wire. "I'd rather not go makin a big fuss anyhow. Much more fun when they don't see ya comin' or goin'." He swings down and perches on the back of a tall chair. "Sounds like lotsa fun."

"Well, you know how boring it'd be to just sit around here and watch Ami pull miracles out of the dirt," replies Megara. She looks thoughtful for a moment, "Actually it's not boring. It's incredible and very frustrating.. because I'll never get it all written down. At least I did get a few of those drones started in making actual books of lore instead of just storing it on those.. consoles." She looks to Tanuki and then to Ryushi, "If you think I'm useful in this, I will go, otherwise I'll just produce a map. There's too much of interest down here to just walk away if I'm not serving a purpose."

Ryushi shakes his head. "Not for the infiltration. Your most valuable asset is your mind, in my experience." He pauses, reflecting on something, then seems to come to resolution. "I must speak to Ami. Perhaps she can finish by the time I need it...." And so saying, he heads out.

---

The swordsman next seeks out Ami, the de facto ruler of the Golden City. He has studied much of the old wonders and ancient lore, and his resolution is such that he will even reforge his own body into the weapon the world requires. He describes to Ami two miracles he has read about - the skin-mount amulet in which a Hearthstone can be set, increasing the Exalt's own personal power in the process, and the aegis-inset amulets commonly worn by the famed Gunzosha pilots of the Seventh Legion. The armor-amulets are even useful for Exalts, he has learned, easing the weight of attunement to magical armor such as the breastplate he wears. In the coming fights, and in the challenge to Octavian, he will need every bit of power he can acquire.

Meeting Ami is not a difficult proposition. Every console is connected. As for her real physical being, that has been shifting about a great deal. Most of the time she sits in the greatest of the Factory Cathedrals, growing ever more tuned into the city that she is raising from the ashes of history. On the way to meet her, Ryushi passes Maragal, who is busy chatting with a rather imposing automaton. With just the bit that the exalts hear as they pass it is clear that Maragal is explaining to it the military laws of the Realm, not to mention engaging it in a game of gateway as he does so.

Ami is as 'at ease' as she gets. Strands of glowing essence fan out from her fingertips as she listens to Ryushi's words. "So you wish to make yourself more of what you are. You must do so, I think, if you wish to survive." She says softly, "The dead cannot build, and my creations cannot defend against what is to come without aid." She looks to her right and an image of vivid light simply comes into being in mid-air. She studies it carefully and nods, "I will prepare something for you, but it will take time. By morning I should know exactly how long."

Tanuki speaks up as well. "Another set of bracers like what Ryushi's got would be handy," he comments. "And while Ryu an' Megara were talkin, I overheard 'em talkin about a kinda armor that's just bracelets an' anklets, but when ya turn it on it covers yer whole body. Something like that'd be just the thing fer when I need protection an' can't be seen luggin around a whole bunch o' this orichalcum stuff on my chest."

"I see," murmurs Ami. "So an armor of stealth, a pair of bracers, and something to make Ryushi more formidible, able to challenge even Octavian the undefeatable." She does not have in her head the desire to precisely recreate the old, but clearly to meet the need and outdo the glories of the past. "I can do these things. To purify that much orichalcum will take some time. I know where to look, however." She turns to the west, "Twenty three leagues in that direction, one hundred paces down. There is a great vein of gold there, and the beginnings of the mine that led to the construction of the nation of which this city was simply an outpost."

Ryushi nods. "We will face the Wyld Hunt, but I'll be useless for such a thing - only there to support Tanuki. If you require assistance, I stand ready."

"There is something more," says Ami. "I need you to open the mine to my drones. I think there may be some difficulty of some kind. Nothing too serious, but I do not wish to go there myself. It's hard to synchronize with the city's pulse from scratch and I haven't developed that kind of range yet. Fortunately, you are about to help with that. Near the mine is a manse. I need you to realign it. I think your studies as of late prove you are able to handle this, Ryushi. No building will be needed. You should be able to.. feel your way." Her attention drifts over to Tanuki, "Don't take Meggan too close to that mine. It's a bit dangerous for us. For one not Chosen of the Sun, it is death."

---

The _Sun's Messenger_ settles down on a dune, its landing legs finding purchase on the sand. In the middle distance, the outline of the manse is visible through a cloud of dust blown by a wandering gust of wind, and the energy released by the confluence of the dragon lines is strong enough to be felt even by Tanuki. Tanuki squeezes Meggan's hand. "This time, don't come fer us," he says. "Ami says it's too dangerous. Don't worry, we'll be able to get out on our own this time."

The manse is a strange affair. While most that the exalts have seen and heard of have been rather grand, this one is surprisingly spartan. The construction seems made entirely of sand spun into a crystal. The times have not been cruel to the manse, though there is certainly enough wear to appear at a distance. At first, the concept or realignment seems rather meaningless, but when Ryushi and Tanuki get closer they begin to have guesses as to what it means. The manse has no less than fifty dangling crystals that look like chandeliers, but their purpose is not to shed light, but to gather it and use the essence of the sun to properly draw on the powers of the dragonline below.

Calmly the swordsman sits down in a kneeling position, neutralizing the various forces of his body and mind, consciously exerting the discipline that all warriors unthinkingly exercise in the moments before their death. He is balanced, neutral, symmetrical, open. He considers the crystals, forming them into different configurations in his mind, drawing a trickle of Solar Essence and searching his feelings and intuition. What he knows now is less important than what comes naturally to him - for Balas often said that occultism was the formalization of intuition about Essence. In his mind's eye, the crystal's shapes evolve slowly toward their proper configuration, and every breath he takes in the spartan structure brings in more Essence to whisper the truth to him.

With contemplation comes wisdom; with confidence comes success. Since his Exaltation, Ryushi has been aware that he is one of the most agile men alive - Tanuki can no doubt challenge him in this regard, but he has balanced full wine-glasses on the tip of a finger. It is with this confidence that he exerts his grace, calling forth the well of Solar perfection that still lies in his heart, rearranging the crystals to conform to his vision. A small thing, a tiny thing, compared to reshaping Creation. But it is a step along that road.

---

Tanuki is still not entirely comfortable with a desert, but he uses the same methodical approach he takes toward casing a joint - circling around the entire area, probing whatever looks promising, sending in Ami's digging drones whenever he sees something that doesn't 'look right'. It takes quite a while, as his sense of what 'looks right' is less than experienced with the organic contours of Nature, so the ingenious machines dig a number of pits that disturb nothing more than slumbering snakes that had been avoiding the sun's heat; in the end, it is his anima that is as much of a help as anything else, the guidance of the Solar spark within him giving him guidance toward the opening long since reclaimed by the Desert.

After his many attempts, Tanuki strikes paydirt. The drones begin their excavation. Fortunately their speed is great, and the mine, once cleared, is curiously unfilled. After an hour of digging Tanuki is confronted with the great opening of a most sacred place. Sacred and far from undefended. The drones have been wisely built not to attempt entry, but Tanuki still must warn them away from continuing their work.

In front of Tanuki stands the maw of the great mine, and to his eyes what is obvious to others would be completely imperceptible. He can see lines of sunlight spanning the room like thread, only impossibly fine. Past this great first chamber lies what is clearly a control module of some kind. But to get there must be impossible, for there is no opening between those threads great enough for a man to crawl.

Tanuki scratches his head. "Heyoka, do you think you c'n crawl in there between those lines?" The lizard-creature looks at Tanuki in puzzlement. _What lines?_ Tanuki is nonplused. "All those little threads of sunlight. They must be some kinda tripwires... Hm. You can't see 'em, huh? All 'ight, looks like it's up ta me."

Tanuki rubs his hands together, and licks his lips, grinning. This is much more fun than playing dodgeball with spark-gaps in Ami's city. He spends but a moment studying the layout, trusting in his instincts to get him through. And with that, he takes a running leap, diving forward and sucking in his gut, passing through a gap five feet up with fractions of an inch to spare. This only takes him into the midst of the maze of light, though, and he lands on the fingers of one hand. The space of floor is too narrow for more than his hand and wrist, and so he uses that hand as a springboard, launching himself toward the cave wall.

The circle of the Night gleams into existence on his brow, for there is no further landing point he can reach while leaping from this wall. Instead, he runs _along_ the wall and up the ceiling, before pouncing toward the cavern floor, arresting his fall with an arm and a leg poised precariously over a delicate webbing of light. The best of mortal gymnasts would be challenged to stay upright from such a landing, but Tanuki bends his body like a hooked fish, ducking bonelessly under another beam, and leaping for the ceiling again, somersaulting in mid-flight to avoid yet another golden tripwire in his path.

As Tanuki alights in front of the console at the far end, he reaches for it... but before he can even move, he senses movement behind him. He turns... and the webbing of light trembles, and spirals toward him. It is, somehow, not a threatening gesture... instead, the lines of light begin to spool themselves around his Caste Mark, wrapping around the glimmering golden circle like thread on a reel. He can _feel_ the presence of the delicate trap, and knows that it was intended to pass none but the children of the Sun. It has recognized him, and is under his command, and he can put it back where it was when he leaves. Grinning, he passes in deeper, bringing the light of Helios with him.

The mines of Creation today are dark, inhospitable places where workers die in droves to the wrath of unruly elementals and cave-ins. The mines the Solars built are wonders of architecture, breath-takingly beautiful in their fine use of straight lines and powerful arches. There are many rooms built into the mine whose purpose is unclear, but one of these has running water still in it and some remains. Tanuki sees on the ground a skeleton. Ami must have known it was here. On its arms are bracers of orichalcum and near it is a skeleton still wearing jade armor. Other jade implements and skeletal remains are found around the room.

Water is a precious resource underground, so it is no surprise that the remains of the dead congregate here. Still, that which has killed another - and one of them wearing bracers of the Sun - may kill you. Tanuki takes the time to study the bones, examining the lay of each one in itself and relative to the others. Are the bodies clenched in the agony of poison? Are the bones notched or broken by force of arms? Or are they merely curled up in the posture of those whose rations have run out and have laid down to die?

Satisfied, Tanuki kneels by the body of the fallen Solar, and gently untangles the golden armor from its arm bones, laying the bleached white shards back where they were found. Taking the example of Ryushi, he closes his eyes, resting his fingertips on the skull's forehead, and mumbles a short prayer. "Rest well, hero, an' know that these'll see the light o' the Sun once more, an' make their mark on th' world of men." He slips his arms into the bracers; they fit a little loosely at first, but as with _Silent Rain_ and the breastplate he now wears, he feels the golden metal begin to draw his Essence into their form. By the time he meets with Ryushi again, they will fit like a second skin.

---

The Dawn Caste is resting in the Manse, drawing on the ambient Essence of the holy site and watching the crystals. He's barely aware of Tanuki's entrance, so entrancing is the display. Ripples and whorls of light play between the structure of the crystals, forming small geometric shapes that model organic flow when viewed from a larger perspective before abruptly reversing the pattern and becoming elaborately symmetrical mandalas of leaves or other flowing, natural patterns.

Tanuki makes his way carefully through the outer courtyards, passing between rainbows that warm him from the inside, before pausing beside Ryushi, and sitting down cross-legged beside him. As impatient as the young Solar can be, he too can appreciate beauty, and he is content to sit and wait until Ryushi is ready to move on.
