# Rise of Madness 2006-12-09

Sion. The name proves to be a byword for zealotry and strength. While many know of the Wyld Hunt, those who truly control it in the absence of the Empress are a mystery. While their motives are not doubted, their methods surely are. Rumors of human sacrifice and every manner of dark heresy surround the fortress at Sion. The monks and warriors who dwell there are of the highest level, the circle within the inner circle.

The only mortals in the fortress are those who are magically bound to live their whole lives there. Even a step outside will kill them. In cases where servants are needed to cross that absolute border the Wyld Hunt has purchased deaf mutes, trained to do their tasks with absolute loyalty but not allowed inside the fortress proper. Instead, the goods they gather are left at the threshold for the servants of the house to bring inside. The two sides are never allowed to see each other.

The fortress itself has many defenses, both mundane and arcane. As Maragal explained it is a very tough nut to crack. Unlike the Heptagram, there are no demons kept inside. In the place of such defenders are the finest Immaculate monks. These are not students, but well-trained warriors, many of whom have lived for centuries . None have achieved less than fifty successful hunts, dealing with all manner of anathema.

Beyond this terrestrial talent, the walls are defended by many layers of sorcerous barriers. These Megara and Ryushi will handle together. Her knowledge runs deep, but she admits that there are some mystic defenses that she is not aware of. "It will not matter too much, however. I have picked-up something that will tilt the scales, courtesy of Ami."

Tanuki rolls a lead pebble around on his hand. "So... I gotta get some records on these guys called Lunars, right? How'll I know which ones I need? It might not say Lunars on the paper. So what kinda things're the Wyld Hunt likely to say about 'em?" This is going to be one of the most difficult heists of his career to date - for once, he's going to be a bit wary about bringing home extras.

Ryushi recites from his memory of Balas' teachings. "The Lunars, the Shapeshifters, the Anathema of the Moon. The Moon-Children, the Animals, the Dire Beasts, the Thousand-Faced Fiends." He recites a few other names in High Realm, showing Tanuki the written forms as well for memorization purposes. "Encountered beyond the boundaries of the Threshold, near the Wyld. Said to hate the Guild and the Realm, and all their works."

"I'd say that part is not just propoganda," notes Maragal. "They definitely hate the Realm and the Guild, just to varying degrees. Before the recent troubles I would have said they were the only real threat to the Realm. Now the Realm is the biggest threat to the Realm." He snorts in disgust, "They're all grabbing for power now. Anyway, Master Ryushi is right on the names. The records will be in a lower vault."

Tanuki studies the written words like he would a floor plan, doing his best to commit them to memory. If there's one thing he is good at, it's finding the familiar details hidden in a thicket of distractions. "So keep going down... got it. Sounds like it's gonna be tons o' fun." There's a hint of irony in his voice - somehow, the potency of Sion's paranoid defenses has gotten through even to him.

"Look on the bright side," says Megara. "What you are stealing is only considered a dangerous secret. There are things in Sion that are far harder to reach, some sorcerous traps that the Wyld Hunt uses but cannot actually explain. Now I think I know who the original builders of those traps was." She looks to Ryushi, "Even so, you are no match for them. Yet. You have a few months left where I guide you in your learning." She sighs almost wistfully before turning to Tanuki, "I believe you can do this."

Tanuki grins. "Well who can ask fer better, eh? Of course I c'n do it. It's just I'm not stealing a couple baubles from Simeon the Fat, know what I'm sayin? I gotta watch my step."

Maragal barks a laugh. "Anyhow, I think you know just about all we can tell ya. It's gonna be a rush job getting in and out, but I'll tell you there's nothing in the navy that can match the Sun's Messenger for speed or maneuverability." More soberly Megara notes, "That you know of."

Tanuki still has more preparation to do, but Ryushi's business isn't in Sion. The Solar therefore returns to the Golden City. What is to come will require knowledge and power, and he must acquire both. He goes before Ami again, asking her about the inset amulets they spoke of earlier.

Each meeting with Ami is slightly different, and the city is changing so swiftly. Alphapolis is over twice as large, and the drones move about it like ants around their hill. Ryushi can also observe that the sacred mine is being used. In accordance with her faith, Ami only allows drones made of pure orichalcum to mine the most sacred of materials.

Ryushi finds himself directed towards the city center. Arriving at night allows him to see a marvelous spectacle. Ami has set flames to dance about the great center in every color. When at last he finds the Solar she is lounging on a divan. For once, she is free of wires, though the pace of her speech makes Ryushi suspect her attention is divided even without them. "You have returned! Good, good! I have been working at your project ever since you left." Obviously she has thought of this moment as well, for two drones are waiting for Ryushi, each bearing a tray of gold, on which are set chalices of orichalcum. These are filled with a liquid that glints brightly in the light. "It is most difficult to keep the most precious of metals as a liquid," explains Ami. "But for this, it was utterly necessary."

Ryushi nods. "I fight, you build," he says simply. "Our power is magnified when we work together."

Ami sighs softly. "Yes, there is that." She looks over Ryushi slowly, studying him in the same way he has seen her study her most fascinating projects. "Well, I believe you are strong enough for this, but it is not something I have tested on others. Usually one would put this under the flesh after it is made, but that seems so.. terrestrial." She smirks impishly and rolls onto her stomach, kicking her heels lazily and staring at Ryushi's face. "It's going to hurt you, of course. Even our veins aren't accustomed to orichalcum, but for anyone else it would be instantly fatal. Do you think you are strong enough to endure it?"

"I've earned the emnity of a demon of the Second Circle," the swordsman answers calmly. "Think of this as training."

"Ah, good! You have been working," replies Ami. She sounds very pleased. "It's so good to see you use your gifts well. I was afraid you were not achieving your dreams out there. I shouldn't have all the fun." Her eyes remain locked on Ryushi's as she explains, "You will be drinking the two chalices. Once you are ready. Having done this myself, I can only suggest you sit or lie down so you don't crack your head falling over."

Something occurs to Ryu, and he speaks again. "Oh yes. If your drones are capable of manufacturing high-quality weapons, I have a request that they can fulfill."

"Name it," replies Ami. "They cannot really make them technically, but my essence flows now through every drone in this city. What is my power is their's." She stretches, catlike, and explains, "I am tapped into five different manses, not even counting the city's central grid."

"I need flawless weapons," Ryushi replies. He reaches for a chalice, lifting it to his lips. "All of them."

"Ahh, well," murmurs Ami. "That is simple enough. I'll have a new mine built for you. There is a place only a few miles from here that I think will yield the iron I need, and the fires of this city can turn them into a steel harder than those they make now in the Realm." She looks thoughtful and asks, "Shall I make enough for an army?"

Ryushi's first impression is a feeling of resonance. It is clear that this would only work with this matching of essences, the most holy of metals mingling with the most powerful of the Chosen. The next is a sensation of his body being shifted as the truegold rushes into his veins. He feels a wetness on both his arms about the biceps and finds he is bleeding, but there is no pain. "Hmm, it worked better," she whispers.

The second chalice is much like the first. cutting his arms and bleeding him for a moment, then stopping once more. Ami rises and takes from a drone a third chalice, and this she empties on Ryushi's wounded arms, washing away the blood to reveal what she has made. On his arms Ryushi can watch the final shaping of two sockets. Ami guides this last work, her fingertips erupting into millions upon millions of fine, orichalcum threads, each darting in and forming the artifacts. Ami's threads not only alter the orichalcum, but also the bearer. They dip through Ryushi's flesh, causing no harm, but instead aligning his essence, so that there will be no need of attunement. "One in the same," Ami mumbles softly.

Ryushi does not flinch or cry out. The sign of his endurance is seen only in close inspection - the beads of sweat forming on his forehead and prickling his skin, the grinding of his teeth. He simply waits, and suffers, knowing that mortal men and women in the East have endured implantations of this type. He must show strength befitting a Solar.

Ami focuses her mind utterly on her task. The tugging at Ryushi's essence causes his anima banner to flare up for a moment, then die down as Ami perfects her work. This done, her attention drifts to the physical, and the building of the sockets is rushed on at a frantic pace. Finally she closes the wound that she has opened and steps back, leaving the beautiful work for Ryushi to examine. "It is my finest work," says Ami.

It's felt like an eternity, but Ryushi focuses himself again. He flexes a hand, watching the tendons ripple, staring at the jewel-like node at his elbow where the lines of his body converge. There are other focal points as well, and he pauses to run a finger across some of them experimentally. He's now somehow different, but he finds himself accepting it. "Very good. I need to speak to Alissa," he says. His voice cracks, but he can still be heard.

"Of course," says Ami. "I have put her in one of the palaces. She said she liked the view from the balcony." The Solar looks to one of the golden drones and says, "Please show Lord Ryushi to the Palace of the Inked Maiden." Ami again settles herself on the divan, sprawling out and looking up at the great tower. "I wish you good luck in your journeys, Ryushi. Alissa's tale is one I hope you will tell me in full one day."

---

The Lawgiver follows his escort, finding Alissa's portrait hanging as described. He smiles faintly as he watches it, giving himself a few seconds to consider before speaking. "Hello Alissa. Do you have time?"

Alissa is found on a dark beach, staring out over the city with a smile. She perks up at the sound of Ryushi's voice. With a playful laugh she notes, "I seem to have nothing else, my Lord."

"I work to rectify that," Ryushi says, flushing a bit. He knows he's not shirking his duty, but even so standing around as he is makes him feel impatient to go out and act. "While I recuperate from the work Ami has done for me, I wanted to ask you about yourself. Your place in the Celestial order. Your duties, your rights, and so on. They must be restored when you are, after all."

"Oh, well, I was very important in the west," says Alissa. "Though I'm afraid most of the west that I knew has apparently gone away. Still, I am hopeful that things will be set right again. Now that you are back I know things will all be set right." She looks thoughtful and admits, "I really didn't work all that hard. I just gave people hope. No one could see me and not believe that their dreams could come true. No matter how impossible things might seem, they could always turn to me for inspiration."

Ryushi nods, turning this over in his mind. "Then I would say you still have some power, for here I am." He looks out the window, finding himself drawn to the view as well. "We will surely turn back the Wyld. Tanuki will return safely, with the information we need. We will find the Lunars and show them the wisdom of joining with us."

"I don't know if I'd put it precisely like that when you speak with them," replies Alissa. "Tread carefully with them. They have always been creatures focused on honor and respect. You are powerful, yet to them you are still a child. Whatever you do, do not try to manipulate them. The Solars and Lunars were always open with each other. That is what made their bond so powerful."

"You think me one to manipulate?" Ryushi asks in genuine surprise. "I will speak to them as I have spoken to you and all others."

"Not you," replies Alissa. "But the other one has a silver tongue." She laughs merrily and looks out over the city. "It is a very beautiful city. You know, Ami made the lights for me? They are quite lovely. It's not quite the way it was in the west. The dancing waters are hard to rival, still.. it is beautiful in its own right, and it's a kindness that makes me feel safe and welcome here."

"Ami will keep it that way. As for me.." Ryushi turns. "I've got to go. More training, more preparation. We'll finish this soon."
