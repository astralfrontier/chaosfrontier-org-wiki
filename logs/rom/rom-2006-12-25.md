# Rise of Madness 2006-12-25

After the raid on Sion, Ryushi has perhaps more information than he really knows what to do with. The data comes in several forms, but the most useful information is the newest of reports on the Anathema of the Moon and the oldest, strange crystals that give images of things long since lost to the world.

The reports of the current Lunars depict an unflattering image of savage creatures that lurk far from the haunts of men, striking suddenly and without mercy. The Wyld Hunt's records against these particular Anathema is far from stellar. There are unprecedented reports of prisoners retaken and Wyld Hunters destroyed. It is a contradictory report. To Ryushi, it is obvious that the Lunars are far from savages, but cunning warriors with great love of their own people. Enough love to risk their very lives saving their inexperienced kin in any circumstance.

Through a long list of recorded names Ryushi finds one that is promising. He is able to look into the current stories and trace them back into the older records. He finds one Anathema called 'The Crazy Tusk', who dwells far to the south and east of Chaya. In the depths of the distant woods this ancient sage is said to live. Ryushi's exploration of the Old Realm's records give this woman a name: Eliara Mal'Areena, once called the Queen of Flowing Garlands.

With the _Sun's Messenger_ again ready to depart, Ryushi takes the opportunity to study other old records - learning crystals from the doomed island. He has what Alissa has told him, he has what the Wyld Hunt has paid blood to learn, and he has his own instinct. He resolves to transform knowledge into victory, and as the skyship makes its way east, he studies.

The voyage is not a short one, but the spectacle of the great forests and jungles of the east rewards the patience of the Lawgiver. The air here feels alive, putting a tingle into the skin. All of the sudden Meggan laughs out loud, then grows quiet again. One cannot help but feel a bit strange with so much energy in the air.

It is difficult for her to find a place suitable to land. She finally settles the ship on the great limb of a massive tree. It is easily the largest Ryushi has seen, its roots lost in the mists below. "I don't think I can safely go below," Meggan explains. "But you've never had trouble climbing before."

Ryushi has prepared for this moment. Strapped to his back is a large bundle, exhuding a smell of herbs and incense and blood. He leaps over the side, landing casually on his feet, and disappears into the forest.

---

The swordsman kneels in a cleared space. Before him, the ground has been carefully picked over for leaves, twigs, and other impurities. Only the earth remains, and in the rich soil of the southeast he has carved glyphs and words in Old Realm and other, more esoteric tongues. Four yarrow stalks are planted in the ground, one for each compass point. At the center of his diagram is a haunch of meat, poured over with hints of his own blood. Without spirit power of its own, no mortal animal can approach the diagram while his power lays on the ward; only the god-animals of the forest can freely pass. Thus prepared, Ryushi withdraws to his place of concealment and waits.

In the east, the forests are alive with spirits and small gods. On the eaves of Crazy Tusk's territories, the answer comes in the form of a glowing spider of many hues, changing constantly from green to brown and back, copying the transforming colors of leaves. It stoops over the offering and examines it, then settles on its rear legs, arching its back and beating at the air in a strange dance. "Ai yiyiyiyi! Ai yiyiyi!" it calls out loudly. "Many seasons have passed in the world outside since the Lawgivers have come here," it says at last, "Yet the Spinner of Seasons has not forgotten their ways."

Ryushi rises and approaches, warily. An offering is only a call, not a commandment, and even the Lawgivers may be attacked. "I seek Eliara Mal'Areena, the Queen of Flowing Garlands. I seek knowledge."

The Spinner of Seasons raises its forelegs and sways them strangely. "Ai! Yiyiyi! Aiaiaiai!" it replies. "Yes, of course. Eliara! Aiaiai! I do not know that she will see you, Lawgiver. She must not be fond of guests!" It dances around Ryushi, spinning and rising in ways that no normal spider ever would. "You see, she has not seen anyone in a hundred spinnings! Still, I will send word to her, but only the spinning is promised, no more."

"Nothing more could be asked," Ryu answers calmly. "For this I thank you."

"Aiyiyiyiyi!" The spider tilts and dances for a moment longer, than in a bursting of light it races to the east, moving so fast Ryushi is barely able to catch sight of it, and soon it is gone. Ryushi then can only wait, and there is much waiting. No return answer comes for three hours, and it is not carried by the Spinner, but by an odd creature like a large squirrel, but with a tail longer than a man's arm and a full coat of grey and white fur. It's voice is more crude than the Spinner's, but it is easy to understand. "You may enter the borders of the Queen. Make for the east and wait at the bottom of the great falls."

Ryushi gathers his things and closes the ward. Without a word he rises and sets out. Fate will determine where he goes, and what he finds there.

The journey is not a difficult one. Ryushi gets a feeling the land is watching him. The trees move slightly out of his way, and branches are trembling as they hold back. The feeling of life is growing stronger here, and there's a strange scent in the air. The Lawgiver sees trees that were ancient before the Realm was betrayed, the moss on these trees may have been here before men walked. For the longest time, there is no sign of any falling water. Indeed, the only water Ryushi senses is that of the mists and the dew on the bark of the great trees.

The search ends as Ryushi suddenly finds himself in a great clearing. All the sudden the turf is free of trees, covered instead only by a pale fluff. A soft, white snow is falling over the ground here, crumbling into a finer dust shortly after it settles.

When it touches Ryushi's skin, he can sense it is not snow, but the light cotton of a seed's parachute. "Welcome to the Great Falls," calls out a soft voice. The form of a lithe, white-haired woman slips out of thin air in front of Ryushi. At the crown of her head he can see a tusk that fades in and out of existance, changing in forms constantly. "Welcome, Lawgiver." There is a stiff formality in her words, and her eyes-a shocking lilac-settle on Ryushi's as she waits.

The warrior clasps his hands together, one palm enclosing one fist, a sign of respect and peaceful intent. He decides that in lieu of direct action or etiquette, truth must suffice. "I have been Exalted only a short time. To learn your name and home, my comrade stole the records of the Wyld Hunt from Sion. To follow my dream, I have reclaimed a trapped god from the Heptagram and cut Octavian. I have tasted glory. I come to you to find wisdom."

Eliara looks thoughtful a moment. It's clear she wasn't expecting that answer. It's no less obvious that she is pleased to hear of the attack on Sion. After making Ryushi wait a full minute for some sign, she smiles and laughs. "Yes, of course, a most impetuous creature. You must be of the Dawn Caste. Your tongue is unskilled in the telling of lies, yet your mind is the best part of you." She moves closer, and that horn turns moonsilver for just a moment, then fades away again. "What wisdom is it you seek, child? I am of the Moon and you the Sun, but there is much I might tell you."

Ryushi's eyes flicker upward to the horn, then to Eliara again. "There is an island to the west. It was swallowed up by the Wyld, long ago. I wish to push back the Wyld and reclaim this place. So I sought those with experience in such matters."

"I see," murmurs Eliara. "Well, you have chosen wisely, for few that live have faced the Wyld and won as many times as I have." The Lunar stands proudly for a moment, then laughs lightly as the wind moves through the clearing. "But pride is not what pushes back the mouth of Chaos. It is force of will and force of arms." She gestures for Ryushi to walk with her and she moves slowly towards the center of the clearing, towards the bole of a tree as vast as a mountain. "Once we were strong enough to hold back the Wyld simply by treaty and desire. When the Sun and Moon were at their zenith and the Stars were bound to their will all things were in order and the power of the Word was mighty enough to terrify all but the most valiant of the enemies."

"We are not what we were," says Eliara at last. "I see no reason to deceive you in this. It is obvious. The Sun has been weak in the sky for too long, and the light of the Moon must come first from the day star." She smiles sadly, "It shames me, but we are far less without you. I will not pretend otherwise." She stops near the bole of the tree and settles on the turf, where a great feast has been laid out. Fruit and roots and berries have all been gathered, but no meat lies waiting. "Tell me, why of all the troubles of Creation it is the Wyld that wears on your mind?"

Ryushi recounts his tale carefully, speaking from the moments after his Exaltation to his rescue of Alissa's painting. He leaves nothing out; let this Lunar find of his temporary alliance with Cynis Megara, for she will know eventually. At last he finishes recounting the tale. "I am a king without a kingdom. I've been given a vision by the sword and I have followed it. That is all."

"Already you awaken in the Usurpers their feelings of duty and remind them of honor," says Eliara sadly. "We could never do this." She repays his honesty with honesty. Her tale is not brief, and Ryushi eats twice before it at last ends. In that time, she has told him of the fall of the Realm, of the Lunars fleeing instead of devoting themselves to their estranged allies and lovers. The story of battles is kept short. She has no interest in every motion in the great play of powers. In the end, Ryushi knows that she came here to escape the pressures of the world and to meditate and wait for a sign from Luna. "I left my followers to themselves. It was as much for their own good as for my own peace. They were being spent bitterly in the battles of my kind, and soon all they would have is the memory of honor."

Ryushi digests all this. He is not angered at the betrayal of the Lunars, nor the Sidereals, nor even the Dragon-Blooded. In his mind, the Mandate of Heaven withdrew itself long before the overthrow, and this thought alone gives him cold comfort: for how could the world fail to honor Heaven's wish for change for so long?

"Now you are back and alive, and I smell the world changing," says Eliara. "Perhaps it is time for me to leave the east and return to the waking world." She lets out a soft sigh, "I have wondered for some time what might rouse me again. If the appearance of a Lawgiver does not manage it, nothing will. It is unlikely Luna will trouble herself over a wayward daughter."

"You must decide for yourself whether the Solars are enough. We are young and unpracticed," Ryushi answers, frankly. "I trust your wisdom in this. But if you turn me away, I will go to another."

"No, it is time for me to see the world again." The Lunar rises smoothly. "Take me away from this place, child. Show me the world as it is, and tell me of the world as it should be, for the wisdom I have is sad and bereft of young dreams. It falls to you to light the fires that will rekindle the world."

With the retrieval of some of Eliara's possessions, the pair make for the _Sun's Messenger_. Ryushi explains what he can think of as he goes, answering the Lunar's rather piercing questions honestly. En route they encounter spiderwebs strung through some of the trees. Some webs have prayer strips stuck onto them - the worship of the remaining children of the Lunar, or an isolated pocket of forest-people. Others have offerings of nuts and other bounty from the jungle. And one has the body of a Wyld-tainted poacher, caught mid-feast with a rictus of terror written on his dead face. "Farewell gifts," Ryu murmurs.
