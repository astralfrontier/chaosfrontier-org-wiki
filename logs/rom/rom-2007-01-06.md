# Rise of Madness 2007-01-06

In an operation as absurd and ridiculous as breaking-into Sion, everything must go perfectly. Oddly, when it does, it almost seems too easy. Megara and Maragal pull off their roles smoothly, meeting a rather tight-lipped Monk named Spring Storm and within a few minutes disarming the suspicion. After this, their names are likely to be worthless, but for the two Dragon Bloods it seems a worthy cause. Since they started travelling with the Solars, their prowess has grown in leaps and bounds. They are not chosen of the Sun, but they have the confidence of those who carry his mandate.

Tanuki is accustomed to the art of disguise - although never before has he achieved such exquisite perfection. He's even used to playing the servant, having used such a role before in lesser heists. That he plays his own role perfectly is completely unexceptional, since no one notices the entourage unless they do something to stand out. He is searched, of course, but a few basic tools of the trade are easy to conceal as something else, and indeed are the result of centuries of design for that purpose: a strangling cord, for example, can be woven into his garments, easy to tear free, but unremarkable otherwise, and his jockstrap is tougher than is probably needed for its apparent purpose but quite strong enough to be used as a sling.

Spring Storm leads Cynis Megara and her entourage through the outer halls. Things seem quiet, almost too quiet, and perhaps they are. The Wyld Hunt's resources have suffered since the disappearance of the Empress, and an increase in disturbance outside the Realm have taken its attention. This has not diminished the guard, but it _has_ had an impact further down the pay scale - Megara notices that there are fewer flunkies and gofers than there ought to be.

This is no great concern to Tanuki, as there are still far more than enough servants for the plan to work. The plan of waiting for a signal from Megara is scotched as she and Maragal are led into a meeting hall, but on the other hand, this gives the ideal opportunity, as the news Megara brings is deemed too sensitive for her entourage to hear, and they are stationed outside. Tanuki need only wait for the hallway to be clear for a few moments before making a mumbled excuse and slipping away.

A quick slip down the hall, and Tanuki quickly inverts his clothing, getting rid of some excess ornamentation and leaving himself to look for all the world like another lowly functionary within Sion. The strangling cord and sling are secreted in a pocket, and some of the ornamental studs of the original outfit ripped free to use as impromptu sling bullets, in case they become necessary.

It is a long walk from the meeting halls to the archives, and more of Tanuki's skills will be required to make the entire journey. For now, Tanuki need only look like he belongs. This is not hard - it only requires maintaining a purposeful stride, averting his gaze respectfully from any of higher rank while blankly looking past anyone wearing the same garb as himself. A haughty dismissal would be appropriate to anyone subordinate to him if there were any, but Tanuki decided that the maximum possible complement of functionaries should resemble him, that his unfamiliar face go unremarked. Just in case, Tanuki also wraps Essence around himself, encouraging everyone who sees him to assume that he is who he appears to be: a servant on someone else's errand.

The outer areas Tanuki finds easy to move through. If anything, his presence makes other servants nervous. This makes sense, when one considers Maragal's suggestions. They think Tanuki is testing them, brought here to hunt for spies. Even being suspected of showing an 'unnatural interest' in things could lead to the dismissal of someone from Sion. With their lives bound to this place, dismissal is far more than a financial problem.

The rather confusing map that Maragal was able to create for Tanuki shows him the most likely routes in to the secret records. As Tanuki approaches a hallway, he knows that soon he will be moving into areas where common servants do not go. The cloak of anonymity will not suit him. As if to drive this point home, he catches a pair of Dragon Blooded monks walking out past him. They are so lost in their conversation that they do not notice him. It is not likely he will have that luck below.

After a time, Tanuki finds the passage to the next area. As Megara warned him, the doorway is locked, and smuggling lockpicks into the place was more than Tanuki felt prepared to do. Fortunately, he did not need to. He draws a single thread from his robe, and the Caste Mark on his forehead flickers briefly as he charges it with Essence. The absence of guards is fortunate, for this act would raise red flags to anyone, Dragon-Blooded or mortal, who observed him doing this; but it need only last a moment, as he slips the empowered thread into the doorjamb. It stiffens beneath his fingers, and he can feel the tumblers of the lock as easily as if he were touching them with his bare fingers as he turns the barrel.

The door swings open slowly, and Tanuki is able to slip into the archives. It is here that he figures out a somewhat unexpected defensive measure. After he slips down a hallway he finds that the records are kept in many identical rooms. None of filing cabinets are labelled. It seems that the only ones who know where to find things are the librarians. According to Megara, those librarians are ancient monks with remarkable pasts. Still, the sorceress was not without any advice. She was able to give Tanuki the guide numbers. They indicate three different rooms as normal storage locations for anathema data.

Tanuki was not expecting to have an easy time of finding the records. Not being an astute student of Old Realm, even if there had been an indexing system, it would have been, to him, nearly as unapproachable as the archivists. Of course, a lowly floor servant would have been unlikely to get the archivists to tell him anything. The guide numbers will be of some help, but Tanuki has another thing to try before simply opening every drawer in sight...

Megara and Maragal's report, after all, concerns matters of interest to the Wyld Hunt. And it must necessarily include an edited version of Ryushi's exploits, as the Wyld Hunt would have had independent reports on that spectacular display, and it would look odd if they left it out. So... a new report on the Anathema may well be about to be filed. Therefore, Tanuki's plan is simply to wait for an archivist to deliver a new report, avoiding their notice, and start his search with the cabinets they used.

In the meantime, Tanuki has to avoid the regular foot traffic in the library. As sparse as it is, he has plenty of time to find a good place to lurk - and one with good visibility of the front door. In this, he is guided by one of the first principles of the burglar: no one ever looks up. The ceiling is not overly ornamented here, but neither is it constructed to defeat handholds and footholds. Which means that someone as nimble as Tanuki has no problem finding himself a place to brace himself on the ceiling as he maintains his vigil.

Tanuki's ceiling perch works like a charm, so to speak, and he is able to observe the occasional comings and goings of the archivists until he sees one head toward one of the rooms Megara indicated in her notes. He drops to the floor as lightly as a feather, and follows behind, timing his steps to exactly match those of the librarian; the hard walls and floors of the archive wing echo in any case, and Tanuki's footsteps are but another echo. And as the librarian passes between the file cabinets, Tanuki leaps up onto one with but the slightest sound, and creeps along the top of the file cabinets, keeping the top of the librarian's head in sight until he reaches his destination.

As soon as the librarian departs, Tanuki drops down and begins rifling the cabinet. His search is lengthy, though methodical, as he fails to recognize most of the writing - and just in case, he uses a small wineskin of oil to grease the rails of every file cabinet as he opens them, so that he can close the cabinets in a hurry at the sound of footsteps. A precaution that helps him at least twice before he finally sees the Old Realm word for 'Lunar'...

Several dozen reports later, Tanuki hits pay dirt. Several pages with military-looking insignia, and the prominent words 'Anathema', 'Moon', and 'Threat Report' - accompanied by several lines of scrawled information, and most importantly, a sequence of numbers and symbols that Megara taught him are indicative of map references. He slips this folder underneath his tunic, then darts up onto the cabinets again as another librarian comes in the entrance. This provides him the opportunity he needs - as the librarian departs, Tanuki tries a new tack: he invokes the Spider-Foot Style and shadows the librarian's footsteps on the ceiling until he leaves. This proves to be fortunate, as another librarian opens the door just before the first departs, and passes beneath Tanuki as the Night Caste quickly clings to a ceiling fixture, breathing a silent sigh of relief.

This leaves Tanuki only one problem: how to get out of Sion. Finally - a task that doesn't require subtlety and sneaking, although a little bit of it helps. His plan here is the simplest of all: walk straight out as if he weren't doing anything unusual, and then run like the hounds of Malfeas were chasing him at the 'Hey' in 'Hey you!' No stealth is needed here - just the presence to act perfectly normal. And in retrospect, Tanuki really shouldn't have tried to make eye contact to see how it was going.

Even before Tanuki gets between them, the guards call out, and step forward, trying to lay hands on him. With an oath, the Night Caste infuses his body with Essence, and the guards lay hands on thin air. One of the guards' mailed fists smashes into the alarm globe, triggering a spell that sets the glowglobes to flashing red; it is under their luminescence that Tanuki flees the stronghold of the Wyld Hunt, his anima progressively flaring as he avoids the grasp of the guards, the hail of arrow fire, and in one close call, even evades the lightning-fast kick of an Immaculate monk.

By the time Tanuki reaches the gates, his anima banner is glowing like a fallen star - and the Immaculate who was inches away from catching up with Tanuki is brought short by a burst of lightning from the blue sky. It is the _Sun's Messenger_, which swoops down from the sky at breakneck speed, and even Tanuki's incredible reflexes barely manage to catch the trailing dragline before the airship climbs into the air once more.

Maragal's armored hand catches hold of Tanuki's wrist, hauling him in with a smirk. The man looks somewhat the worse for wear. Megara is settled in a chair, one bloodied arm set limply in her lap. "I don't think we're going to be able to use our names in the Realm anymore," says Maragal. At the sight of Tanuki, Megara lets out a deep sigh. "I should have known you'd get out without so much as a scratch," she says, sounding more than a little irritated.

Tanuki looks at Megara, his eyes rolling a little. "Wha?" he asks, his speech slightly slurred. "I can' hear you quite right - I think tha' monk almos' hit me." He shakes his head as if to clear it, and grins. "Next time, I'll hafta do a lil' better. He won't lay a hand on me, I guarantee it." And with that, he slumps bonelessly into one of the seats, holding the file aloft triumphantly.

Megara grumbles at Tanuki, but whatever she's saying, it's not meant to be heard. Well, at least not in its entirety. From what Tanuki catches, it seems she has a most impressive grasp of foul language. Maragal settles himself in a chair and lets out a sigh. "I just hope that it has what Lord Ryushi needs. If we have to try again, we'd need to level the whole place, and I'm thinking they'd hunt us down for that one, even with a war among the Great Houses."

Tanuki shakes his head. "I think there may be altern... atler... other ways." He turns his hand from side to side. "I'm only jus' beginnin' to learn what I can do."

"Well, knowing the way the hunt is, we're already going to get far more attention than we want," says Megara. "Seems they were on to us from the first. They wanted us to be recalled to Cynus to answer some questions. That little worm at the Heptagram gave our descriptions and we're suspected of.. well, what we are guilty of, I suppose."

Tanuki slumps into his chair. "Guess we're takin' the long way home, then," he says, his eyes half-closing.

"I can outrun anything they send after us," says Meggan. Tanuki feels a powerful sensation of movement, and for a while his body is flattened against his chair. Maragal mutters out a most unlikely oath, and Megara tightens her lips. The pressure slowly decreases, and when Tanuki looks out, he will see the sea and land rushing by in a crazy blur. Whatever speed the Sun's Messenger had shown before was nothing compared to this.
