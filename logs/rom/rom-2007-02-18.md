As the Sidereal charges, a few things become clear. One, there is a wrapping construct of essence that sheathes him, and two, he moves with truly supernatural speed and grace. There is no hesitation as battle is closed with the Dawn Caste, the fight simply begins as it must. In the distance, the fleet can be seen, closing formation and moving to cut off any escape that Wavecutter might conceive.

With the lightning speed the Sidereal darts aside, a single skillful attack is levelled against Ryushi. The blow seems to reach across the distance that separates the Dawn from his attacker without bothering with the intervening space.

Wheeling Daoyang with all the lightness of a slender river reed, Ryushi knocks away the unseen attack. He twists to the side, aware of the Essence of the thing even if he cannot see a blade or arrow or fist to dart from - now he is seeing with his inner eye, dueling with his Essence against that of his opponent, carrying the fight past the physical and onto the spiritual plane. A ringing sound from his sword tells the tale of his attempt at defense, and the beach sand kicks up as his feet slide into their new position.

The Sidereal moves like a strange wind, showing no sign of disappointment or pleasure at the movements of the Dawn Caste. His next attack comes no less quickly, two swift flicks of the blade, driving more attacks against his most immediate foe.

Ryushi rushes forward. Again Daoyang moves like lightning. Again the alloyed orichalcum weapon peals its martial tone, the sound the Realm's House of Bells was named for. The winds from the northern sea whip across his face, sending his hair flowing out behind him. He narrows his eyes, focusing them on his enigmatic opponent, willing his very being to move faster, willing his blade to find its mark when he arrives.

The Dawn Caste's rage is genuine. Right now he must escape with what's on those ships - he _must_. Alissa depends on it. Perhaps Creation does too. And now this Exalt is obstructing him. He'll waste as little time as he must. Daoyang begins to glow, channeling his furious Essence and manifesting it as a coruscant aura of devastation.

The fight between Dawn and Sidereal flows like a dance, the speed of it breathtaking. The noise of one parry can be heard only after the third attack is delivered. For a moment, the Exalts can feel fate twisting about them, the block just hard enough, the angle precisely right so that the very power of the Dawn's blow sends Daoyang rushing through the air. Time seems to stand still as the blade soars through the air and again the very web of destiny seems to reveal itself as Eliara's monstrous hand seizes the weapon and with impossible accuracy hurls it back at Ryushi in a trail of golden sparks, where it lands precisely in his grip.

The Lunar hesitates for a moment, looking puzzled. She mutters softly, "Winds within winds.." She moves on quickly, however, and she races away from this battle, down to the waiting ship below where the might of the Sapphire Circle might teach a few stupid children in their boats who holds the real power in Creation.

Tanuki narrows his eyes, as Ryushi and the mysterious attacker clash with one another. Only his Exaltation gives him the faintest notion of what is happening there - but at the very least, he can see that the shadowy figure is a serious threat even to Ryushi. His best hope - his _only_ hope - is that the being has not seen him yet. Slipping a pair of lead pebbles into Silent Rain, Tanuki focuses his will, his determination to save his friend... and lets fly two shots, using his own nascent understanding of Essence to find the precise points which will most cripple the enemy.

The Sidereal is taken utterly by surprise. Only when the two shots tear through the tendons at the back of his legs does he realize he's facing two foes. Hobbling, but still far from out of the fight, the old man narrows his eyes, a smouldering fury building within them.

Feeling that fate is moving against him drives the Sidereal to strike more anxiously, three fast slices delivered against the Dawn Caste. To the eyes of Ryushi, however, the loss of coordination speaks volumes.

The flawless defense Ryushi maintains has not faltered or wavered an inch. His dedication to winning this fight empowers him. The wind whistling around his body, singing along the blade of his daiklave, stinging his eyes with the salt-spray of the northern ocean, the fires which will consume what's left of the Heptagram - the elements are in fury, yet he ignores them. He knocks aside the Sidereal's attacks like leaves before a storm, dancing and moving about to maintain his engagement with his challenger.

Despite everything, despite his proficiency in the martial arts, and despite his formidable mastery of Essence, Daoyang tears into the Sidereal. Only fate, or perhaps just luck, prevents it from being a slaughter. Nevertheless the golden weapon comes away red with blood.

Tanuki grins ferally - the hand of the Night has laid itself upon the foe, and although his defenses are still unearthly - even Tanuki's heightened senses can barely see what is happening - Ryushi's supernal abilities are enough to break through them. ...Perhaps there is still more he, Tanuki, can do? With his Caste Mark now glimmering on his brow, the chance to hide is lost, but perhaps sheer force will suffice where surprise will not. As he draws his Essence around himself, he bursts into a tower of violet flame, using all his divine talent to propel the sling-stone through all the Sidereal's uncanny abilities.

The Sidereal's reliance on the power of his protection is catching up with him. The lead digs into the back of his shoulder and he grimaces in pain. The blade he wields still is held ready, his stance unwavering, though he is far less than what he was. The bite of Tanuki's attacks is telling, and destiny seems to care little for this one, foolish child. Again he attacks, this time holding back, so that only one slice is directed at the Dawn. Surely even a Solar must tire eventually!

Having used his Essence to attack, Ryushi is still reeling from the magical wave of hostile force that propelled his sword to dizzying heights of ferocity. Nevertheless he is still one of the supreme swordsmen of Creation by mortal terms, and more than that besides - he is dedicated to victory. Daoyang is his ally, moving as he commands, and his eyes and ears and internal sense of self guide his arms to intercept the Sidereal's strike.

Badly wounded by even a single attack, the warrior becomes mindful of his defense and aware of the wisdom of Solar Essence in combating his fellow Celestial. He focuses his entire being on a single, unavoidable attack, putting the full force of his will behind it and guiding his aim at the elusive, if wounded, Sidereal.

In the swift rush of seconds, the Solars can catch glimpses of activity below. It seems that Eliara has reached Wavecutter as all manner of activity begins, prepping the ship for war. Along its decks the sailors move wildly, aided by a flowing mass of automata. Whether for war or not, a flood of silver and gold is rushing from the ship over the side where it plunges into the waters below. The keen sight of the Solars can just barely make out the racing streaks of automata on the sea floor, masses of them dividing swiftly.

The Sidereal continues his methodical assault on the Dawn, moving farther out still, his attention too focused on the battle with his formidible opponent to hunt for any cover. His blade lashes out in a fast slash as he probes the defenses of his enemy once more.

The wounded warrior realizes something, as he again channels Essence into an impenetrable defense: he need not kill the Sidereal. He need only survive the destruction of the Heptagram and ensure the escape of the fleet. He changes tactics, spreading his feet out and lowering his body slightly into a defensive stance. Daoyang is held before him, moving with the swiftness and power of a hurricane to fend off the formidable attacks.

It is never wise for the sniper to stay in one place once he has taken his shot - even if the target has no backup, he may eventually be able to return the favor. The amethyst bonfire that is Tanuki darts nimbly from one building to the next, balancing on cornices, watching the battle for another opening. And then, as Tanuki runs along the edge of a rooftop, the shadowy figure deals Ryushi a crippling blow. "Nooo!" cries the Dagger of Heaven, and the glowing bonfire coalesces into Tanuki's totem animal as he sends another pellet of lead rocketing into the night.

The attack from Tanuki rakes over the Sidereal, lifting him off his feet. Only his essence-granted agility allows him to find his feet again. In one even motion he lands and springs, moving with great haste towards the foe that he now knows will kill him before long. Tanuki is his target, and the speed of the Sidereal is directed to take the battle to him.

Heedless of his own life, Ryushi now speaks to himself, and to his weapon, in his heart. "I trust you, my ally. I put my life in your hands. You must succeed." And he rushes the Sidereal, now focused on Tanuki, drawing Essence into himself. He has spent the motes of power under his command; now he draws on the pillar of Essence that swarms around his body, igniting it into a pyreflame of menace and channeling it into the golden blade. He will strike, and strike well, for he must succeed.

In a final act of purest spite, the Sidereal reaches out, grappling at the essence that courses through him in one final, blinding burst. To the eyes of the Sidereal, everything is a weaving, infinitely complex, but almost sensible. He watches as bit by bit his very spirit is unravelled, he feels the spark about to escape, and in that final moment, he redirects a fraction of his enemy's power.

Ryushi slumps down, holding himself up with one hand on Daoyang. The blade is buried in the earth, and wobbles slightly as Ryushi breathes. He lives, still.

The force of the Sidereal's dying blow is unseeable by any mortal eyes, and only dimly perceived even by Tanuki, but its force is enough to disrupt even his perfect balance for a moment, and he goes tumbling from the roof, landing in the alley beyond in a three-point stance, bruises blossoming on his body even below his armor. "Ooo, that stings," he mutters under his breath as he emerges from behind the alley to see, to his relief, Ryushi standing over his fallen foe.

Before the wounded Exalts the very ground turns red with blood, the liquid spreading out in an unnatural pool. From its midst the form of a young maiden rises, her eyes and hair both a blazing, terrible red. In her left hand is a spear that drips blood of the slain Primordials. With her right she snares from the corpse of the Sidereal his heart, and with a blast of her breath it crumbles to dust, revealing only the glow of a spark of essence, the vision of it beautiful beyond description.

The Maiden of Battles has loomed over Ryushi's shoulder for a long time. He does not startle at recognition. He simply sighs, breathing and feeling the Essence of the world mingle with his own.

Tanuki was hardly in a wisecracking mood in any case, after he and Ryushi had fought so hard for their lives. And now, in the presence of a being whose name he knows in his soul, any smart remarks he may yet have had die on his lips. He leans against the side of the building, and simply stares.

Finally the warrior has drawn breath enough to speak through his pain. "Tell the next ones this," he says. "He fought well. But it's a waste for him to have died well."

Mars draws in another breath and lets it out in a gentle blast of warm air. The spark glides from her fingers slowly at first, then rushes off with the speed of a shooting star. The words of Ryushi draw the red eyes of Mars, but she says nothing in response to it. Instead, she draws out two slender scrolls. One she throws over her shoulder, where it spins towards Tanuki, the other she tucks into Ryushi's belt. "If you win the next battle, you will do well to accept the gift of the Eldest Maiden." The maiden waits a moment and notes, "I dislike delivering messages for anyone. The fall of this one shall communicate for you well enough." The Maiden of Battles descends back into the blood of the fallen. Before she vanishes completely her laughter can be heard and she murmurs, "It's so good to be back.."

Ryushi hefts Daoyang over his shoulder. He begins sprinting toward the dock, where Wavecutter's ship and Eliara are waiting. He pours Essence into his anima banner, flaring brightly for all to see - and hoping Meggan has turned her eyes toward the battle of the Celestials.

Tanuki keeps pace with Ryushi, despite his own bruises - his own anima banner already forming a violet counterpoint to Ryushi's golden aura. "Think I should go down an' get Meggan?" he asks, as they run.

"We'll need her to stop the fleet," Ryu answers, breathing heavily as he runs. Already his injuries are healing themselves, though the damage remains. As a solder of the gods, he is prepared for such punishment.

The words are barely out of Ryushi's mouth when the water near the foremost enemy ship erupts. The Sun's Messenger explodes through the very midst of the proud battleship, the skilled work of mortals is no match for the powerful skin that the Ancient Solars made. With a flick of the ship's great tail Meggan sends a ball of scalding essence into the mast of a ship three hundred yards away. Her path is direct, she's bearing right towards Ryushi and Tanuki, screaming lick a rocket as she scythes through the air.

Ryushi sprints across the island and onto the wharf. He charges himself up with Essence, leaping straight into the air and onto the path of the oncoming airship. Daoyang is ready in his grip, a glowing weapon ready to lay waste to the Navy of the Realm.

"Now that's somethin else," Tanuki remarks as the golden airship splinters its way through the Realm warship. And as the airship soars overhead, he leaps to catch the very tip of the trailing rope as it screams past.

The _Sun's Messenger_ turns in a tight arc and screams back toward the Realm's Navy. Ryushi shouts some orders to Meggan, and leaps over the side of the airship. His target is the first Realm ship in the line.

He sails through the air unsupported, Daoyang held out beside him. He skims a few scant yards above the rail, a speeding missile that startles the sailors working on the top deck. The daiklave cleanly severs the mast, and Ryushi hurtles over the other side and toward the icy ocean water.

He severs a rope and grabs hold of it at the last moment, whipping himself back into the air and back up toward the waiting airship. Already its cannon is preparing to blast the next vessel in line.

Tanuki meanwhile makes a beeline for the weapon controls, buckling his hands into the harness. If the _Messenger's_ energy weapon was deadly under Meggan's control, it is the very fist of the Sun in Tanuki's. A single blast is sent arcing on a curving course, severing two masts in one blow and passing close enough to a third ship to set the sails aflame; another ship that begins to turn to attack Wavecutter's vessel finds itself with flaming wreckage for a rudder... soon, ships begin to turn aside if the _Messenger's_ tail even points in their direction.

As the Solars shred Realm ships with grace and ease, the No Moon's furious thirst for vengeance is sated in a far more horrible manner. The great Lunar leaps from the surface of Wavecutter's ship and races on the surface of the water as easily as if it were firm sand. The fire of essence cannons rains down around her, sending an enormous column of water airbourne before her. Through that terrible mist Eliara comes on, no longer in the form of her totem, but now as the titanic form of a Tyrant Lizard.

The first ship she meets is thrown into a panic when the great beast leaps aboard. The first dragon blood that stands in the path of Eliara is swallowed whole. As the crew leaps overboard, the No Moon rams her way through their mast. There is little room for mercy. The unfortunate Dragon Blood captain that strains to swim away is plucked from the water and shaken to death without hesitation.

Between them, the three Celestials and their companion have the ferocity, firepower, and determination to wipe the Navy out - or at least cripple its ability to interfere with Wavecutter's escape. Planks of wood, half-drowned sailors, burning wreckage, and the occasional jade trinket (prior to sinking) are left in their wake. The wind is good to Wavecutter, and no further obstacles seem to stand in the pirate fleet's way.

Unlike most rumor mills, the tales of the spirits the Lunars use to listen to current events need not exaggerate or lie. Still, they long for big news nonetheless. So when word comes of battle in the Realm, they are eager to bear witness, very far do they carry what they see, reporting even here, in a dark, chilly cave to a terrible mixture of goat and man whose very name sends terror in the hearts of his enemies. The sharp eyed Ma-Ha-Suchi grins as the tale unravels, his fist clenching in excitement.

The wind blew warm that day over the Heptagram, and as the Solars and their allies sailed smoothly through the wreckage of their foe they turned back, guided by the perfect timing of the Sun.

The placement of every speck of firedust was guided perfectly. Support columns were painstakingly tilted or reinforced as was needed. The end result was a marvel to behold, as the entirety of the Heptagram burst like a powderkeg, the tiles of the roof landing not far from Wavecutter's ship, and guided by strange fate, the book 'Heresies of the Solars' fell upon the deck of that ship. The wind caught it there and opened it and before the eyes of the crew, the light of the Unconquered Sun burnt it to a cinder.

Throughout the tale the mirth of Ma-Ha-Suchi spills out in roars of laughter. "Yes! Yes! YES!!" He slams his fist down upon the carved stone of his throne, shattering it. The great Lunar rises and strides out of his cave and his bellowing voice carries over the camp of his war chiefs. "WE STRIKE! THE REALM DIES!"

---

Far south of there, where even the shouts of Ma-Ha-Suchi cannot yet reach, Eliara and Ami spread out the collosal spoils of war. Wavecutter (who had to be pried from her ship) watches with some interest as a treasure trove of jade, orichalcum, moon silver, and star metal is spread out. Nearby, Ami's automata carefully sort the books of lore that were recovered from the Heptagram.

Eliara notes casually, "You know the Sidereals are going to be floored by this. Even those who are favoring your return are not eager to let you have this strong a hand." The No Moon laughs to herself, "Yes, I bet those yammering fools are going to spend the next few days in non-stop committee meetings."
