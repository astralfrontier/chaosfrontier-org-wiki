# Rise of Madness 2007-03-10

Eliara is not eager to do what she has agreed to. However, she would not take back her words, either. This is why Ryushi and Tanuki find themselves standing with her a few leagues from the city, standing on a mountainside in the dead of the night. The moon hangs above, it's southern tip an ominous blood red. "Luna bleeds," Eliara intones gently.

Those are the last words the exalts will hear from the Lunar for some time. The weaving of the portal is a laborious process, and even Ryushi finds it difficult to follow the myriad patterns. The presence of essence that the Solars have grown accustomed to is not increased here, but is somehow more overt, as if it were a thing they might reach out and touch directly.

Pieces of the gateway are assembled with care, and as the portal to Yu-Shan nears completion the Solars are both drawn back to visions of the past, when such a ritual was surrounded with fanfare and countless crowds would gather to sanctify such a journey. Now there is only silence when the dark portal is ready.

Eliara seems uncomfortable, looking at her work with pursed lips. She says nothing, stepping aside and gesturing for Ryushi to go first into the eternal city of Yu-Shan.

Ryushi readies himself. His swords are sheathed at his belt, but the blade he draws to confront the coming battle rests only in his mind. He has received fragments of understanding from his dreams and visions, even if they are teasingly indistinct. He has seen what Ami is capable of and he has heard of the old stories. The geographic teaching crystals from the long-lost Solar isle have shown that the world was larger once. He knows that is due to the power of the Solars, and they alone. It is this knowledge which forges the weapon of his wits, the weapon with which he will duel the masters of fate and the changing beast-men.

Now he steps forward, prepared to confront this new challenge, and to face Heaven itself.

The stride from Creation to Yu-Shan was once like the caress of a lover, warm and comforting. Somehow the Exalts know this. Now, it is like walking down a quaking hallway, so disorienting that it challenges the travellers to keep to their feet when they reach the other side.

What greets the Solars and their Lunar guide is darkness. It is so dark, in fact, that they cannot see a thing until Eliara calls upon her anima banner and floods the area with silver light. Even then there is a darkness that seems to devour this brilliance, so that all that can be revealed is a sphere perhaps ten strides long, and past that blackness like a wall.

Inside that area, the visions are far from pleasant. Yu-Shan no longer sparkles. It's lovely pathways of many colors are faded and many stones are broken, so that footing is treacherous. By some fortune it seems that the only thing not decaying is a small plaque that rests upon a cracked column. Eliara looks over it and says, "We stand now at the southern edge of the Great Square. The Fountain of Venus should not be far from us now." Though the Lunar is brave and has seen many horrors, there is a wavering in her voice at the state of Yu-Shan.

Ryushi was not prepared for what he sees, and he follows behind the Lunar in shocked silence. His ideas of an ordered Celestial realm are being shattered, and slowly he realizes that they are being replaced with another concept - that the mandate of Heaven comes not from a place, but the practice of virtue. Such a thing terrifies him; if virtue is lost, then so is the world.

Tanuki shakes his head. "This is Heaven?" he murmurs, under his breath, drawing the cowl of his armor over his head, as if preparing to fade into the shadows himself will make him more comfortable with the darkness around him. It doesn't work.

Eliara has no answers, and it is clear it takes her much strength to go on. She makes her way through the square carefully. Finally the very farthest reaches of her light catches the lip of a fountain. She gestures for the others to stay close and leans over to admire the water. Her gasp speaks volumes. An oily slick veils the perfect beauty of the Fountain of Venus. Even the water the fountain casts on high has an unclean look to it, and when it falls into the pool the noise is deadened, as if the ears of the Exalts were stuffed with cotton. "How can any of us still live?" Eliara's words are lifeless, her emotions carefully blocked.

Ryushi shakes his head slowly. He has very little he cares to say now, for it is becoming clearer and clearer what he must do.

Tanuki thinks back to the battle to the death outside the smoldering ruins of the Heptagram. "The Sidereals know 'bout this, an' they still fight us?" he asks.

"Perhaps they believe that with us alive, it would become even worse," muses Ryu darkly.

It is Tanuki's turn to shake his head in bemused silence.

A soft, wet sound draws Eliara's lips tightly shut. She moves about the fountain swiftly, forcing the Solars to move alone or be left in the darkness. "Stay back!" she orders, raising a hand and slowly moving towards what seems like a woman sprawled out upon her side. Her chest rises and falls swiftly, and her eyes flutter open and closed. Before Eliara is able to place a hand on her, she arches her back and a high, soft scream comes from her. In strands of light her form is torn asunder. With a sharp clink a red gem that the woman wore falls to the ground. It is all that remains.

Outside the sphere of light, there is the noise of rushing motion. "You are sure she went this way?" "Hurry!" "This is terrible!" "When will they do something?" "Our bureau simply can't keep up like this!" "Those fools! They never-" "Oh no! Oh no!" "We're too late? Not again!" Three young people reach the light at the same time, nearly stumbling over each other. "Who are you?" demands one of them, a young man with green hair and dark, brown eyes. "She's gone," murmurs another, a woman so young as to almost appear a child. The third, an old man crosses his arms and frowns at the Exalts. All of them wear robes with golden trim. To Tanuki, it seems a strange mix of facts. The robes were inredibly rich once, but now they appear worn and moth eaten.

Ryushi steps forward. This is his goal; he chooses to address the group. "We are Chosen of the Sun and Moon. We come to speak to the Chosen of the Stars."

"You have found them," replies the old man. "I am Sim'r Li of the Convention of Water." He seems unsure just how to greet these guests. The young man is little help. "I am Jason, also of the Convention of Water." The two men look to each other, their hands moving in a side conversation of some kind. "Welcome to Yu-Shan, Chosen Ones, I am Lydia dal Syl. I am the head of the Convention of Water. It has been a very long time since we have seen your kinds in Yu-Shan. Please forgive my young friends." The voice that comes from that childlike face is mature and as deep as the great oceans themselves. "I am Chosen of Serenity, and I have been waiting for you for a very long time."

"One of your kind came to kill us. We've buried him respectfully," Ryushi answers. "I came to talk."

"Yes, and I really must thank you for that," replies Lydia. "Of course, at least some of the credit for our victory must go to a few friends among our number. It was no small battle that led to his foolish behavior." She lets out a soft sigh, "Thanks to your work, Solar, we have gained a vote. They cannot carry over us. For now." She looks about herself with a sigh, "But enough of this, I welcome you to Yu-Shan." Her right hand is raised above her, and essence pours from about her in waves. In all directions, light springs to life, shattering the illusion. The noise of the Fountain comes in a lovely song, the stones at the feet of the solars are more wondrous than the greatest works in Creation. Only one thing remains the same. The red gem. Lydia bends down to collect it, and with a sad sigh she holds it to her chest. "This is Yu-Shan."

Ryushi frowns. "I wish to have the audience of enough of you to make a case. I wish to also speak to the Lunar Exalted. Send a delegation to the designated place and time, and I will be satisfied. Will you do this?"

"I can try to arrange it," replies Lydia. "We are poorly staffed, and I fear that the Convention of the West has little chance of swaying anyone. Still, knowing what you have done will make them take the message more seriously."

The warrior nods. "I leave this to you then, with my thanks." He withdraws a scroll from his sleeve and extends it in offering; the place and the hour are written thereon.

Lydia accepts the scroll, and in the same gesture presses the red stone into Ryushi's hand. "You must do this for me. Give her life again, Solar. Leave your little meeting to me."

Ryushi examines the stone with a dubious expression. "What is it I must do?"

"I'm sure you will figure it out," replies Lydia. "Just as I must somehow figure out how to get a missive heard when my Convention is on such poor footing."

"If I must speak to them directly, then so be it," Ryu suggests. "Still, I will do this thing. It is not seemly to let the gods die before your eyes and do nothing."

Lydia sighs softly, "Were our positions reversed, I do not know if you could do better, Solar." Sim'r Li narrows his eyes, "You seem to think it our wish to be bound as we are? The entire Western Convention's Sidereal Representation stands before you. One by one the islands of the West are consumed by the Wyld, and time after time the councils of the wise ignore our plea for aid." Yet his words are nothing compared to the disgust of the young Jason. "You mock us, Solar! Lydia has just lost her-" He finishes in a sputter, knowing he has said too much.

"I have lost my wife," says Lydia. "It is true." The other Sidereals look extremely uncomfortable. "That is a violation of the Law," Eliara notes quietly, instructing the Solars as best she can. "It doesn't matter, now," answers Lydia.

Ryushi's face loses some of its hardness, and he adopts a somber smile. "Well then. I think you will be pleased to hear the message I have for you. Come and attend." He beckons to Eliara and Tanuki, clearly intending to leave.

Tanuki is grateful that the mask hides his expression, as he does not trust his own feelings for now. He simply bows to the Sidereals, letting his body language convey as much respect as he can muster, before falling in behind Ryushi.

Lydia smiles, but knows it is far from likely. The West is disgraced and powerless. Her hands are both raised in sign of farewell and blessing. It is an ancient symbol from a people long lost to the Wyld, and yet Ryushi senses its meaning clearly. It is the farewell and prayer of a trusted friend who hopes against hope for the return of a warrior going to battle.

---

Ryushi asks Eliara about the gem, and about the death and life of a god. The No Moon is no more forthcoming than her Sidereal counterpart, and for good reason - she cannot tell what she does not know. Resolving that this, the home of the gods, is the most proper place to find the lore of the gods, Ryushi changes tactics: "Who is the wisest of the gods that we can speak to here?"

"I am not sure there is any one answer to that question. The wisest of warriors is Victory, the wisest of healers is Remedy, and the wisest of Scholars is Lore." Eliara looks to Ryushi with some doubt in her expression, "You do realize that one doesn't simply march up to the pavilion of a god and knock like an old friend, of course."

Ryushi thinks back, reflecting on what he has learned about himself and about the Solars. "The light of the Sun that burns in me now, and the sparkling sunbeam amidst the shadows that Tanuki holds... These powers were held by other men and women before us. We remember bits and pieces of their lives, yes?" he asks.

"That is true. They call them Sparks," replies Eliara. "They retain some of the gifts and knowledge of those who came before. You have certainly noticed that you know things from time to time that you've never learned."

Ryushi nods. "Then one such as I can certainly meet the wisest of warriors as an old friend, just as you say." He smiles. "Take us to Victory."

Eliara arches an eyebrow and tries not to laugh. She is somewhat successful. "In any case, this should be amusing. I'm bringing the distant heir of a great warrior to Victory." With the illusion of Yu-Shan banished, she strolls along the wide walkways more easily. Still, not all the decay is false. Most buildings stand open, their tiles showing wear. The flaws are subtle, but they are real, and to Eliara, worrying enough that her mirth is short-lived.

Victory can be found in one place in Yu-Shan, and Eliara remembers it. "Please show respect and humility," she says, looking right at Tanuki. "This is not a short walk. You would do well to think carefully of what you will say to Victory."

Tanuki pulls back the cowl of his armor again, his expression sober. "Y'think maybe I'm gonna have special trouble showin' respect?" he says, raising an eyebrow and letting just the barest glimmer of amusement show through.

Eliara sighs audibly. "Well, whatever you do, don't provoke Victory." She shakes her head, leading on. Her words are true, it is not a short distance. The march from the Fountain of Venus to the Rings of Victory takes two hours. "In better times, we might have ridden instead of walked," explains Eliara, "But I do not know where the Guides are. In all likelihood, they are starved or working in new departments."

Tanuki nods. "Long as he ain't too full o' himself, I don't think I'm gonna have any problem wi' him." The young Trickster grins. "O'course, if he _is_ fulla himself, maybe you better leave me behind."

Victory's home is seen a long time before it is reached. The rings hover in the air at regular intervals, the largest are so vast that whole armies might fight upon them, and as the Exalts draw closer, more rings are revealed of many sizes and apparently with different terrains. Beneath these sits an old man surrounded by children. Each of these has three pairs of hands, and each of these pairs writes busily in thick books. "Those are the records of every battle that has taken place," whispers Eliara. Ryushi also knows that those records shall continue, recording the full story of every warrior and every battle that shall ever take place.

As he walks, Ryushi watches the publication of those books. In there, he muses, are his battles. Perhaps his predecessors' battles too. How much could he learn about himself by reading them? He shrugs to himself. Reading is no substitute for fighting; and it seems that fighting, not reading, will govern the destiny of Creation.

The old man looks up at Ryushi with a smile and waves the Exalts closer. "Come, sit among my scribes." In his eyes, visions of countless battles have been captured and play out endlessly. Other than this invitation, the old man says nothing, waiting patiently for his guests to explain themselves.

Pondering this for a moment, Ryushi comes to a decision. He reaches for a book, quill and ink. For the next several minutes he transcribes the details of the battle with the Sidereal before the Heptagram, highlighting Tanuki's efforts and his own, speaking not of honor or glory but of the simple technical details of the combat. Only after he has made this contribution to the god's nature, however paltry, does he prepare to speak.

The Dawn extends a hand; within it is the red gem, the last fragment of a god's existence. "I have seen the bearer of this thing die," he explains. "And I have seen some small part of the state of Celestial affairs. I've been asked to restore this god, but I lack the knowledge. To let such a thing lie is intolerable to my warrior's spirit. Thus I come to you. What I ask is that you remember whatever greatness this spark of Exaltation was capable of, and help me find the wisdom to exceed that by restoring Heaven and Earth."

Victory examines what he has been given with care. "I see the Convention of the West continues to fail. Long has it been since I have had much to speak of in that direction." He does not hesitate to answer. "I do of course remember you, Chosen of Helios, Caste of Dawn. You have worn many faces over the years, but you have never survived a loss in battle. I consider that impressive enough."

"Still, you do know a thing or two of what you must do," says Victory. "This battle is a matter of supply. Your ally's lines have been cut." He looks at Ryushi closely, "Does that help? A god without honor starves just like an army without food, water, and rest. Without these things, the morale and the strength of your forces fade and they will die."

"Without the Essence of veneration, the gods cannot sustain themselves," Ryu answers, nodding. "I see. I do not know the nature of this god, though. That much I can perhaps discover.."

"With effort all this are possible," replies Victory evenly. He chuckles and adds, "It is good to see you apply yourself with a bit more breadth this time. Seeing you puzzled is refreshing."

Ryushi smiles lamely, but rallies himself. "I must know this god's name and history. But knowing that, I think that I have a solution in mind... Thank you, Victory."

---

It is with Eliara's connivance and position among the Silver Pact that Ryushi's message is relayed. Through sorcery and other means, the No Moon manages to send messages to several influential Lunars, as well as a handful of younger members who feel their prestige will increase for involving themselves in such a thing. She informs Ryushi of the results, and he smiles. "Very well. This will be productive after all," he says. And to Meggan and Tanuki, once they are aboard the _Sun's Messenger_, he gives the heading of the meeting spot: "We go west, to the end of the world."

The Sidereals come. It is a mixture of strange faces with diverse backgrounds. They dress richly, most of them having robes different from those the Solars have seen before. There is no glint of gold about those, but instead a cunning inlay of substances that resemble starmetal. Of the full eleven who have come, only two wear robes with gold, and they are a rather subdued lot. Lydia is not present.

The Lunars are a far more strange mixture. Of these the greatest is a tall, coarse skinned barbarian who wears a skin that covers him just enough for decency. The Sidereals give him a lot of space, and those who stand with him do the same. His name is Ma-Ha-Suchi, and there are few names more terrifying to friends of the Realm.

Awaiting these two delegations are Ryushi and Tanuki, and whoever else had the willingness to stand by them and be counted. They are on a bare island of rock in the uttermost West, near indeed to the borders of the Wyld - the Sea here is hungry, and yet has still not claimed this little sliver of island.

Ma-Ha-Suchi and his allies glare at the Sidereals with open hatred. Still, they are bound by honor and the Silver Pact has no weight without its word. Nothing shall break it. "We have come, Solar." Ma-Ha-Suchi has little else to say. Across from him an old man with dark eyes says, "We have come, though we begin to wonder why."

Ryushi gestures behind him, out toward the open ocean. "The Silver Pact is undecided about the role of the Solar Exalted. The Sidereal fellowship is seemingly of two minds about it," he says. "I call upon you today to acknowledge a simple truth which confronts us all." He turns, and looks out across the wind-whipped waters.

"The world is dying. Fading away, lost to the chaos of the Wyld and the predations of the Fair Folk. The scars from the Contagion still linger in the east, and my master fought hobgoblins and their patrons in pockets of the Wyld which lingered near magic-rich tombs and other places laden with Essence."

"The Wyld still hungers. It will consume everyone and everything, in time."

The warrior continues. "Therefore I ask those of you here who feel that the Solars are a danger to the world, who feel that we should be hunted or killed - cast back this Wyld. Return the land that was here. And do so without the power of the Solar Exalted." He begins to look each delegate in the eye, moving from face to face, silently awaiting a response.

Ma-Ha-Suchi looks to the Wyld slowly. He will not lie, even in the face of the Sidereals whom he hates. "We could only do such a thing slowly, and it would not last long. The guardians are damaged or bereft of guidance, and the knowledge to regain them is the legacy of the Solars."

The Sidereal spokesman frowns and is not nearly so willing to speak. Finally he says, "It is our policy to hold what we can as long as we can. The alternative is madness and death. In the day of the Old Realm the maps were larger, but the danger to all of Creation was greater still. The nature of your kind is such that you will inevitably destroy all you make."

"And without us, inevitable destruction awaits you anyway. Is this not so?" asks Ryushi calmly.

The Sidereals glower at Ryushi, but Ma-Ha-Suchi roars with laughter. He is so overcome that he has to wipe his eyes before he can speak. "You see, they can't admit a thing without looking like they've been fed fire beets!" The other Lunars share the amusement at the Sidereal's expense.

Ryushi steps forward, raising a hand toward the Lunars in a bid for silence. "We all know it to be true," he says quietly. "Do you want this world that you have fought and sacrificed for to be extinguished? Do you really want to lose this precious existence that you cherish? _All_ of you?" He includes the Lunars now in this statement, looking from face to face. "Do you really fear us so much that you would sacrifice even this world?"

Ma-Ha-Suchi snorts. "We do not fear you. We remember you. I remember when my bride was one of your kin. It was not the Lunars who killed them! It was not the Silver Pact that gave the world into the hands of the stupid and inept children who hold the Old Realm's heart in their clumsy grip. Oh no!" Here he glares pure murder at the Sidereals, "It was the Chosen of Lies and Deceits who took the candle over the light of the Sun."

The Sidereal's leader sneers at Ma-Ha-Suchi, "No, but most of you stood aside. You knew that madness had taken your consorts. You did nothing! You watched and waited and more often than not fled farther and farther from the concerns of Creation. You call us liars? You lie to yourselves and lurk on the verge of the Wyld, little more than a shadow of what you were."

Ryushi steps forward decisively. His paired blades sing as they leave their sheaths, and he extends both of them out - each confronting one of the two factions. The swords twist and turn in his deft grip, changing position in moments from weapons of war outstretched .... to twin blades aimed at Ryushi's own throat. "I stand here now!" he bellows. "Whatever has passed before is _over now!_" He pauses, speaking no less loudly, but maintaining a steady tone of voice to hide the shakiness of his feelings. "Hope stands before you! Dangerous hope. Risky hope. But hope. Now. Decide for yourselves whether to take these blades and strike me down, but _you will not risk the world I love while I still live._ Do you understand?"

What follows is chaotic and fast, blindingly fast. The Sidereal spokesman moves at Ryushi swiftly, his intent clear. But the mighty fist of Ma-Ha-Suchi in its hybrid form shatters the body of the enemy, casting it to the ground with such force that a crater forms at the feet of the other Sidereals and a wind sends them stumbling back. The voice of the great Lunar comes now like a terrifying roar, "To threaten the life of the host is sacrilege with but one punishment! Choose your path with care. I march with the Solars at my side, and I care little if I spill your blood or protect it." The terror of Ma-Ha-Suchi is so great that the other Sidereals stumble back from his towering form, twice the height of even the Dawn Caste. Behind this great Lunar his kin have followed suit, and they stand ready to prove the words of their battle leader with the blood of their enemies.

Ryushi waits patiently. As things begin to settle down again, he quietly sighs. "Three choices lie ahead. A world without the Solars. A world where the Solars are the friends and allies of the Celestials. Or a world where they are your implacable enemies. You speak much of the damage we have done when we were with you, when you knew us. Think carefully about what we could do if we were enemies." He lets this sink in for a moment, but continues before anyone takes it as a declaration of war.

"I have called you here to remind you of these things. But I have also called you here to ask a favor. It is the only thing I will hold you to. All else that I have said is to consider and debate amongst yourselves."

"Will you, the Sidereals, and you, the Lunars, hear my boon?"

"We will hear you," replies Ma-Ha-Suchi. His eyes are still locked on the mass of Sidereals, daring them, hoping for them to dare attack again. Perhaps it is simply that the Sidereals have grown foolish or lazy, but the eyes of young and old alike seem utterly shocked by the power of the Lunar before them.

With their spokesman lying boneless and half-buried, the Sidereals seem unsure of just who is to lead, and hands flash among the majority of them as they try to figure this out. Seeing a chance, a Sidereal in gold steps forth and says, "We will hear you as well." She bends down to the corpse at her feet and with casual ease plucks a small symbol of leadership from it. "And there will be no more dangerous action without due process."

Ryushi nods slowly. "What I wish is this. That you do nothing." He lets this sink in for a moment. "If you wish to fight over the Blessed Isle, I will not stand in your way. It is clear that the Empress was the keystone of that arch, and it is now crumbling of its own volition. Little more needs doing to see it fall forever. While I do not wish that, I will not involve myself in it."

"So fight over it, if you wish. Play out your conflicts and your ancient rivalries. But as for me - do nothing. I am no king. I will sit on no throne. I will have my due, and that is the restoration of the island that used to lie yonder. But I have no wish to usurp your territories and fiefs, your lands and tribes. I wish only to protect this world. I ask that you do not stand in the way of my doing so."

The words surprise Ma-Ha-Suchi and the Sidereals as well. Still, it is the Lunar who speaks first. "Then you shall have your space so long as you swear to battle the Wyld and do all you can to drive it back. We will attend to the rest, as our honor demands."

The Sidereal tilts her head, looking over Ryushi as if she had never seen a man before. At least not this kind of man. "We will carry your words back and agree for now with a provision. You must allow one of our number to travel with you. That one shall be bound by True Oaths so they can be no threat."

"I accept your provision, with one of my own. Whoever you send will bear witness to the deeds of the reborn Solars, and in no way shall he misrepresent us - neither our good nor our evil." Ryushi smiles. "Let us truly see what the Solars are made of."

"So be it," answers the Sidereal. She looks thoughtful for a moment, and turns to speak with the others. The words are all in that strange sign language, and it seems that whatever is being suggested vexes the spokesman, but amuses the other Sidereals, particularly those not in gold. After a few minutes of this, she turns and says, "I shall be bound to this task myself, and the agreement will be carried back to Yu-Shan by my second."

Ryushi bows low to the assembled host. "I thank you for your attendance. I have set myself to this task. I will see it through."

The attendees are not quite finished with their tasks, however. It seems that the binding of the Sidereal will take place now, and Eliara is chosen to administer it with the aid of three Sidereals and another No Moon. Ma-Ha-Suchi watches with grim satisfaction and ensures that all the proper measures are taken. Only when it is done will the Lunar Hero leave, and he pauses to nod to Ryushi. "Not bad." From Ma-Ha-Suchi, those are words of high praise.
