# Rise of Madness 2007-03-18

Since the forging of the agreement, the Solars have found themselves with a new ally for their forces. "I can't believe you were foolish enough to poke your nose in Yu-Shan." Not the cheeriest or most friendly ally, but it seems that Ascendance is at least stuck on their side. "Then you walk up to a greater god and chat away as if he were a childhood friend."

"The sword is not subtle but it achieves results when drawn," is Ryushi's only answer to this criticism.

"You are definitely not subtle," replies the Sidereal. She sighs deeply and rubs her eyes. "But you haven't gotten yourself killed yet, and that's saying something." Ascendance's eyes flick to the front of the ship for a moment. She's been watching Meggan quite closely the whole journey, obviously curious. "And you have a most interesting entourage. You really will need to tell me the whole story."

The swordsman considers the wisdom of a particularly snide comment. It takes little at all to bite off the observation that the Sidereals have not seemed interested in the 'whole story'. Instead, he remains carefully neutral when speaking aloud. "Very well." With that, he begins recounting his meeting with Tanuki and Meggan.

Ascendance listens carefully, and asks piercing questions. She seems interested not just in facts, but in Ryushi's feelings and thoughts. Her bright eyes lock on the Solar's with each question, and if Ryushi proves evasive, she will wait, then cut back into the same question from a new angle moments later, using slightly different words. The entire telling takes hours, and by that point the Dawn Caste is likely to feel exhausted, while Ascendance just smiles and leans back, "Very interesting. Very interesting, indeed."

"It seems clear that fate is following a new path," says Ascendance. "Your chance meeting with each other, and then will still more allies just in the very moment when you can help each other the most means a great deal. From what you've told me, your mind is still clear. You have confidence, but aren't quite what I'd consider arrogant." She looks once more to Meggan, "Not to even mention that one."

The warrior isn't sure what to think or say, even with the story he's told and Ascendance's reactions to it. "We're just trying to make our way in the world," he observes, studying the woman carefully.

For the first time since she was assigned to the Solars, Ascandance smiles. "You are doing more than that, though. You see.." She turns to Ryushi, leaning so that her face is very near his, "You must do more than that. You have to save Creation, Ryushi of the Dawn Caste, Chosen of the Unconquered Sun. Your drive to regain the west is a great one, and that convention is desperate for your help. You have bound yourself to the Sidereals who are the most receptive. They have no hope unless you give it to them. Thousands of gods are begging and many will die if something isn't done."

"While we're on th'subject, what d'you mean, 'that one'?" Tanuki pipes up, leaning forward, his eyes glinting. "She 'as a name, ya know."

Ascendance looks to Tanuki, her smile fading a little. If the Solars were to put any word to her expression, it would be worried or uncertain. Her voice is soft, "She doesn't know her name, but it is not your right nor mine to give that to her."

"She is Meggan," says Ryushi firmly. "Though the world rejects us, we fight for people like her."

Tanuki looks puzzled, and scratches his head for a moment, until the light dawns in his eyes. "An' if she ever wants ta find out her..." He fumbles for the words, lacking the occult training to express what he's dimly guessed. "her other name, if there's anythin' I--, uh, we, c'n do to help her, we will."

Ascendance nods to Tanuki. "She is Meggan," she repeats sadly. "Yet she was born to be so much more." The Sidereal settles back in her seat. It's obvious she doesn't like this subject. "So what do you intend to do next, Lawgivers?"

Tanuki's eyes glint again, this time in amusement. "Why, we'll be layin' down the law, o'course. Won't we, Ryushi?" he says, flashing a saucy grin and winking at his fellow Solar. Ascendance may be on their team, after a fashion, but that doesn't mean she's immune to being needled.

"Well now.." Ryushi smiles calmly. He turns to regard Ascendance, staying silent for a long time. "What do you think law is? The decree of the powerful? The will of the gods who Exalted us? Or a thing of its own?"

"Law is the code which will keep all of Creation healthy, maintaining the necessary balances between life and death, joy and pain, even order and chaos," replies Ascendance. "Law has always come from those wise enough to codify it and strong enough to enforce it."

The Dawn nods. He draws his sword from its belt, still sheathed, and holds it out as a prop for demonstration. "This is the law," he says. "This is who we wish to be."

"The Solars once ruled all of Creation," murmurs Ascendance. "They used that, but they also used the weapons that were the most valuable to the people: their hearts. You are strong, but you have not set yourself to be a petty warlord, though you've had many opportunities."

Ryushi shakes his head. "You do not understand. For the law to be more than a dream in the hearts of the oppressed, the sword must _remain_ sheathed. The ultimate technique of swordsmanship is to succeed in your goal while never drawing your weapon." He slides the weapon away, back in his belt. "The people fear a strong ruler, but love a benevolent one. The ruler who has Heaven's blessing will know this."

Ascendance seems rather taken aback. "A philosopher and thinker with a blade?" she muses. She sounds impressed, and if her expression is any guide, is annoyed by it. "But you haven't answered my question. They sent me to observe, but I will also serve in what ways I can."

"But if you don't understand us, what you see and hear will be meaningless, won't it?" Ryushi asks pointedly. "Have you been hungry, or thirsty? Have you been hated? Have you seen the crushing despair that sweeps across Creation? Do you feel the pain of others?"

"You see things from below, we see them from above," replies Ascendance. "I have seen gods once proud reduced to begging for food. I have seen goddesses of great beauty wither and die because those who followed them have been enslaved and broken by the Fair Folk. I do not need to look at the rotting floorboards to know the roof is falling in."

"You see these things, and yet the Chosen of the Stars fear my goal - driving back the Wyld, reclaiming Creation for mankind." Ryushi shakes his head. "A fast battle traded for a slow suicide."

"They fear you," replies Ascendance. "They do not fear your success, they fear what you might become." The Sidereal sighs once more. "The First Age ended when the Solars became so proud that they grew mad, and all of Creation stood on the brink of disaster. At the time, it was decided that the reign of the Solars would have to be brought to a close."

"Yet the Usurpation eventually failed to do what was hoped," explains the Sidereal. "The Solars could not be truly destroyed. They kept coming back. Yet fate had turned away from them, and so their attempts to restore their power failed. Until this day. I am the first Sidereal to be officially assigned to a Lawgiver since the Old Realm fell."

Ryushi nods slowly. "Then is it not the will of Heaven that we resume our role?"

"The Will of Heaven is far from clear," replies Ascendance. "But there are some of us who believe that the Solars must return, that they must lead the way once more." The Sidereal looks down at her hands, "I am among them. It's clear that soon there will be nothing left. What good is a sane world that shall die in a few decades?"

Ryushi smiles quietly. "Well. We shall fight for what we can."
