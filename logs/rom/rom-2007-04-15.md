# Rise of Madness 2007-04-15

Some cities, like Paragon, are named for their rulership. Others, like the Lap, for their characteristic landmarks. But others, like Gem and Harborhead, are named for their role in the economy of Creation. And thus, everyone who is anyone in Harborhead, either within, outside, or above the law, pays attention to what's going on at the docks and the sprawling markets next to them.

And though the Trickster of Harborhead is famed for having a thousand faces, there is still one face that is _known_ to go with the name. So when that face is seen arriving on a ship from Chiaroscuro, after having been absent from the city for months, everyone is talking about it. Merchants tighten their grip on their purses, city guards look much more alert than usual, and the girls in the seedier bars in town look up whenever someone walks in.

And some of those glances are rewarded by a glimpse of the Trickster himself, as Tanuki saunters in, shooting the breeze with old acquaintances, pinching the butts of the cuter barmaids, and unobtrusively pantsing obnoxious drunks who cause more trouble than Tanuki deems appropriate. He seems interested in hearing about anything and everything that was going on in his absence, though he repays them with tales of his exploits that are utter fiction. Only his more trusted confidants get to learn of his particular interest in rumors concerning the fortunes of Simeon the Fat.

Of course, in this environment, anyone who does _not_ obviously look like the Trickster doesn't get as much attention. So a strong-looking, solidly built and well-armed man who'd come in on the same boat - especially one who wasn't seen associating with Tanuki on the voyage - is pigeonholed as just another sword-for-hire, given no more attention from the city watch than such men normally get. And if he's seen in the parts of town that Tanuki is known to lurk in, well, that's not unusual. All sorts of rough types hang out there.

What the Trickster learns about Simeon may be surprising. His fortunes have been taking turns for the worse ever since his daughter was taken. He still holds much power here, but there are whispers of unpaid tabs and bad business ventures, things that would never have been heard of in the past.

Tanuki contemplates the rumors. He knew Simeon would be personally devastated by Meggan's abduction, but the man seems to be losing his grip generally. Is he just that broken by the loss, or was Meggan tied to his fortunes somehow? _...Well, that's what I came here to find out, isn't it?_ he thinks to himself, as he dons the Crimson Armor in the shadows of an abandoned rooftop. His next mission is to see for himself how Simeon's declining fortunes have affected his security - has Simeon skimped on paying his guards, or has he tightened it up to hold all the tighter to what's left?

Simeon's actions have something of a frantic twist to them. Being a practical man, he's cut the number of guards. After Meggan was taken, many found themselves thrown out without pay. Every story about Simeon seems to start after that fateful theft and go forward from there. The fat man is reported to be an even bigger miser since then. Of all things said, that's about the nicest. Some even whisper of dark offerings and rituals that Simeon has performed to maintain himself.

Of all the rumors Tanuki has collected since his return to Harborhead, it is these last that actually give the Trickster pause. Dark forces manifestly _exist_ in Creation, as he has come to learn - and at least some of them have a definite and malign interest in Meggan. He's still confident he can handle it, but this may not be a milk run after all; he is glad of the First Age armor and weapons that he has won, and that Ryushi will be there to back him up if things get dicey.

---

The front hall of Simeon's palatial mansion exemplifies its primary virtue: the spacious openness of the whole building. Perhaps this is amplified by the absence of things which once cluttered up the room. Paintings on walls, bodyguards, courtiers among them. Still, there's enough of a showing of ex-soldiers, mercenaries and cutthroats to qualify as a crowd. Five of them are playing a difficult-to-master dice game that has accounted for 3% of all lost fingers in the South, mostly due to the unofficial ruling involving knives during the money-exchanging phase.

There's a few sharp raps at the front door. The accustomed leader of the squad beckons with his three fingers at the junior man at the table, indicating that he should open it while the others rearrange his dice for him. Duly this junior approaches the door, peeking out of the spy-glass inset into the Southeastern imported wood. What he sees outside in the dark is a man running full bore at the door and leaping to deliver a savage kick.

The front doors slam open, knocking the man back and sending him skidding across the expensive marble. The dice-players rise from their seats to see a masked figure, wielding two swords, striding purposefully into the front hall across the prone body of the unfortunate guard. Blades, spikes, maces, and a variety of other weapons appear in their hands.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the mansion, a balcony door swings back and forth in a brief breeze, and a guard sighs and strolls over to bolt it properly, grumbling to himself about the last shift forgetting to secure it. He never sees the brief flicker of the air as Tanuki strolls by him on cat feet. The Trickster feels a little guilty about using First Age armor to befuddle a slow-witted house guard, but every so often he feels he has to revel in his divine power.

After effecting his entrance, though, Tanuki gets more serious, taking to the ceilings and walls, avoiding patrols and masking his movements just as he did the first time he made this run. Though he does his best not to rely on the Crimson Armor, he does have a brief scare, when he looks across a hall and notices a guard staring right at him. The fixed gaze shakes the Trickster for a moment... until the guard starts picking his nose, and Tanuki realizes that the man is actually staring at the deer's head trophy that Tanuki has used as a temporary perch. Shrugging, Tanuki moves on, tightening up his act still further.

Since Tanuki has been here before, he knows the layout well, and eventually makes his way to the large room that serves as Simeon's office. By strange chance-or perhaps something quite different-Simeon is seated there, alone. His raven-black eyes stare at the door. They show no emotion, no drive, nothing. Before anything else in the room, those eyes stand out. They are not the eyes of Simeon the Fat. Other things have changed, as well. The decorations of the room have been removed, leaving a rather spartan look to the place. The only remaining stamp of life in this office is a horrific painting that hangs behind Simeon's head. On that frame is depicted a mixture of horrors all wound about a dragon-figure so black that it seems to suck the light from the room. As soon as Tanuki crosses the threshold Simeon looks away from the door and a mirthless smirk curves his darkened lips.

Behind his visor, Tanuki raises an eyebrow. Rumors, eh? They didn't get the half of it. The Trickster steps to one side and leans against the wall, his arms folded, noting how those obsidian eyes follow his movements. The deathly silence prevails for another few heartbeats, and then Tanuki speaks, softly. "G'd evenin'. They call me the Trickster - I assume you've heard o' me. Who're you?"

"The pithy stories of the fools who populate this city are of no interest to me, so I do not know you, but I know the scent of a Solar." Those black eyes never lose their lock on Tanuki. A strange thrill runs down Tanuki's spine as he hears those words. Beyond the words, there's an instinct, an innate knowledge that the enemy he was built to face is before him. Knowing almost nothing of ancient lore, he knows he fences with the servant of the Yozis. Somehow the Solar is sure that even if he had just seen this figure from across a busy street he would know it.

Tanuki keeps his tone casual and conversational, though his body is primed for action. "Do ya now? Well, I had a couple questions for ol' Simeon, but I guess you'll hafta do." As if he expects any straight answers here. "First, though, if y'don't mind me askin, what'd a clown like Simeon have ta offer you?" This is no longer the time to inquire about Meggan directly, even though the thing probably already knows about her already.

"Simeon no longer had anything to offer me, which is why you will not be able to speak to him," replies the Adversary. The smile parts its grey lips and beyond them are teeth decayed beyond easy recognition. A horrible stench wafts out from that mouth, but Tanuki feels a glow form around him, holding the taint away. The brilliance of the Unconquered Sun surges unbidden from his caste mark and the black eyes are quickly shaded by a raised hand.

"Well, that's a shame," drawls Tanuki. And as he speaks, his hand flicks out with a lightning motion, sending a handful of steel hurtling toward the thing that was once Simeon, then darting out of the door faster than the beat of a hummingbird's wings. He hardly expects the throwing knives to do any real damage; their main purpose is to indicate that the conversation is over.

Tanuki is able to dodge out the door just in time. He can hear the sound of metal tearing through the walls behind him. "YOU THINK YOU CAN FLEE FROM ME?!" booms out that black voice. Simeon certainly could not be fast enough to match Tanuki step for step, but whatever this thing is apparently doing just that. Tanuki can see his options cut off one by one as he darts through the mansion. Bars are thrown, shutters slam shut and almost melt together.

Tanuki is hardly surprised by the close pursuit, but he does have an answer. "Nope! Ain't tryin'!" he calls cheerfully, pausing only once in his headlong flight to take a potshot at the Adversary with Silent Rain. Even that brief gesture gives the creature a chance to eat up a bit of Tanuki's lead, and the Trickster forges ahead. As the mansion reshapes itself according to the demon's will, Tanuki abandons his knowledge of the place's layout, instead letting the light of the Unconquered Sun well up inside him, letting his instincts guide him to a place where he can harry the enemy in his own peculiar way.

That path carries Tanuki into a back hallway that comes to a dead end. Just as the night caste skids to a half dozens of fine holes are blasted through the wall before him. Light of red, blue, and green punches through, mingling with white until a display as impressive as the night sky is set before him. The whole structure shudders and then the wall breaks. Beyond that hole a slender hand can be seen, waiting to pull Tanuki up.

Tanuki doesn't hesitate, reaching out to clasp that hand. The Sun is strong in him now, and his faith is absolute. His instincts _will not_ steer him wrong, will not allow him to be deceived. He knows this as surely as he knows his very self.

"It is wise to trust fate," notes Victoria. The Gold Sidereal's form is alive with energy as well, a skyfull of stars swirls around her and as she races across the rooftop, Tanuki can sense a strange tingling. Most who have heard of the Sidereals only guess what it must feel like to have fate woven about them. Tanuki can now feel it, as every step he takes is guided by the stars, every slip and jolt perfectly calculated to help him avoid a thrown dagger just before it can cut off his auspicious destiny. "It seems those in power have noticed you," Victoria teases.

"Yep," agrees Tanuki, as he feels a breeze blow by his ear, knowing that it was a near miss that had no chance of ever hitting. "Fate's all o'er the place here, I reckon. Him waitin' fer me here like that."

"He has nothing to do with Fate," replies Victoria. The Sidereal glares back and notes, "We need to get out of here before we die." Her path is carefully guided, and soon Ryushi's musings with his unconcious friends are interrupted by a surge through his caste mark and a shout from the Sidereal. "Dawn Caste! We could use an exit strategy!" Even when she's bearing the name Ascendance she has a tendency to not use Ryushi's name.

Ryushi gestures with a thumb at the broken doors. "Your departure will not be hampered," he promises, as Daoyang flashes into existence in his grasp.

"This way!" Tanuki says, pointing in a new direction. This isn't the first time he's fled the mansion of Simeon the Fat with darkness at his heels, but this second flight is far more spectacular. A brilliant violet speck, and a twin golden glow, streaks across the slumbering rooftops of Harborhead, surrounded by a swirling rainbow constellation trailing around them both - and behind, the night is swallowed by a deeper Darkness.

Ryushi has not lain idle. As the pair above him run off in retreat, he acted. The sound of crashing and tearing masonry and wood follows Tanuki and his Sidereal ally into the night, for the Dawn has carved out large chunks of the adjacent building with his monstrous daiklave. That golden blade is now all that props up what's left of the building, reflecting light from inside the mansion onto Ryushi's attentive eye. As Simeon's weight lands on the roof, the upright sword wedged in the hole between roof and floor quivers ever so slightly. And Ryushi snatches it away, dashing off after his friends, leaving behind him a toppling building for the creature to contend with.

Into the tumbling building the creature that wears Simeon's face falls. It does slow it down, giving the Dawn and his allies time to put a great distance between themselves and their enemy. Free to race all the way to the docks some intense force drags their attention back.

Towering from the home of Simeon is a column of black that stands out from the nightsky as clearly as the moon. This impenetrable darkness billows ever higher, like the rising ash of a volcano, and in the distance the eyes of the Exalts make out, here and there, bits of something like ash striking the ground.

Tanuki shakes his head. "Well, so much f'r Simeon," he says, briefly saddened by the consequences he incurred by meddling with forces that were beyond him. And, for the time being, are beyond Tanuki, as well. "I hate t'let Meg get anywhere near that thing, but..." He glances at Ascendance. "What're our chances if we just take us a boat, d'you think?" he says, doubtful that any mortal vessel could outpace the Adversary.

Ascendance frowns thoughtfully. "Whatever we take, we better get out of here right away. Something is happening to this place, and it's not good." Everywhere in the city doors are swinging open and the people are starting to flee. Near the home of Simeon a beam of hideous green light stretches skyward. It sweeps open like a fan when its length reaches some fifty paces, and a wide, hazy portal opens. On the far side is a vision of dances flames and horrible, tormented forms. Here and there the least of these pause and beat at the portal, stretching it but not getting through. Not yet.

"Do the Celestials still bicker amongst themselves about old grudges?" asks Ryu quietly, looking skyward.

"When we are gazing into the jaws of Malfeas those old grudges fade fast," replies Victoria. "At least, I would hope so." She finds herself wanting to shrink away, wanting to flee, and its obvious that the Sidereal's courage is being sorely tested.

Right here and now, Tanuki has no interest in who bickers with whom, and has no shame at all in fleeing something more powerful than himself. "_Sun's Messenger_ it is, then," he says, turning away from the actinic spectacle. "The lighthouse!" he says, pointing out into the harbor. "Highest point around, bein' a beacon's what it's for." He glances at Ryushi. "Fastest way to get there - swim, rowboat, steal a ship?"

Tanuki glances at Ascendance. "How fast can _you_ swim, ma'am?" he says as he leaps off, leading the way down to the docks. The commotion is starting as the panicked crowd races for the boats, but in the confusion it would be easy to commandeer a rowboat. "Unless it's pretty damn fast, you better ride."

"We have no time for foolishness, and those people need every boat and more," replies Victoria. She skids to a halt on the docks and stretches her hands before her, "It's not fast, but it'll save lives. Just keep them from trampling me!" She focuses her eyes on a derelict boat that is settled on the docks, where repairs had likely just been starting on its battered frame. Though Ryushi doesn't immediately recognize the spell, the arcane workings of essence are so obvious that even mortals can see them. Those mortals give a wide bearth around the casting of Ascendance, and in a short time the boat begins to float on air, enfused with the mighty powers of the sapphire circle.

Tanuki stares at the hovering vessel for a moment, then manages a nod. "Okay, that works too."

The craft takes to the sky slowly, adding speed as it moves away from the dock. "I have to do something for those people." Victoria doesn't need to guide the craft. Her focus makes use of the stars spinning about her. They fly off of her like shooting stars, and though their impact is beyond sight, the Solars can feel fate changing. A child slips out of the hands of her mother only to be caught and thrown right back up into her arms by a sudden surging wave, an old man's stumble causes him to fall off the dock to land just as a sailor below tosses back a bag of grain to cushion the fall. Throughout the city fate is rewritten in the face of horror. Victoria's face betrays the strain of it all, but she continues, fighting against the terror of that gate with all her strength.

The _Sun's Messenger_ meets with its passengers at the light-house, as arranged, and the aerial craft speeds off with great haste. All aboard are concerned, perhaps dismayed, by the recent events. It's not clear what should be told to Meggan, but Ryushi firmly believes it will be Tanuki who'll do the telling. And Ascendance has an easy out as well - she must now report the events that transpired. She explains that the services of a desert god will be enough to take her to the Celestial City, in a quirky sort of punishment. For, it turns out, it was his machinations and magic that brought her leagues upon leagues over the desert and out of her expected path, all to ask about some unnatural goings-on in Harborhead.
