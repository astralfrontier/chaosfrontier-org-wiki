# Rise of Madness 2007-11-03

It is dark in the greatest of all cities. Yu-Shan, the city of a million songs, of endless joy and laughter, is all but silent. A small cherubic spirit is the only source of light along a vast street leading from the Hall of Records to the Place of Infinite Contemplation. In the light of that spirit two shapes can be made out. One is robed in rich gold, and the other in silver. "So I can count on your aid?" The voice comes from the gold. It is a woman's voice, strong and full of conviction.

"Yes. The laws are clear, and even without them our two paths have always seemed to be joined in my mind." The silver is a man, and though his skin looks especiall cracked with age in the flickering light there is a great power in his voice. "I do not know how you found that law. It has escaped notice for an age."

The gold stops, and the silver quickly follows suit. The small cherub that was lighting the way has fallen to the road and with a last, sad sigh crumples into glittering dust. The gold's voice rises, "There was no need of it until now."

"We called them Lawgivers, and though we remember the name it has almost become a careless tradition. We have forgotten what it meant." The gold's laugh stands out strangely and for a moment drives the darkness back. "They are teaching you again, aren't they?" muses the silver.

"Yes. Already I think I have learned that when they were destroyed, it was the Sidereals that were falling." The gold says no more, but leads on, with the power of Solar Law shielding her from any weaving of destiny and a rather unexpected ally at her side.

The gathering of every Sidereal in creation is a rare event, one that is almost impossible to achieve, even for the Steersman, so it is with a most profound confusion that every Sidereal suddenly finds themselves seated here, in a room that they have not united in since the Usurpation.

There is a soft buzz of murmurs amongst the various factions. More troubling than being summoned, they find they are not able to move about the room to sit with their allies. Instead, they are arranged in a pattern crafted by Law.

Fate is strong here, and its webbings can be seen occasionally in the air as bits of the great pattern glimmer in and out of focus. Standing before this collection of powerful Celestials is a long woman wearing a robe woven with strands of starmetal. Her position causes much comment and more than a few dark looks. For all this talking, none can raise their voices against her.

"Seven years, seven months, seven days, seven hours, seven minutes, and seven seconds after the victory over the Primordials the Solar Deliberative, greatest of all governing forces on Creation, convened and with the blessing of the Gods accepted the terms of ultimate surrender from their enemies," announces Ascendence.

"For years the exact binding was worked again and again by the greatest of hands, including both Celestials and the Gods themselves. Thousands of ammendments were made to this binding, and now when we see it those changes play out before our eyes in a stream of rules so complex that none living can comprehend it." She sees resistance among those listening. They do not like being lectured concerning a matter they all know.

"Naturally we have all studied this matter to varying degrees," says Ascendence. "The wall of binding which holds that great work is a monument that every Sidereal must be familiar with. However, there are words on the binding that no Sidereal seems to read. Or at least none grasp."

"Until now." At her side, an old Sidereal rises, his robe of silver is gone, replaced to match that of Ascendence. "She speaks of the words in the Old Realm that we have always assumed were nothing more than builder's mark on the wall. His name was Edward, and history remembers that he was the greatest craftsman of an age of greatest craftsmen. What history forgets is that Edward had another name."

"Edward of Cara's greatest gift to history was his unprecedented valor and virtue, which led him to become the Heirophant of the Deliberative." At last the Steersman finds himself able to speak, though much to his irritation he cannot yet challenge the purpose of this meeting. Still, he finds some grim satisfaction in the mutterings and general shock of those around him.

"The Steersman is correct," says Ascendence. "Edward of Cora was not only a Solar, but the greatest Lawgiver of the age. In fact, it is Edward who gave the title 'Lawgiver' true meaning. His ethical codes are legend, but few knew that one of his most critical contributions was never recorded in the Book of Three Circles. It only exists on the wall itself, and of all things on the wall, it is the only thing that is above all ammending."

"Inside Edward's signature a Law is written in orichalcum that even the gnawing of the Ebon Dragon cannot twist or pervert," she explains. "That law cannot be twisted because it does not impose itself against the Yozis and their minions, but instead binds us. It is a simple law, and one written for a day as horrible as this one."

The Steersman raises an eyebrow, but says nothing as a matter of choice. Inside his mind he can feel the pattern revealing itself at last, and without ever reading, he can hear the words of Edward and more importantly, can hear the spark of his exaltation repeating them.

"The ultimate purpose of the Chosen is to stand as bulwarks of Creation against her enemies, including even her makers, the Primordials themselves. To bind the Primordials from their creation forever is known to be impossible, and so the day shall come that the Ebon Dragon shall break free and all Creation shall again be in danger."

"To stand against the inevitable sundering of the Chosen that time shall bring, and to protect our sacrifices against any floundering in some distant future, the Chosen have place upon themselves a Law of Binding. We, the Exalted of the Sun, the Moon, and the Maidens hereby swear to do our duty: to fight against this enemy until time itself dies, for there is no end to this war."

"None may stand aside, all must fight."

When the words sink into the minds of the Sidereals a deep silence blankets the room for several minutes. Only after this long does it seem that the reluctant are finally able to accept what has happened. The Steersman rises and says, "Our duty was made into Law, and through the ages we have always striven to achieve it. Now, the greatest of all Lawgivers calls upon us from beyond the window of death."

"Yes, he calls to us," says Ascendence. "You have guided our kind for an age now, Steersman. You had the helm, but you have failed Creation. A gate to Malfeas has opened in Harborhead, and the last strands of the binding are weakening. The factions of the Sidereals have blinded us for too long. We are not Lawgivers!" She slams her fist down and the room shakes around her. "I am Ascendence, not of the Gold! Not of the Bronze! I serve the Deliberative, I follow the ancient laws, and any who stand against the Ebon Dragon must now decide. Cast off the gold, the silver, and the bronze. That age is past, for there is no victory against this enemy without the might of the Solars and Lunars."

Some would like to make points of contention, to argue against the possibility that such a gate could ever open. Fate weaves through the room, and the terrors of Harborhead spill out clearly. The enormous gap in fate is telling. "It is beyond doubt, now," whispers the Steersman.

"What do we do now?" asks a young Sidereal. Her robe of bronze is cast aside, as she selects nudity over the failed trappings of the past.

"We do what we were meant to do," answers Ascendance. "We must send aid to the Solars immediately. There are so many who have no guidance, no protection. There is a Lunar on the Blessed Isle in danger. Someone will deliver him to his own people. It is time we stopped disrupting the other Celestials."

Above the Sidereals, unseen, but far from unfelt, float Saturn and Jupiter. Jupiter says quietly, "I have forgotten." Saturn smiles blandly in response, "Strange, I just started to remember."
