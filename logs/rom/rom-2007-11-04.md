# Rise of Madness 2007-11-04

After centuries of isolation Burning Spire has become one of the busiest cities in the south. Spheroids and other automatons race about the place and essence hums through the air. Even with a living population that rarely breaks ten people the city has a life to it that is hard to match.

In the darkness the Solars find it easily, a glowing beacon in the night. Meggan is again guided to land and as is becoming the new custom, the group is met at the landing platform.

This time the Solars are met in a more grand manner. An automaton is present, as are three spheroids. More interestingly, Ryushi sees familiar faces as Lydia and Ascendence are waiting. Even in the few moments that it takes to reach them Ryushi can just barely make out flickers of light and Tanuki can hear soft whispers as messages are bourne to the Sidereals and carried quickly back to heaven.

"Welcome back to the Burning Spire, Lawgivers," intones Lydia proudly. "I think we have a great deal to talk about."

Ryushi extends his hands, palms out in invitation. "Speak."

Ascendence raises a hand and a queue of flickering cherubs begins to form. "Things have changed in Yu-Shan. We will help you now, Lawgiver, as is our duty. It seems that the wisest of all Solars knew that a day might come when the children of the Deliberative would flounder and fail. Law binds us to serve and advise again."

"Then we must close the abomination at Harborhead." Ryushi's priorities are simple. "Tell me how."

"You must master the Adamant Circle," answers Ascendence. Lydia looks surprised, but then smiles. "We must find the Book of Three Circles," says the Head of the Convention of Water. "It is the greatest tome of magic, and it alone is ancient enough to know how to defeat these gates."

The Solar swordsman just smiles. "The Adamant Circle is what I already seek. But if this book has been lost for so long, will we so easily find it in time? Is there not another way?"

"The Book will not allow itself to be lost so easily," replies Lydia. "I think we can find it, and I believe it will want to be found. An artifact of its power has a potent spirit and great vision."

Ascendence nods slowly, "And with the help of the Lunars and Ami's creations, I believe no matter where it is, it will be found. Not even the Wyld could easily consume that most sacred tome."

Ryushi stays quiet. In truth, he's very surprised that things have changed so much. But unlike the older Celestials, he has not enough experience with the ways of the City and its inhabitants to realize the scope of this change. Finally he speaks again. "Then we will find it. But first, there is a holy day I must bring about."

"A holy day?" asks Ascendence. "Ah, do you mean your service to the Western Convention?" She is aware of that arrangement, it seems. "It may be that one leads to the other."

"A holy day to bring back that which is lost," says Ryu. He does not clarify further. "This is in the service of Heaven, and so I ask. Who will assist me in seeing it carried out?"

"I do not think you fully understand," says Ascendence. "The Law has been restored. We will guide and serve you. It is for you to decide whether or not we should assist you." Lydia adds with an a glint in her eyes, "Within reason, of course. The heroes of the first age understand, and I think you do as well, that the Mantle of Creation lies upon your shoulders, and to wear it you must occasionally stand on your own."

"I wear the mantle of war. Others are not well suited to me," Ryu answers gruffly. "For long fights, use the spear. For close work, use the shortsword. For battle, the Dawn is suited. But I am not a knowledgeable man."

"Then we will be your wisdom, but whatever you think of yourself, Ryushi of the Dawn Caste, your will and guidance will shape the age to come." Ascendence's words are calm, but they are not easy for her to admit. "Perhaps your humility and sense of justice will be enough. You wish to bring about the restoration of a fallen goddess. To do so, we must create a most auspicious event."

Ryushi nods. "Passion and euphoria can come from many things. From drugs; from pleasure; from emancipation from oppression. If any of these will serve, I can proceed."

"It must come in the west, I think," says Ascendence. "This fits the greatest need of the age. The Wyld is besting us. If we could strike against it, we would finally be able to say we have started to do our duty once more."

"Then come." Ryushi turns and begins to walk back aboard the _Sun's Messenger_. "We'll start now."

Ascendence raises an eyebrow and moves forward. "I guess this means I won't need to attend that committee meeting." Lydia laughs quietly and says, "Don't worry, I'm filling reports right now. The news is reaching Yu-Shan now."

The news does move fast, it seems. Around the Sun's Messenger a dozen shapes flicker into view, gods of battle and war manifesting. A whisper that shakes the very ground says, "We have heard the Lawgivers have come to do battle. Once, in disgrace, we failed to come to your aid. You will not fight alone again."
