# Rise of Madness 2007-12-08

In the south, the reach of Ami the Maker is growing and growing. The southern barbarians are starting to take note of the cities that are unfolding around them. With the wariness of their people they creep into these oddities and find that beyond all comprehension, they are not resisted and even more, the strange creatures of metal speak their language and will obey their will.

In the north, strange whispers spread of a great tyrant or great liberator. They call him the Bull of the North, and the chaos that had been spun out from his every move is being quietly rewoven in the Heavens so that one by one the powers of the north are being drawn to his power.

In the east the Lunars are waking, their barbarian hordes mustering and moving quietly west and north towards the Hundred Kingdoms. The power of the Dragon Blooded is going to be cast down throughout Creation. Under the solemn and intense eyes of Tammuz and Ma-Ha-Suchi the Chosen of the Moon are beginning their work.

The west is quiet, but there is a new wind blowing there, murmurs of hope inspired by strange dreams and visions. Small miracles provide a constant sign that change is coming, and coming swiftly.

On the Blessed Isle, darkness has begun to fall. From nowhere the forces of the First and Forsaken Lion have begun to make landfall, striking at the cities of Noble and Sion. As the ground turns black with rotting blood the grass dies, the wind grows cold, and the sun's light becomes dim and feeble. Shadow is creeping slowly north and west over the isle.

In Harborhead the webbing between Creation and Malfeas is failing, and stories of demons slipping quietly through holes of Law are circulating. For now, the tales are few and most laugh them off. More and more often, though, those laughs are half-hearted and those trying to deny the truth of affairs can feel the hair on the back of their necks stirring.

These facts are shared with the Solars aboard the Sun's Messenger. Ascendance's voice is calm, perhaps, but there are hints of alarm to be seen in the way her hands tighten on the bundle of papers she holds. "So you see, things are not horrible. I think we are still in the nick of time. If we waste time, however, it will be too late. Our enemies sense the growing weakness in Creation. The Sidereal stewardship of Creation following the Solar madness has nearly undone all our victories."

"And that is why we are going ahead in the east," says a grizzled old Sidereal. "Walker has too long stood unmolested. We'll see how he deals with the armies of the Bull and Ma-Ha-Suchi. If he is expecting to get lucky, we will teach him who governs Fate in Creation."

Ryushi listens to all this and digests it. As the ship flies, he's practicing tossing his steel sword and catching it - in front of him, behind his back, and elsewhere. He has a dangerously casual demeanor, throwing and snagging the blade by its sharp edge with just his fingertips to hold its weight. "I see. I have my business. Tanuki has his. Those affairs meet in Harborhead. For now, though, I have a god to save. Of all the four corners of Creation, the West seems easiest for me to establish a place of harmony without interference. I'll start there."

Tanuki is, if anything, even more casual, if in a more devil-may-care way, and integrates Ryushi's informal _kata_ into his own, balancing on one finger while bending his body this way and that to avoid the flying steel. "I can't take on Simeon head-on yet... or whatever it is took him over. If I gonna deal with him, I need ta train up. An' it sounds like whatever Ryushi's gonna go up against in the West'll be just about right fer that."

The sidereal watches the tossing with a bit of wariness in her eyes. After a pause, she finally says, "This seems prudent." She clears her throat noisily and explains, "I am most concerned by the news of the Blessed Isle. I had hoped it would be managable, but now it seems we must create an Empress quickly and have the Deathlord's invasion crushed in short order." She sighs and turns her head, where a roster of glowing writing appears out of thin air. She taps three names there and says, "Find a candidate, do not be picky. We can fix them later." She turns to Ryushi, "We would normally take our time in this sort of thing."

The swordsman shakes his head. "If you want to take control of the Blessed Island, you don't just need a candidate. You need to get their attention." He stops his swordplay and settles in, staring at Ascendance.

"I have it delegated to someone who has experience in this sort of thing," says Ascendance confidently. "If anyone should know how to pick a leader it's the Steersman. When we don't have Death Lords and demons breathing down our necks we can fix the mess we've made. For now, we have to prevent the First and Forsaken Lion from taking the capital."

Ryushi shrugs. "You will not hold the Blessed Island without the Dragon-Blooded," he says, directly staring at the Sidereal. "You must unite them. Nominating a leader is not enough. They must be given a reason to stop fighting."

"We'll handle it," says Ascendance, becoming a touch testy. "We have to leave the task to the Steersman for now. He will not let the situation deteriorate, and he will not allow the Dragon-Blooded to make a mess of things. If he cannot manage it with the help he has been given, I don't think anyone could. There is no one alive who knows the Blessed Isle and its people better. For us, the task remains the West."

Ryushi thinks about this slowly, then nods. "Very well."

---

With no precise guide as to just where the Solars are going, they cruise west towards The Neck. They soar north of Abalone. Ascendance says nothing, reaching out at the threads of fate in vain. There is nothing to find. For hours Meggan flies north, towards the Skullstone Archipelago.

Without warning the ship banks hard to the west and essence bursts from it. There is no sign of enemy or threat, but Meggan has certainly put on the speed, moving faster and faster, pushing the celestials firmly into their seats.

Ryushi just smiles. He has seen enough to know that when riding the rapids of Destiny, one can only hang onto one's craft.

In the midst of the collosal burst of speed kitty gracefully bounds into view, hopping into Ryushi's lap and blinking its eyes slowly as the diminutive animal gazes up at the exalt. The cat tilts its head and places a paw near the stone. For a moment, there is a faint shifting of essence and an equally faint glint of gold that connects feline and Goddess Seed.

Kitty stretches lazily and makes a show of turning around and racing up towards Meggan. In its wake bits of red and gold light rise and go dark.

About the time the Solars would guess the cat reaches Meggan the ship banks again, going northwest. The speed is still growing, and when the celestials look back the can see titanic waves rising in their wake and riding these joyous elementals, eagerly riding the currents of essence that erupt from the Sun's Messenger.

Three more times Kitty comes back to the stone, and each time the ritual is the same, and the end result the same. The ship's turns grow more severe, and with no warning there is a sudden stop. By now, Ascendance is looking almost green from the trip, and the other Sidereal is making a point of not looking her way. He cannot, however, hide his grin to any convincing degree.

Ryushi immediately gets up and heads toward Meggan, hoping to establish what's going on.

Meggan is exhausted, looking as if she had run the whole way. With the ship stopped the Celestials are aware of a great weaving of essence around them. It's shape is most like that of a vast spiderweb woven into the shape of a funnel. "It's here," she explains quietly. Ascendance hears the words and whispers gently an echo, "It's here we must be, and we must be here right now. How can it be so clear now?" Behind her the elder Sidereal snorts, "We stand now a half mile above an island that has not been in at least five centuries. That is why it can be so clear now. The only thing that is not clear is how it can be now."

"Very well." Ryushi is never one to take things halfway. He strides toward the rail of the ship and vaults over the side.

Tanuki looks around. "Ryu?" he says as the Solar warrior hops over the side. Rolling his eyes, he calls, "Wait up!" and jumps over as well. Though the Dawn caste warrior has proven to be agile in combat, Tanuki still thinks of him as the 'slow one', and he can't let the 'slow one' show him up.

Ascendance watches the Solars descend with a sigh. "Watch her and guard her," she says to the other Sidereal before she, too leaps. The old man shakes his head and turns to look at his charges closely. His eyes rest on kitty for a moment and he speaks in a tongue more obscure and perhaps even more ancient than Old Realm. "But we both know that she needs no more looking over than she already has."

---

The island below the exalts is immediately familiar to the Solars. It is the mirror image of the ruined island they had seen long before, the island that they just barely escaped alive before its guardian levelled it. Ascendance slows her fall by the Solars, wings of gossamer carrying her down. "This is impossible," she says simply. "I wonder how long the Chosen of Secrets have known that it was real," she mutters angrily. "Too many secrets."

Beyond the island, perhaps two miles to its west, is a curtain of chaos. Images of madness and the shrieks of the damned mix with haunting music and polychromatic vistas of teasingly ephemeral beauty. But above all the cacophony of light and sound - and smell, as the Solars discover upon descending further - has one voice. A shriek of impotent rage as seeks to unmake the stubborn solidity of the island called Kathay.

Ryushi soft-lands, and Tanuki leaps down with simian grace from his shoulder, thanks to the jump harness the swordsman wears. Beside them, Ascendance makes her own arrival. Ryu glances about, taking in the sights. "Some place for a celebration," he mutters.

Ascendance steps lightly, frowning as she looks around. "Kathay. The Island outside of Memory and Time is real." The Exalts do not need her to explain. In their minds they can feel the story of this place revealing itself. It is vastly ancient, and it was not built by Solars or Lunars, but by the Dragon Kings. The Solars know that this is only the fourth expedition to ever reach this sacred place from the outside, and that like those that came before, time does not pass while they walk upon these silent streets. There is nothing else alive here, but there are whispers of lore from every direction.

The Solar swordsman has learned much of combat. All battles take place in a geometry centered on oneself. Some schools teach that it is a circle; others speak of a triangle. A few heretical swordmasters talk of the spiral. But in these geometries, the flow of body and weapon is a predictable motion. The master will seek out the pattern, and adjust his fighting accordingly. This is also true of Essence, for does not Essence pervade all things? Accordingly, Ryu relaxes his body as he walks. His mind becomes aware of the hints and impressions and feelings he receives, the vague glimmerings of remembrance or warning. He fits these into a predictable pattern, seeking out the true form of Kathay that lurks behind the hoary lore of elder epochs.

Reaching out, Ryushi can sense what makes this place so important. Here the Solars stand in the very spark of Creation's soul. They stand inside the Divines in a very real way. Luna, Helios, and the Maidens are all here wound about them. The Dragons are here, as well, and they carry with them the pulse of Creation to those who can listen to its rythm. Essence is here, waiting, ready for shaping. Were the Celestials to reach out they could call upon its power forever.

In this discovery the truth reveals itself to the others. The mirroring illusion is gone. In its place the island's real shape is revealed. There are dozens of towers and temples here, all shaped perfectly in every way. The wilting that is consuming Yu-Shan has no power here. On this island, there is no stain.

Amidst the wonders here there is something that is apparently out of place. It is plain, roughly hewn stand of stone. Upon this sits a book. Its name is whispered as soon as it is seen: "Sunetos Atelestos." Just as certainly as they know the words, the Exalts know that any who read that book will be bound to it. Such a reader would have the wisdom and knowledge of the Maidens, but they will cease to be as they are. There is even a distinct impression that any who read its pages will have their star set in the skies and become a new Maiden themselves.

"This is the most dangerous place in Creation," whispers Ascendance. "The power here is not meant for us, but.. we are drawn here for some purpose. But why?" She eyes the Sunetos Atelestos with more than a bit of curiosity. Still, there is fear in her eyes that dwarfs any temptation. "I do not think I want to make that sacrifice to gain knowledge," she decides at last.

Ryushi shakes his head. "There is no need. Ascendance - I need to call a god. Saturn, or one of her attendants. This is the only possible place for it."

"If there is any place that can bring Saturn from the Heavens, this is it," says the Sidereal. "Perhaps our presence here will be enough to call her. It worries me that when I think of the stories of those that have come here none include what followed their setting foot upon this isle." She pauses and concentrates, "The island does not reveal it, either." A chill runs through her, "Could you imagine what someone like Ami could do with this much essence?"

"I'd rather not speculate," is Ryu's dry reply.

Tanuki scratches his head. "All these temples," he says. "Are there e'en this many gods?" he says in wonder. He remembers the darkened streets of Yu-shan, and the gods that were gone.

Even as the question is asked Tanuki's true thoughts are revealed. The thief finds himself drawn along a pathway to a great and silent spire. It is not a temple in the usual sense, that much is clear. Just what it is proves evasive and confusing. There are some thoughts and words that cannot be translated for mortals. The nearest guess that can be made is that this place is something like true home, or perhaps a reflection or copy, or maybe a mould.

"It's where she would be, if'n she were still with us," Tanuki murmurs, turning to Ryushi, wondering if his more educated friends can make more of it than he. "I dunno what we need ta do... but I'm thinkin we need ta do it here."

Ryushi nods. "This is where it must happen," he says. "But we're missing something. Lydia. She must be brought here."

---

The Calibration Gate can be opened, giving access to Heaven. This is one of Ascendance's more useful abilities, but not the last one she will be exercising on behalf of the two Solars. The pair watch as the magnificent portal shimmers into existence before them, words in an ancient tongue carven into the stone. Only Ascendance will go through, but her mission is clear.

The Sidereal is sent through with simple instructions: find Lydia. Find a senior Chosen of Serenity. And return with them in appropriate garb. Ryushi turns to more mundane matters.

It is not long after Ascendance leaves that the shores come alive with activity. First they come warily, alone or in pairs, but eventually it is nothing short of a procession that begins to ascend the eastern shores of the island. The forms of these spirits and elementals vary greatly, but the power of the sea is strong in them. They do not know why they have come, but the great light of the Sun's Messenger and its great power has drawn them here.

It takes some doing, but Ryushi gradually understands how to reify the threads of Essence that pervade Kathay. With some work he is able to 'find' the full complement of wedding goods, including a dress, procession animals, and incense upon the island. These things he dutifully gathers, packs, or leads back to the site of the temple.

For his part, Tanuki has been put in charge of planning the festivities, and he's going to go all out. He may not be intimately familiar with the detailed customs of Yu-Shan and divine ceremony, but by all the Gods in Heaven he knows how to throw a party. Besides, he'll have Ascendance to help him fill in the details and remove the more egregious gaffes, when she gets back. Meanwhile, these elementals will be of invaluable assistance.

The element of water covers all manner of things in liquid form... including alcohol and other libations that embody the spirit of passion. Tanuki approaches the elementals and explains his requirements; many varieties of water elemental are every bit as mischievous as he himself, having had considerable delight in watching the antics of drunken sailors in their time, have no trouble handling this to his satisfaction.

This handled, Tanuki is free to plot the ceremony itself. The procession is easiest for him to plan. Again, some of the elementals, particularly the nymphs, will be of help; they will not take to heavy-handed choreography, but then, it is not Tanuki's style to force it on them. The dancers in the procession will do far better if they are free to express their spirit as they will - especially the lead dancer, the best one Tanuki hopes to find on the island: Tanuki himself.

The vows Tanuki finds hardest to handle. Though he has something of a way with words, the fine and ornate language of Yu-Shan is not his forte, nor is he as closely familiar with Lydia, or her beloved, as he would have liked. In the end, he feels that he can only do his best: the themes of love, dedication, and companionship, though they may be strange between man and god at times, have some universal elements to them, and he draws on them as best he can. Again, he will rely on Ascendance - and, when he is ready, Lydia herself - to edit them to the narrow requirements.

It is not precisely the most graceful of entries for Lydia, but it is the one that could be managed in short order. Fortunately the guests do not witness it. It seems that she was stubbornly resisting the invitation to her own wedding for reasons unclear. How Ascendance was able to get a Lion to help her extract the squawking Sidereal may never be clear. Once Lydia's feet are planted on the ground, though, she summons the grace that suits her position, straightening out her robes and smiling at Ryushi confidently. "I'm not precisely sure what is going on, but I happily accept your invitation."

"You are being given a chance to renew your wedding vows. If you wish." The swordsman smiles. "If so, please take your position. The procession will begin soon." He points down the boulevard, where a tent flying the banner of the Dawn Caste Mark has been erected.

With that done, Ryu attends to Ascendance. "Call Saturn, the Maiden of Endings, or one of her representatives," he says. This is by no means a casual request, but his voice is calm and his eyes steady.

Ascendance laughs softly. "Right! I'll just see if.." She can see Ryushi is being serious and sighs. "You are crazy." Still, she is going to try. It is Law, and she knows it's worthless to move forward if she won't obey it just as the others must. The Sidereal turns to go with an uncertain look on her face. To those watching it is unclear if she dares do what she knows she must, but it is clear soon enough.

How does one summon the Maiden of Endings? There are a few things that come to mind. None of them seem plausible to Ascendance. Even as she finds herself wandering to the place where Saturn's spire stands she hasn't a clue. When she nearly falls off into the nothingness she is brought back from her musings into the reality of affairs.

Saturn's spire is along its own winding path, and though other spires may stand near, they pale in comparison. A void is here. Not the Void, but something else so very much like it that it causes Ascendance to stumble back in fear. "The Ending," mutters the Sidereal in annoyance.

The Sidereal begins her work in silence, weaving fate with the endless reserves of essence that flow around her. The design swiftly grows impossibly complicated, so that even Ascendance swiftly becomes lost in her work, tying greater and lesser destinies into a tapestry so detailed that she doesn't even know the full ramifications of it.

"Very beautiful," interupts a young, teasing voice. "But you missed a spot." Ascendance turns her eyes only enough to see a bare arm stretch towards her work. The hand on that arm extends its pinky in a gentle flick and the destinies fall into place. For a time, Ascendance can only stare at the digit, her breath caught, for even the least part of Venus is more beautiful than the unprepared eye can pry itself away from.

A heartbeat passes, two, three, ten, perhaps a million. Ascendance does not move, and then from the nothingness in front of her explodes the form of a titanic maiden. Saturn's appearance is not subtle this day, for this ending and the beginning it has made will resonate throughout Creation. Indeed, it already does. The maiden looks down upon Ascendance with a blank expression for a moment, her lips pursed. With a sigh of the goddess moves forward. Her every step is the stroke of doom, and the music that surrounds her is both great and terrible. Death and life are in her breath, and in her eyes is written the fate of every endeavor that has been or ever will be.

Venus follows Saturn. Serenity wears nothing but her hair today, for no gown is more beauty than her own skin. Amidst the threatening tones of Saturn the soft, gentle music of Venus weaves and darts. Love and beauty and passion may have their endings, but every time one of their melodies is quenched by the fates another harmony will spring into being.

Ascendance remains behind, frozen in place, confused and dazed by what has happened. Only when a great hand is set upon her shoulder is she roused. What she sees leaves her gaping and speechless. The one she sees says in a jolly voice, "I hope I am not late. I do so love weddings. You think they'll let me give away the brides?"

---

Ryushi's guests are a mixed lot. There is a group of Dragon-Blooded, plucked from the battlefield of the Realm's civil war. There are a confused-looking lot of commoners - formerly dressed in the rags of Harborhead's slaves, now attired as proper wedding guests. The Terrestrials are still in a daze; none have gotten as far as thinking of the Anathema yet. Perhaps it is their wounds that keep them quiet.

As the Solar sees Ascendance and her visitors, his first act is to summon Daoyang - for as a comrade-in-arms, it too must do honors. His second act is to kneel and bow his head, planting the blade firmly by his side, and wait.

Around the side of a temple comes a column of dancing water nymphs. Though each one is dancing its own dance, there is a harmony there, their individual cavorting and playfulness weaving itself into a consummate whole, arranged thus not by strict orders but by skillful and charismatic suggestion. And at their head is their choreographer, leading the procession in his best finery. Tanuki, Chosen of Helios, expresses his love of life to the utmost of his ability - but in a way that is almost unlike that of a Lawgiver, his excellence is not directed to call attention to himself. He is a player on a stage, for this day is not for him. It is for Lydia and her bride, and he is merely proud to play a part.

Behind the procession of waves comes Lydia, her head bowed and her hands trembling. Her robes have been replaced with a gown more fitting for this ceremony, and though she does her very best to act reserved, her eyes are active as she hopes to catch some sight of her bride, starting to believe in what is happening. She has hope again.

At Lydia's side is the Sun himself. It seems that he follows Tanuki's lead, so that his radiance and glory only increase her beauty, keeping every eye on the bride. When she reaches her place, Helios sets two of his vast hands upon her shoulders and kisses her forehead. He says something quietly to her that makes her laugh and smile, then he stands aside, his attention shifting to his Chosen.

The Sun clears his throat lightly and says to Ryushi, "I think there is something that still requires your attention, son."

Ryushi rises, and nods. He addresses himself directly to the Chosen of Endings. "There are two things that will find their end today. The law forbidding this act, and the current state of the goddess whose temple lies yonder." He gestures with one hand. "I ask of you, show me the edict that was written about such ceremonies."

Ryushi's answer is not an edict of paper, but a dancing of essence. She offers no opinions on his choices, but there is the briefest flicker of a smile on her lips. In front of the Lawgiver two texts float in mid-air, their words shining and very real. "Proceed as you will, Chosen."

The Solar nods. "Then by my will, and by my right.." The eye can't blink fast enough to see Ryushi's blade, charged with his own personal Essence, slicing through the construct.

The words shatter and Saturn raises an eyebrow. "Laws were made to be broken," teases Venus gently. Serenity seems to find joy in everything this day. "We have the ceremony ready but where is that bride.."

Ryushi smiles. "That is the other matter. I pray, ease the goddess's transition into a new form. She will find her way. All the necessary ingredients are here."

"Of course," says Saturn. The Maiden of Endings draws in a deep breath, and even the mortals can feel essence pour into her. Saturn arches her back and casts her gaze towards the heavens. When she exhales, there is a glow of red and gold light in the air and it rushes towards Ryushi and the stone. Venus murmurs, "Let's see the rock, handsome."

Ryushi produces it with great haste.

Venus reaches out to gently dabble her fingers in the flow of light. "So beautiful," she whispers quietly. The goddess draws her hands back and explains, "We have to let her finish." Who the other 'her' is seems unclear and the Maidens aren't explaining.

Essence is woven gently, doing the last few things that are required to shape the goddess. In the last moment the stone is plucked from Ryushi's hands by someone unseen and opened, so that the light within can be joined to the cast of essence that has been formed. With a last explosion of light the goddess is reshaped and made anew. She stands shyly in front of the guests, her arms and hair preserving her modesty.

The bride is not left naked long. A pair of giggling nymphs rush to her side, one creating a warm mist while the other dresses the goddess. When is ready, the mist is allowed to dissipate.

For his part, Ryu's work is done. Quietly he withdraws into the audience, dismissing his sword.

While the dressing is taking place Venus has a few things to attend to. "She must have a proper attendant," the goddess decides. With a playful laugh she waves a hand and Meggan stands at the goddess' side. "Hmm, yes, very nice. A good start, but we're missing something." The goddess's laughter swirls around Meggan and kitty and soon each is dressed properly for the wedding. The garments shiny like crystal and flow like water. On kitty a collar of glowing pearls takes shape and chains of silver wind about his body. "There, now we are ready."

The ceremony is presided over by Venus herself. The goddess' idea of a wedding ceremony is far more interesting, playful, and fun than anything the guests have seen before. At times, her voice is lowered for Lydia and Open Blossom, at other times she directly addresses those in the audience, teasing or suggesting things that leave more than a few people blushing, including both brides and Meggan.

When the vows are exchanged and the brides kiss, and kiss, and go on kissing, the ceremony is ended by Saturn. Of course, this is when Venus declares it the start of the wedding party. She astutely suggests Tanuki be in charge of the drinks while she helps the water spirits make the music.

During the post-ceremony celebrations, Ryushi draws Tanuki and the more powerful of the water elementals together. "It is my wish to bring the West into harmony," he explains. "I will conquer what I must, but I will not rule." His Caste Mark blazes to life, and Daoyang appears. He points first at his brow. "If this is not sufficient to convince the rulers of the West to adopt virtue and correct behavior," he says flatly, "I will use my other argument."

"Long have we waited," says an elder spirit. "Too long. We have seen what we are when left to ourselves. Our friends are dying one by one. Today, for the first time in over one thousand years, our numbers have increased. We will aid you in creating the harmony you seek. There is much we must do, Lawgiver. There are many old grievances that must be addressed."

Ryushi nods. "I will come to the West soon. The ceremony has honored four of the Maidens - an ending has happened, a journey has begun, serenity is satisfied. The secret of this place has been discovered, but will be kept. Now I must honor Mars, and finish the battle the Dragon-Blooded left behind." And feeling for a strand of Essence from earlier, the swordsman is gone.

Tanuki, meanwhile, finds Meggan and her beloved 'pet', and greets the girl with a smile. "Say, Meggan," he says, with all appearance of innocence. "Mind if I play with kitty for a bit? It won't take long." He reaches down to pick up the kitty gently, apparently as one normally would for a cat - but in fact with far greater caution than one would normally employ for a housepet.

Meggan tilts her head and smiles at Tanuki. She finds it a bit strange, but she trusts Tanuki. "Okay, just promise to bring him back. This place is very strange, and I think once we leave here we will never be able to find our way back."

Tanuki has laid his plans with care. He takes the cat behind one of the temples, out of the normal flow of the party, so that there will be some peace and quiet. He sets the cat down and leans up against the temple wall, pulling out a handful of about a dozen slingstones and juggling them idly - a virtuoso performance for a mortal jongleur, and for Tanuki, something to do with his hands while he talks. "So," he says, grinning. "When were you planning on telling us that Meg had a third Celestial protector, eh?"

The cat tilts its head at Tanuki and turns away when asked the question, busily cleaning its paw and watching him from the corner of its eye.

"Hmp. Fine, be mysterious," says Tanuki, working a shrug into his routine. "I'm just glad to know Meg weren't _totally_ on her own in Simeon's house all them years, after all." He sighs. "But if you was there any length of time at all, you had to've found out that there was more to both her _and_ Simeon than met the eye. Now that there's a hole in the sky over Harborhead, that's gettin' ta be real important. More important'n keepin yer cover. Ya don't hafta tell Meg what ya are, an' ya don't hafta tell me either, but ya gotta tell _someone_ bout what you saw there. It's the whole world at stake now, not just one cute girl." Tanuki chuckles. "O'course... Meggan's more'n just a pretty face herself, as I'm sure ya figgered out by now."

The transformation is perhaps not unexpected, but it is still dramatic. Kitty, it seems, is not a male after all, but a woman with fierce eyes. She wears rags and has a most unkempt look about her. "I have little to tell you, Solar. The Sidereal who led me to join her might have known more, but he's not going to talk much these days. I was in the House of Simeon for only a few days before you arrived. I don't know what happened to the original kitty, but it seems that the guards thought I was close enough to be forced into the house when he went missing."

Tanuki frowns, throwing one of the lead pebbles at the far wall without missing a beat on the other eleven. "Damn!" he says. "I was hopin' ya'd have somethin' we didn't. Sorry I screwed up yer stakeout, then." He shakes his head. "I'd feel better if'n I knew somethin' was gonna go down anyway. Maybe one o' the Sids could tell me. If they put you there just three days before I showed up... well, that's one o' those coinkydinks that's got Sid written all over it."

"Sorry I can't tell you more. I killed the Sidereal, so he's useless." She shrugs and sighs, "He knew I would, too. Sidereals are all insane. Anyway, it was obious that something was weird there, but I never met Simeon. If I had, I doubt we'd be having this conversation." The Lunar grumbles and asks, "So how did you figure me out? There were too many eyes on me at once, I suppose. Too many who would remember me."

Tanuki shrugs. "Well, I knew _somethin'_ was up wi' that business with the gem," he admits. "Even wi' Meg involved, that ain't normal cat behavior. But you c'n thank Ryushi fer puttin' the pieces together. He's the brains o' this outfit," Tanuki adds, grinning.

"So what now?" asks the Lunar.

Tanuki adds the shot pouch to his juggling routine, and one by one, the shot he was juggling disappears into the bag. "What now? Well, that's up to you, but... the way I see it, you been taking care o' Meg in secret for a while now. An'... well, I dunno if I can always be there for her. I..." And this time, it is Tanuki's turn to look away. "I think I'd feel better if I knew someone was lookin' after her."

"I think eventually I must tell her the truth," says the Lunar. "I like the child. There is a beauty to her that I've not seen in an age." The woman watches Tanuki carefully, not quite sure what to make of him. "But maybe you should tell her your secret first. It's not as if she hasn't a clue. She talks to Kitty quite a bit."

"What, that I'm a Solar?" says Tanuki. "Come on, she's seen us through the Messenger's eyes with our banners up a dozen times, if she hasn't figured _that_ out by..." He trails off, and blushes brightly, dropping all the remaining shot at once. "Oh."

The Lunar snickers, "You are a slow one, aren't you?" She rests her cheek on a hand and says, "You know, I'm still not sure why the Sidereal had me join Meggan. It's been very interesting, though. A lot more fun than I expected. I doubt I'd have seen a Solar blushing like a boy if I had stayed in the Wyld."

Tanuki grins sheepishly, collecting his shot. "Heh. Well, she's the first girl I ever actually _fell_ for, y'know? I partied it up in Harborhead, but... well, she's the real thing. Laugh it up if ya like, but I _know_ y'know what I'm talkin' about." He shrugs. "Let's go back to the party, eh?"

"We'll talk later. By the way, when you want to talk for real, you can call me Lilith." Before the Lunar returns to the form of kitty she adds casually, "And be careful with Meggan. If anyone hurts her, and I mean real hurt, they are gonna answer to me, then wind up like the Sidereal."
