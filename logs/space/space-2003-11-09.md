# Space 2003-11-09

The blaring klaxons from the console make a steady, if annoying, background noise. "Now look, it's obvious that you're a pretty good pilot. Now, I have no idea who you are, or who those people are coming out of spacedock, or why they're firing concussion missiles at us. But you obviously know your stuff." The voice is reasonable, fraught with certainty in a time of crisis, and its owner looks equally calm. Tall, with the somewhat emaciated build of a low-gravity spacer, with the name JACK SOUTHPORT stitched on a faded skin-suit. "So let's say you untie me from this chair, and we talk about you joining the crew as full-time pilot?"

Emily raises an eyebrow, muttering under her breath. "I guess he's not interested in a payment plan." Her dark eyes narrow, focusing on the knots. Within a few seconds she has Jack loose. "We'll talk about payment later," she says quickly. "We probably want to be somewhere else about now.."

Smiling, the spacer lets out a low, grim chuckle. "Well, let's see. We've got a third of a gravity of acceleration unloaded. We're by no means the fastest thing in space, so let's start being the trickiest..." His hands move to the console before him, punching in commands.

"Great," says Emily, "I sure know how to pick 'em." She watches Jack out of the corner of her eye, but for now she's much more focused, interested primarily in living. She curses softly, "Dalion, you useless asshole! When I get out of this I'm going to kill you!"

"'When' is remarkably optimistic," mumbles Jack, concentrated on his work. "Now, if you will excuse me, steer left please.. Keep us from getting killed for another 46 second - mark - and we'll be fine. Oh, also, umm, turn us 180 degrees aroud?"

"Pretty demanding for a runt, aren't ya?" answers Em. She first swings around left, rolling the ship past another barrage. With a sudden swing the ship whips around, as if out of control. With a grin Emily forces it to move forward, the whipping rear dragged along for the ride and pulled right back into alignment. "That's it, baby, do what momma tells ya," she whispers.

Jack whistles while he works, tapping commands into his console. "Okay. Now, umm, give us all the acceleration you can, right towards 'em. You see they're accelerating at 2 G's, probably on beamed power, and they were launched, a velocity they'll need to overcome. They're going to whip right past us, and right into the station's Emergency Traffic Zone. They have no IFF, which means the station behind... sorry, in front of us is going to start opening fire." The spacer chuckles appreciatively, apparently amused by his own cleverness. Assuming it doesn't get the ship destroyed in the process.

Em refuses to be impressed. "Right," she says flatly. "Hope you don't lose your lunch here, this is going to be rather bumpy." She draws out every drop of power she can, pushing the ship to its limit. Her eyes widen as she prepares to move, and move fast if this fool plan turns out bad.

The ship swivels about and accelerates straight towards Dalion and his gang. The craft plows through them as they move to let them past. As the ships rotate about, letting loose a barrage of laser fire that narrowly misses, they are sent into the Emergency Traffic Zone. The flares of energy weapons fire and explosions fills the sky behind the ship as it escapes, however narrowly, certain destruction.

"Aaaaaaand now," says Jack, looking at the board ahead of him, "I expect the station security chief will want to haul us in for questioning. So, a course away from here would be convenient. What's your name?"

Emily snickers softly, almost giggling as she sees so many of Dalion's boys bite it. "Hmm?" She dimly realizes that Jack is talking. "Call me Em, I guess, or whatever you want. Does it really matter? Names are kinda like clothes, anyway." She sets the course almost lazily, pausing to stretch her arms up above her head, fingers interlaced so she can crack her knuckles. "I warned them not to, but did they listen? Of course not!"

Humming, Jack glances at his new crewmate for a few moments. "Well, on my ship you'll need a standard uniform, so to speak. So I'll call you Em," he says at last.

As the two plot their course away from the station, and begin taking it, the communications unit lights , indicating that they are in fact receiving a transmission from someone.

"A uniform? What do I look like, some grunt mechanic?" replies Em. "I'll have you know that I expect a cultured and pampered life with plenty of time to relax and enjoy myself." Of course the route she plotted just so happens to be towards the nearest city she knows that has a casino. "Yes, yes, Emily is very delicate, you know. And I'm sure you can understand my situation, can't you?" She looks at the communication lights, then back to Jack. That just can't be good.

Jack holds up a hand, then engages audio. "_Fast Buck_ receiving. Go ahead." He frowns a little, curious to know just how fast this will develop.

Emily hears the name of the ship and has to bite back a laugh. She'll keep herself quiet, though. Who knows just who is looking for her, now. Gonna have to come up with another damn name most likely.

"_Fast Buck_" intones a voice that sounds as though the F and B should've been switched about, "This is Jimmy's Beam. I've a message for one of yer... ah... passengers. Emily, you swine, you," a stream of four letter words follows, ending with, "This ain't over sweetheart. You owe me three ships now." Then the transmission ends.

As soon as she hears that voice Emily blurts angrily, "Go to hell, Jimmy, you stupid ..." And at that point there's not much but an endless string of expletives. The young woman is bristling by the time she's done and her grip on the controls make it look as if she might damage them.

Jack rolls his eyes to himself. He says nothing until the transmission terminates. "That's a pity," he sighs. "But then again, one resorts to words when all else fails, I suppose." Nevermind that his passenger and now pilot has dredged the foulest vocabularies of space. "Steer us for a gate, please, and let's get moving.... I think I can forget about any shipping deals here for awhile."

Emily mutters a few more soft words under her breath that involve creative uses of various orifices on Jimmy's body. Even while she's working up such amazing thoughts she steers the ship easily on its course.

"Oh yes, I almost forgot," says Jack, cheerfully. "I'm a telepath, associated with the Mindsmen. Do you consent to telepathic contact? Of course, if you don't, I'll have your final paycheck as pilot waiting for you when we reach the gate..."

Emily grins and shrugs. (( Suit yourself )) she sends. The young woman muffles a yawn with a hand as she continues. (( Anyway, what kind of work do you do? I'm not used to flying ships quite like this. ))

Jack blinks. "Oh, well, I see," he murmurs, quite taken aback. "I'm a free trader. I own my own ship, I cut my own deals. Basically people hire me when they have something relatively portable, and need a guaranteed assurance." He frowns for a moment. "I'll make contact later. I've got to think about this.."

"Think away, think away," Emily half-sings, stretching again. "Ugh, I feel like a doormat. I really have to start taking things easy." She looks around the ship, "I don't suppose you have a bath in here, do you?"

"Sure. There's a second cabin, you can use that. Hint: look for the door without the name on it," says Jack, calmly. "Check the galley as well. And um, don't touch any of the red buttons in there, okay?"

"Oohh, red buttons?" murmurs Emily. "I could really use a good, long soak. So a trader, huh? Just how free are you?" She grins at her rather overt hint that Jack might be a smuggler.

"'Free as the wind'," quips Jack. "And like the wind, I always aim for a sale." He leans back in the chair, sighing. "I do honest business, and the reason I keep making money is because people know they can trust me."

Emily hmmss, wondering if Jack just might be the one boring man in all of space. "Honest," she says, chewing on the word as if she's not really sure what to make of it. "Most honest men I have heard of weren't very successful and none of my friends trusted them," Emily muses.

"Honesty is the best policy. It just isn't the best policy for everyone," replies the spacer calmly. "It's a very expensive policy."

"Dishonesty costs enough already," says Emily. "I almost had myself enough to get a nice ship two days ago. Just needed another good night and the next thing I know, I'm almost broke. But it's like they say, easy come, easy go." She turns to consider Jack slowly, studying him from head to toe. "I don't usually work with others," she says abruptly.

"Would you like to turn around then?" replies the spacer, quietly enough, still smiling. "There's a lot of profit in honesty. Now come on. Go take your bath. Come back, tell me about your skills. Stay with me until you've earned enough to buy your own ship. Then you can be on your own, and you won't be beholden to scum like that guy back there."

"That scum isn't going to let me go no matter what I do or pay," answers Emily. "But I'll go take that bath, and then we can talk." She grins evilly, "And don't you try anything sneaky on me, I know how some of you guys are. My uncle warned me about strange men putting cameras up in bathrooms."

"Oh, well, I'm a very ordinary and regular man putting cameras up in bathrooms. Fortunately there isn't one in here, and you can come in--" He taps his head with a finger "-- if you want proof." Jack stays reclined, folding his hands behind his head and closing his eyes.

"Think I'll just take your word," she answers. She'll slip away, going off to poke around and then take that bath. She will take her sweet time at it, too.

"So, hmmmm." Jack inspects the wreckage in his cargo bay, glancing at his new pilot from time to time. The ship is, of course, on auto-pilot now that a course to the gate has been set, and the ship's own automation will handle the mundane issues of scheduling transit through it. "Looks like... you loaded your stuff onto this cargo-skiff, then rammed it straight into my cargo bay, and wrecked it. Is that about the size of it?"

Emily answers by picking through the remains of the skiff. "Well, that's the way it goes sometimes." She pulls out a couple heavy cases that are a bit dinged-up, but not bashed completely. With a few clicks Em has them open. "Ahh, excellent, looks like my armor and my gun survived just fine." She frowns, "But where's the important stuff?" She pokes around in the remains of the skiff, gasping as she sees a suitcase half torn open. She lets out a shriek as if she were doomed only to sigh in relief as she carefully cradles what appears to be a black, diamond-dusted gown. "Ahh, thank goodness, it's not damaged!"

Jack raises a single eyebrow. "Yes, may all the gods of space be praised," he deadpans, inspecting the damage to the walls of the cargo bay. "Well, the skiff is a lost cause. I'll give you a hand moving this stuff into your new cabin. We'll stow your space armor in the locker near the bridge."

Emily nods absently, still inspecting the contents of the suitcase. "Ahh, great, the shoes are okay. I was afraid I ran out of luck there! I need to win at least fifty thousand to feel better, and now I have a nest egg. Just in case." She of course takes her suitcase of clothes, the unimportant things are left for Jack to carry (they are also a lot heavier!)

Jack eyes the packages he's been left with mournfully. "Computer, set gravity to zero point three G's," he announces, and a slow smile spreads over his face as he begins reaching for the luggage. He does spare a glance over his shoulder at his companion.

Emily squats down to pick at a bit of the debris, then stands up again quickly. Would have been nice if she heard that gravity change in time. Her attempt to stand up with a little hop turns into an prodigous leap and her landing isn't as smooth as she'd like, as her feet slip on some of the trash, depositing her neatly on her backside. Oddly, she's silent through the whole thing, only sighing as she scrambles to get up.

Jack chuckles to himself. "Yes, yes, I'll be right along!" he half-sings, gaily, lugging the suddenly more manageable packages for his new shipmate in the new, lower gravity.
