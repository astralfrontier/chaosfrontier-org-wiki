# Space 2003-11-16

Epsilon Mining Facility an Eisen Mining Company. These are the letters painted in deep black against the gunmetal grey outpost. An almost out-dated station in the Syrneth Debris Field, it remains busy, due to the salvage and mining operations. It is far removed from normal system traffic, with a single Trade Lane to ferry starships back and forth between the field and Planet Eisenfaust, a more populated, far more civilized world. Currently though, Eisenfaust is a world away, as Jack and Emily find themselves docking with Epsilon Mining Facility, having jumped into the system and received a call. It seems someone is looking for a Ship for Hire on this station.

After going through docking, they are met by one Bertram Hainzel. A mining exec with a jittery manner that would have most people recommending him switching to decaf. "Hello there..." stammers the fellow, "I hope you're here to answer my call, it's been up a while now, but traffic into the Ein system is slow these days. If you can say that things such as days exist in this accursed place." He composes himself, "But then, you must be hungry. Come, join me in the mess and we'll discuss business... if you don't mind."

Jack gestures with a smile. "Our time is yours, Mr. Hainzel," he replies smoothly, following along.

Emily looks to Jack and shrugs. She's hardly one to turn down free food. Well, most free food. Something tells her this isn't going to be fine dining, though. She'll be good and stay quiet, for now. Jack probably will like that change of pace.

The mess hall is largely empty at present. Most of the station's personnel are busy elsewhere, performing maintenance, or the like. There are a few patrons here and there, and an out-dated barbot is behind a polished hardwood countertop. Mr. Hainzel gets a seat, and though the dining is less than fine, it is edible nonetheless. "I shall be frank. I want off of this station. I am prepared to pay of course, but I must get out of here. I am headed for the Neutral Territories, but so far I've been unable to leave this... place. My cargo should fetch a hefty price where I'm going, Gaian and Earthers will both need fuel and reactor components... I presume you are capable of handling this load plus one passenger?"

"You presume a lot," says Jack, thoughtfully. "What's the obstacle to getting away, exactly?" He fishes around in the pocket of his coveralls, and presents a card - Mindsmen Membership. "My discretion is assured, if you will permit it."

Well, food is food, she supposes. Emily will just start getting her payment early and leave the boring stuff to Jack. She may be a lady, but she eats like she's been starved.

"A Mindsman? I am impressed... and I permit mental communion as well as your _discretion_ if you so desire..." Hainzel's hand shakes as he reaches for his drink, and he takes a moment to steady it before drinking. "I cannot leave due to corporate rivalry, simply put. Someone gunning for my chair has effectively stranded me here, had my ship recalled and everything!"

(( Think at me, Mr. Hainzel, )) Jack commands, telepathically. (( Think as clearly as you can about your current situation so that I can understand it. ))

Hainzel's surface thoughts are quite clear. ((I want off of this station)) His cargo is quite legit. As far as he knows anyway. He is nervous about something, and Jack's jumpsuit stirs within him a quick flash of when he received the news of his 'temporary extended stay' one that has lasted ten months now.

Jack nods slowly. (( Expected opposition? ))

Emily hmmss, half-listening, at least. "So all we have to do is get this guy out of here? Sounds a bit too easy for me. And how much money?" Not that asking or listening slows down her eating.

(( With any luck, we can be out of here before my... associate has time to realize I'm leaving. This station is out of the way enough that even gossip travels slower than light here. If they should find out... I'd expect armed freighters, likely as not they'd try and steal the cargo. )) And as he mentions this, there's a slight twitching at his left eye, and the thought of one of the miners is in his memory. He owes this miner a favor, and hopes to not have it cashed in yet.

"As for how much money," continues Hainzel, verbally this time, "I would ask what your going rate is, and we shall negotiate that. I am unfamiliar with how you... free trader types... operate."

Jack thinks carefully for several seconds. "Ten thousand," he says. "Half now, half on successful transit." Mentally, he adds, (( Where is your cargo now? ))

Mr. Hainzel nods, "Very well then. If you'd be so kind as to give me your transfer information, I'll have the chits transferred to your account." Hainzel seems relieved, though he is still quite twitchy. (( My cargo is in Cargo Bay 12, awaiting outgoing transport. I'll have some loaders sent down, do you know how to operate them or shall I have some of the men here do so? ))

Jack slaps down a disposable credit-voucher, and nods agreeably. "We'll see to it ourselves, I think. How much do you have, in tonnage and volume?"

Emily fires over to Jack (( So whats the deal? Shouldn't we see what that cargo is worth and take a cut of that? Then again, this guy looks like he's cracking. I don't usually take with loonies. ))

Jack frowns a little, not letting the mental response show on his face. (( He'd have to divulge the value of the cargo in that case. We'll get more out of him, just watch. ))

Emily hmms, poking at her food. (( Well, as long as you are sure we can squeeze him for whatever he's worth. Gotta have a bit of money to gamble up a fortune, right? ))

Jack nods slowly. "Well, Mr. Hainzel, for maximum safety aboard my vessel, I'll need an exact manifest of what you're to be carrying aboard, and its declared value."

Emily resumes eating, keeping her own position quiet. (( Very nice. Hmm, maybe we can make him buy us some real food. )) Not that she's going to complain too loudly. Not yet.

Hainzel nods, "Very well." He looks around nervously, and produces from within his jacket a smal personal computer which contains his manifest. Fuel and reaction components, the tonnage of each and it's estimated value in the expected destination. He stands to inherit a rather sizable chunk of change should he pull this off.

Jack takes a quick data-transfer to his own handheld, then nods. "Well, let's go have a tour of the ship, then," he says with a smile.

Hainzel stands, and after arranging the proper amount on the disposable voucher, motions for Jack to lead the way. "By all means... lead the way, if you would be so kind."

Emily is last to stand, stretching as she does. (( I still say this guy's nuts. )) She just tags along, letting Hainzel think whatever he wants of her presence.

Aboardship, Jack is deep in thought, and confers with Emily for several minutes, alone. Finally he re-emerges. "Mr. Hainzel, can you reliably identify which vessels moored here might be sent in pursuit of you, should we launch?"

"I think I might be able to, yes." Hainzel nods at Jack, regarding him curiously. He takes a look at the ships moored on station currently, "Well let's see, there are three, the Safe Harbor, the Gold Digger, and The Raptor. If they were ready to launch, well their captains are under the payroll of my... colleague."

Hainzel adds, "Although of the three, only the Raptor's crew is entirely aboard at present."

Several minutes are spent, as Jack and his pilot discuss and compute, program and work. "Right," he says. "Emily, moor the ship at Cargo 12, please?"

Emily does just that, "Aye, aye," she says softly. "This is going to be one amusing little trip, Jackie-boy." She wonders if this crazy little plan is going to work.

The cargo is loaded. With due formality, the _Fast Buck_ announces its departure from the station, filing an electronic flight plan - a straightforward boost toward the trade-gate - with the station's automation. A few minutes later, a communication is sent - beamed from space, it seems - by the captain of the vessel on which Mr. Hainzel is registered as a passenger. Behind him, the screen shows the far-off stargate, approaching at a fair clip. "My passenger wanted to wish you fellows a good day," he says jovially. "My compliments to your captains." And with that, the transmission is shut off. Jack sits back in his chair, fingers tapping out commands on his board as he waits for the inevitable - a launch of three ships on "faster than immediate" priority.

Seconds pass, followed by longer moments which pass. A lone ship heads for the trade lane, moving silently in the inky void of space. The flare of the lane opening up and the ship accelerating within will appear after a few minutes, and during all of this... no other ships even begin launching operations.

Emily hmms to herself. "Looks like these boys are a bunch of slackers," she murmurs. "So, shall we get on with it?"

Jack nods. "Good enough," he says, shrugging. "Emily, shall we?"

Jack hums to himself, reading his board. "Mr. Hainzel? Oh Mr. Hainzel?" he calls politely over the ship's internal communication system. "What is Gretel?"

Hainzel sounds quite confused. "Gretel? I'm sorry, I don't believe I know to what you are referring..."

Jack brings a message up for display on his board. "That," he says calmly.

Emily will hold off on departing for now. (( We going or what? If this guy's lying I say we sell him off. ))

Jack shakes his head. (( Hold off for now. We'll see what he does. ))

Mr. Hainzel looks at the message brought up, "I honestly don't know. If I had to guess I suppose they could mean the Neutral Territories, or something." His brows knit in confusion, added to the worry that has been evident on his face.

Jack shrugs. "Emily, we launch. We'll see what happens."

Emily nods and launches, getting ready to evade as soon as there's a sign of trouble. (( I hope that we don't get ourselves killed for a lousy ten thousand. ))

And so without any harassment, the ship heads for the relatively close structure of the trade lane ring. The trade lane lights up, energy streams fed in at four corners to form a shimmering circle. The ship passes through, multicolored hues form the walls of a tunnel on either side of them, and every now and again they pass through another trade ring. Outside the starry field passes by in almost a blur, the individual points of light seeming to stream past until the sight of a planet looms in the distance, and the ship is expelled from the trade lane, the end of the road reached, so to speak. It will take another two such maneuvers to reach the Jump Gate leading out of the Ein system, but these can be made with little trouble at all. At least until they reach the Jump Gate...

The suitably massive structure of the jump gate, large enough for capital ships to pass through, even, floats around the end point of a wormhole. The bright flashes of ships passing through the conduit can be seen... although of more interest are the two ships that are now approaching the newly arrived ship. One of them speeds by, though at that precise moment, the other begins powering up it's weapons and starts an easy turn. The other ship does so as well, and messages are sent to Jack's ship. Messages along the line of "Halt, stop where you are and prepare to surrender your cargo, and your passenger, Bertram Hainzel."

Jack sighs. "Should have known." He begins transmitting text messages only - "On whose authority are we being stopped?"

(( Well, maybe we can get away yet. )) Emily considers the situation carefully, trying to figure out what the odds are of surviving such a ludicrous thing.

"On the authority of Karl Garindos, Eisen Mining Corporation. I have orders here to seize all assets belonging to one Bertram Hainzel, as he is no longer to be considered an employee," is the reply.

Jack nods, and transmits, "Standby." He rises. "Emily! Hainzel! Cargo bay! Move it!"

Emily swears under her breath. (( Dammit, we are never gonna get paid now! )) She will do as told, though. (( I say we space him. ))

Hainzel runs for the cargo bay. "YEs? What is it? What is going on?"

Jack chuckles. (( We're going to. ))

Jack gestures quickly, indicating the partitions that can be extended out to compartmentalize the bay. "Dump the fuel! Spare parts! Transfer liquids out into the fuel sacs. Empty those containers! Computer, deactivate artificial gravity."

(( Hot damn, now that's more like it. )) When she hears the orders, though, she has to laugh. (( You are crazy, Jack. )) But, well, she will do it anyway. Anything to see if she can get money out of this mess.

Jack switches over to voice transmission using his handheld computer, as the last of the fuels are isolated into their transparent bioplastic bubbles. (( Mr. Hainzel - I want you to sound like you're making a mad last stand to overpower me. )) And he engages audio as he begins moving for his own space-armor. (( Oh... And I'll be charging you extra for this. Expenses. ))

"--ttention Eisen Mining! We are unable to comply! Subject is armed! Subject is armed!" Jack's voice sounds urgent. He beckons for Hainzel to chime in.

Jack adds a further thought. (( Emily, get forward, get ready to send us at maximum blast toward the gate. ))

For his part, Hainzel does his best to stay calm, and as a result his yelp of panic is within human hearing. It is followed by Hainzel's shouts of "Nein! I will never go with them! I would rather die!" And so on.... he's actually quite convincing.

Emily runs off, trying not to laugh. (( This is absolutely nuts. If we live we better fleece this guy! )) She's such an optimist! She'll park herself at the control and get ready for one hell of a hasty departure. (( Ready when you are. ))

Jack presses a few buttons on his handheld, accessing his library of sound effects. The sound of three laser discharges can be heard over the communication link, and Jack hurls the space-armor, weightless now, back toward the rear doors. He beckons quickly for Hainzel to follow him forward. Once through the pressure door, he begins transmitting instructions to the armor's computer: engage maneuvering thrusters, 0.6 Gs, 10 second burn towards a nearby starship..... Setting up angles by guesswork, Jack pauses to wipe a bit of sweat from his brow, then punches the BAY DOOR button, spacing his "cargo" - empty containers, and a vacc suit that's about to make a hopefully convincing getaway attempt toward another ship.

Emily slams the ship into motion as soon as the suit is spaced. She'll swing this bucket into motion. "Hope you boys don't mind a bumpy ride," she whispers to herself. "Let's see what you are capable of," she mutters, talking to the ship.

Jack grabs hold of Hainzel, for "down" has now become "forward" and the pressure door behind them is instead below them. The ship's thrusters are firing aft, and without artificial gravity, the free-trader and his passenger are now laying on their backs against the interior wall.

A bright burst of light is fired in the direction of the ship, a warning shot... and then the bay doors open. As the containers go flying out, sucked out of the ship along with the atmosphere and the vacc suit... the ships turn their focus from targeting the ship, to targeting the vacc suit instead. They disregard the ship for now, instead setting themselves up to haul in the cargo containers. Meanwhile the ship jets forwards at speeds far too fast to be considered 'cruising velocity'. Ahead the gaping maw of the jump gate opens up, and Hainzel squeals again as Jack and the Ship both direct him against the interior wall.

The ship slips past the mouth of the Jump Gate structure and through the glowing portal awaiting within. They are surrounded in the bright blue glow of the wormhole's tunnel as they travel through it, the ship shaking as it moves at speeds far faster than light, tunneling through the very fabric of the universe. At least that's what it feels like... and then the ship gives a shudder as it exits the wormhole on the other side, the starry field as seen from a new star system stretching out before the ship. Safety... for now, at least.

Jack sighs to himself. "Come on, let's go." Hand over hand, he begins ascending to the 'top' of the ship, beckoning for Hainzel to follow. Once in the cabin, he chuckles and pats Emily on the shoulder. "Good timing. I think we made it."

Emily laughs softly, "You can thank me later. I accept cash and jewelry, oh, and fine clothing." She stretches and relaxes, "Yeah, those idiots are lost behind us."
