# Space 2003-12-21

Once again, the _Fast Buck_ prepares to leave port. Jack has been enjoying... the comforts of the ship, the five large worth of station credit stowed away safely for a rainy day. Comfort is one thing, but pinching pennies is something the spacer is accustomed to, and he's quite familiar with the cramped accommodations aboard a starship. The airlock seals itself shut as Emily comes aboard, and Jack ambles aft to greet his shipmate.

Emily is bearing a few bags of clothes and looking torn between total joy and unhappiness. "Well, I guess it's off again, huh? Oh well, at least it wasn't a total waste to come around here. I found some of the _best_ deals in the place! And I simply must show you this new suit I have. It was simply to die for!" She is of course all bubbly about what she's purchased, and Jack will likely get a much larger report if he isn't careful.

Jack smiles and nods slowly, a vapid expression on his face. "Yeah, this place was pretty nice," he agrees, listening to the stream of discussion as he sits down in his chair and begins tapping out commands. The ship shudders slightly, then gracefully begins to glide forward through space as it leaves the outpost of civilization behind.

Emily sighs, "I suppose the miser in you doesn't appreciate how very important it is that I dress well." She explains to him, "I simply must not let down my fans, Jack. You certainly can understand that, can't you? My occupation requires that certain gifts of mine be shown off in a tasteful manner."

It only takes a few hops of the local tradelanes to arrive at the 'badlands' Jack's Mindsmen contact spoke of. The only lane running in or out of this area connects to a restricted research station, so the _Fast Buck_ is advised to exit the lane before it's final destination. The badlands themselves seem to stretch out for miles. A cloud of purples and blues andgreys swirling within the dark reaches of space. As the ship nears it, the disturbances within the cloud begin playing havoc with the ship's sensors... reducing their effective rating.

Jack is at work at his navigation board. The mission profile for the hauler has been fed into the computer, and now he's busy thinking through the volume of space ahead, putting himself in the mindset of the pilot that preceded him and guessing where the ship would most likely have gone.

Emily just relaxes, leaving that thinking stuff to Jack, for the most part. She's just going to play this by ear, and helpfully bother him with a few questions. "So umm, where is it we're going again, my dear Jack?" she asks, practically cooing at him.

Jack taps out a few more commands, then points forward on the viewscreen, as a course in green dashed lines lights up. The holographic viewport transforms the vistas of space before the vessel, presenting a projection of the course Jack suspects the other vessel of taking. "That way. Feed that in, and let's get going," he murmurs.

Emily lets out another sigh. "You really must be blind, Jack," she murmurs. She follows the course, her mind working on other ideas that might help wrap Jack around her finger.

"Not really," says the free-trader with a smile, adjusting his glasses. "My eyesight is damaged, yes, but I can see just fine with correction. You know how it happened?" Somewhere, synapses fire in his brain, and for all intents and purposes the word 'no' filters through his thoughts as the answer. Thus, he proceeds. "I grew up on an asteroid outpost. Decompression accident, you know. Almost lost my hearing, and I was in the hospital for a few days thereafter. By then I had already joined the Mindsmen, so no neurosurgery or replacement. Stupid policy, but.. what can you do?"

"Not a lot you can do," answers Emily softly. "I imagine that must've hurt quite a bit. How old were you?" She keeps her mind neatly divided between her task and the conversation, apparently having little trouble.

"Thirteen years old," says Jack. He adjusts the controls, re-checking the course projection and humming to himself. "It was pretty interesting though, and when I look back on it I'm glad it happened. Taught me a lot about vacuum safety." He smiles softly. "Helped me grow up a lot."

Piloting through the cloud, even with the frequent disruptions is easy, though as they travel deeper within the badlands, the sensors begin to get a little fuzzier, and now ghosts of objects and debris begin to show up. Either that or there really are ten ships, surrounding the _Fast Buck_.

"Interesting?" murmurs Emily. "You are a bit strange, Jack. So, hmm." She looks at the readings and shakes her head, "This place is just weird. I wonder if we'll be able to tell where the ship is before we are practically inside it."

"We should be fine," says the trader softly, watching his instruments' soft glow on the board, and on the screen before him.

"Should be," answers Emily. She rests comfortable, though, relying on her partner. So far he hasn't let her down, so she's not going to start doubting him now, even if he's _not_ trying to get her in his bed.

Jack points suddenly, zeroing the viewport in on the fleeing vessel he's just now detected. "Follow them," he commands crisply, all the while banging out commands to begin recording communications and sensors. A few seconds later he's directing the computer to replay the sensor logs of the last hundred seconds.

Emily spins the ship into motion, making a very hasty and skillful chase. She can't help but be pleased with herself. At least for a moment. It doesn't help her to recall that this ship has little more armament than a shopping cart.

The other ship, conveniently lacking any sort of indentification marks, doesn't seem to notice that it is being followed. Or more accurately, if it does, the pilot shows no signs of caring one way or the other. After several minutes or so of flight through the badlands, it sets down against something causing a large, ominous shadow in the clouds. An asteroid. Its engines power down, as do all of its systems. Save for life-support...

"Well, now what?" asks Emily softly. "We go in, gun blazing?" she jokes. She's incapable of being serious right now. Well, come to think of it, she is almost never serious.

"Adjust course," directs Jack softly. "Shut off acceleration, but maintain our velocity." He begins keying in commands, tying the ship's sensors to the drive system, directing it to fire along a random vector if weapons fire is detected. "We're going to do a fly-by and see what's up."

Emily nods and does as she is ordered. She reduces the thrust and turns the ship slowly away from the asteroid. "If they are paying attention, they'll know we're here," she says softly.

"They know that already," says Jack quietly. "Better bring up gun control on your board, too. Here we go.."

The ship lays on the asteroid lifelessly, at least to the sensors. The life support system is cut back to minimal power, and as the _Fast Buck_ flies by, it makes no signs of moving, or powering up any other systems.

"Braking orbit," says Jack, crisply. "Decelerate, we're going to see what's going on down there." He removes the linkage from sensors to drive, then focuses the ship's sensor apparatus on the crater toward which he can sense two figures doing EVA.

Emily readies the gun, waiting for the order. "So what are they doing?" she asks quietly. She slows the ship carefully, curious as to what is going on. "I wonder if they are just some smugglers.."

The two beings moving across the surface of the asteroid begin moving faster. Almost running for the crater, if such a thing can be done in space. Their feet do stick to the surface... and the slight jerk in their steps indicates an almost magnetic hold. As the ship descends, it's easy to get a better view. They are humanoid in size and shape, and as they run for the crater, the two aboard the ship will notice the way parts of the rock seem to be sliding open as if anticipating the two running figures.

Jack watches the display slowly, frowning. He turns to his shipmate, nodding after several seconds. "We should hail them," he says. "If they're hostile, there's very little we can do against them anyway. If they're neutral, we can negotiate. What do you say?"

"Sounds good to me, and at this point, we've got all the cards, right?" suggests Emily. She grins to herself, "And maybe we can get a cut in their action."

Jack dutifully transmits his prerecorded hail, and waits for a response.

The vacc-suits respond by climbing down into the crater. Now that the rocks have parted, and the ship's sensors can scan it, it becomes readily apparent what they're doing. Trying to switch ships. Without getting killed.

Jack smacks his forehead a couple times with one hand, eyes shut tight in frustration. "Follow, or check out the ship.. argh.. " He comes to a decision quickly. "Em, get us in there, block 'em off."

"Should I give 'em a few warning shots?" asks Emily. "I think I can probably miss them a few times without too much trouble." She grins and winks at Jack, ready to fire when ordered.

Jack shakes his head quickly. "No, not yet.. they're hiding, not fighting."

Smiling, Jack suddenly bolts out of his chair, running for his equipment locker. "Em, match velocity with their new ship!" he shouts, as he grabs hold of a radio-beacon from the storage area. Pulling the mask of his skinsuit over his head, he seals and pressurizes the skin-tight vacc suit while tensely observing the position of the _Fast Buck_ on the board. Once the numbers line up, he grunts, then vanishes - quite literally disappearing into thin air. The sensors register him a hundred yards away from the ship. Then two hundred. Then three hundred.

Emily will match the speed as ordered, trying to keep herself ready for Jack. She mutters softly to herself, "This is completely crazy." She will take over the sensors, waiting for something to happen..

On the asteroid, the skinsuited figure quietly slaps the transmitter onto the hull of the ship, letting the molecular adhesives do their best. He spares not a moment, darting back through the void using his powers of mind. There's a soft sound as he materializes again in the cargo bay, and he rushes forward towards the bridge, stripping off the mask of the suit as he goes. "Emily, we have a beacon on them! Set the sensors to track it, and set us down!"

The ship takes off from the asteroid, speeding away rapidly. The sensors can track it easily, as the freighter is moving away from the asteroid in pretty much a straight line. All is silent on the asteroid now, save for the blip of instruments within the _Fast Buck_.

Emily grins as Jack returns, "You are so pushy, geez!" She lets out a sigh, doing just as Jack orders. "You could at least be more polite with your commands, Jack. I'm not a slavegirl." Even now she has to screw around.

"Oh, I'm sorry, Em. PLEASE help me make some money," grins the trader, eyeing the remaining vessel. "Alright. I'm gonna go check out that shuttle. Sit tight, please, unless you really want to go along. But I'd feel safer with one person at the controls."

Emily nods, "I'll just stay here, fretting and worrying for you." She relaxes in the seat, but keeps a close eye on the sensors, all the same. "I don't suppose I have time to slip in a quick bath?"

As Jack teleports over to the other ship, he will have no trouble spotting the not too well hidden form of the figure huddled near the main controls of the shuttle. Nor will he have any trouble seeing the soft green glow of the figure's weapon, which is pointed right at him.

Jack puts his hands up slowly and smiles. "Hello," he says, trying in the lingua franca of space. "I am not a threat."

"Yeah and give me one good reason to believe that..." replies a decidedly male voice, and a nervous one at that, "Who are you? What are you doing out here?"

"My name is Jack Southport," says he, still smiling and holding still. "I am on a rescue and salvage mission. I'm associated with the Mindsmen. I sent a radio hail earlier, which you must have received."

"Yeah I heard it. Didn't believe it. Never believe prerecorded messages. I'm sure you know why. Rescue and Salvage mission... yeah..." The fellow pauses a moment, and asks, "So what will it take to get you to go away from here and forget all about this, Mr. Mindsman? All you psykers have your price, isn't that it?"

"I won't forget about it, but neither is this any of my business." Jack smiles a bit, his hands still raised. "My purpose in investigating was to find out if you knew anything about the ship I'm trying to find. If you have any information, I'd appreciate it. If you don't, I'll be on my way. Either way, I really don't care who you are or what you're doing here. Is it a deal?"

Emily will just chill out for now, and ponder the accuracy of this tub of lard's weapon system. "What a mess," she mutters softly. "I just can't let you go for a second without seeing you get in trouble."

"Yeah... okay... deal..." He has yet to set his weapon aside, but it's no longer pointed right at Jack's head. "So let's talk."

Jack lowers his hands, and nods. He begins by reciting the ship's registration, make and model, then briefly detailing the course he expected it to have taken. "I'm prepared for eight crew-members, plus whatever else I can take away. That's as much as I know."

Emily just listens to Jack do the whole 'saving his skin maneuver' and sighs, still ready to open fire if something wild happens. She can't help but wonder what this strange is really up to.

"Okay. Yeah we had sensor contact with that ship. It was heading away from us pretty fast... uhm," he gives the last course and heading he knew. He taps a button, projecting a holographic navigation display of the area, and as he speaks he indicates parts of the map, which light up at his touches. "We lost sensor contact with it around here... but if you ask me, at that speed, and on that course, it's probably stuck somewhere in the heavy zone. Here. Now... is there anything else..."

Jack shakes his head. "No, that's good.. heavy zone?"

"Yeah. It's where the disruptions are the worst. The heaviest."

Jack is undaunted. "Disruptions? I'm not familiar with this area of space."

"Yeah. Unless your sensors are better than ours, you've got reduced efficiency in this part of space, right? It's from the ionic discharges. Wreaks havoc with systems. And in some places, tears through hulls."

"Ah-hah," says Jack slowly. "Alright. I'll stay alert. By the way, your two friends are heading out on a ship. I put a radio-transmitter on the hull, starboard aft. I imagine they'll want to pry it off whenever they get a chance. Now if there's nothing else, I'll be going," he adds delicately, eyeing the weapon.

"No, nothing else. Good bye." The guy waits until Jack exits, weapon indicating the door. Although Jack's likely got his own way out of this predicament.

Back on the ship, Jack shakes his head as he again makes his way forward. "They're downright suspicious," he mumbles. "But I at least got confirmation of a heading." He taps his acquired information into the navigation system, then sits down heavily in his seat. "Let's get going. Fly carefully."

As soon as Jack is gone, the other ship powers up all systems. It takes off like a rocket, moving faster than the freighter or the cargo hauler are capable of, easily. The ship's sensors will pick up the message informing them of the tracking device... but there is no further trouble from them. Yet.

Emily snorts at Jack, shrugging. "Well, whatever they are doing, it hopefully doesn't concern us." She will head on into the great wild, and wherever else Jack indicates. "So.. what's the plan for us, anyway?"

"The plan is not to get killed by ionic disruption," says Jack with a wide smile. "I trust you. But I'm still keeping a close eye on the readings here."

The ship shudders, and instrumentation flickers as the power distribution through the vessel is interfered with. The ship's engines twitch and fire at random, as a particularly troublesome wash of charged particles blows its way around the vessel. Jack frowns, cancelling a pair of alerts on the console, while Emily does her best to rein in the bucking craft.

Emily mutters softly, "Dammit, flying like a rookie!" She narrows her eyes, trying to get this ship back under her control. "Don't you fail me now, you clumsy oaf," she whispers, meaning the ship.

The free-trader stares at his instruments as the _Fast Buck_ continues its way through the badlands. Finally he points. "Over there.." The sensors are fitful and uncooperative, but Jack indicates two signals whose general profiles seem to match the ship they've been sent for. "About two miles apart. We're going to get closer and see if we can resolve a visual."

Emily nods to Jack, setting the course and making her way closer to the ships. "I hope we don't get killed in here, Jack. I'm not dressed for it."

At Visual Range, both ships that seemed as though they could have been candidates are still viable targets. They are of similar make and model, though both show signs of heavy damage. The third ship on closer inspection is a rather large sized chunk of some other kind of ship. The point where this had been torn from the hull made painfully obvious. As the _Fast Buck_ moves closer, the sensors on the ship will pick up faint powersigns coming from both ships, and what appears to be an automated distress signal from one of them.

Jack interrogates the computers of both ships for several minutes, sometimes via typed commands, sometimes speaking directly to them. He frowns, collating the data on his display, until: "Alright, let's dock with that first ship over there."

Emily nods to Jack, "I'm on it." She'll get the details later, she hopes. For now,s he's just following orders. "So if we're after only one of these ships.." That means there are freebies here!

Docking is easy. The docking hatch has remained intact, luckily. As has the hull, in most places. The two ships communicate with one another, and when they have established that it is now safe for the humans to board, the docking doors open, and Jack and Emily can step in. The ship is darkened, most of it's electricty out. And ambient temperature is less than what it should be. Every now and again, the darkness is shattered by the crackle of electricty arcing from one damaged terminal to the other.

"Must not be too badly shot, if it's got enough juice to keep throwing sparks around," notes Emily. "Did they specify exactly what we need to save from this mess, or what?" She should really pay more attention to that kinda thing..

Jack checks the report on his personal computer, reading the display on the HUD of his space-armor's helmet. "Not exactly, no.. but we have a pretty good idea," he says.

After a brief scan of the ship's interior using his own equipment, Jack gets to work, cooperating with his shipmate. Quickly as possible, he begins mating cables together, tying his own vessel's power plant into the electrical harness of the crippled hulk to restore at least partial power.

"This place is a real mess.. any chance we might tow it?" asks Emily. She considers the structure of the ship, "Probably not, I suppose. It'd be so much easier, though, honestly."

"It's possible," replies Jack, as he huffs and puffs in his armor. "I'd rather she get home under her own power, obviously, but we'll do what we can. Before any of that, though, we have to find out what happened with the crew."

"How long has this thing been here, anyway?" asks Emily. "If it's been a while, I'm afraid they're going to be a mess. If they even survived. Must've been quite the little firefight that landed them here, huh?"

The best Jack can do is restore the emergency power to the system. Dim lights come on, filling the room with an eerie glow. Three dead bodies, uniforms singed by weapons fire, lay near one of the consoles.

Jack sighs softly, directing his multiscanner over them, recording genetic data for verification. "Let's see if there's anyone else," he says in a quiet voice.

Emily nods to Jack, helping out as best she can in the seemingly hopeless search for life on the wreck. "It's kinda sad, isn't it? All lost here, and no record, no nothing.. I wonder if anyone is looking for them besides us? If anyone is missing them."

Jack reviews the sensor logs for several minutes, sometimes speaking and other times typing on an undamaged console. Finally he smiles. "These three aren't who we're looking for," he reports. "Let's get them back aboard and bag 'em up for analysis."

Emily nods to Jack, "Nothing like dragging stuff around." Especially stuff like this. "You know, I'd rather we just stayed in New Rome, they had some really nice tables and they treated a lady right."

"We can go right back there if you want," says Jack, examining the damage as he speaks. "We probably will, anyway. Tell me, what is it you like about gambling?"

"Winning," answers Emily, her grin spreading. "And it's just fun.. the risk, the trickery, it's hard to match. And I get to do it all while I'm in my best outfits, too! And the drinks are free, to boot."

Jack meditates on this for a moment, considering how much of a gamble the current mission is as well. "I guess I can understand," he says, starting a download of the ship's memory to his own vessel. "Let's visit the next one, and see what we can see."
