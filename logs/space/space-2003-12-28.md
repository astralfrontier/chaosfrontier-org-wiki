# Space 2003-12-28

Boarding the second ship is a bit trickier than the first. While the docking port has remained intact, the mechanism is fried beyond recognition. The computer interface works, somewhat, and with a little creative programming the ship is accessed. It's not qutie as dark as the other ship, as power still runs through most of the decks. As the two proceed further into the ship, the sound of energy weapons discharging echoes throughout the halls.

(( Doesn't sound very safe here, Jack. )) sends Emily in the understatement of the year. (( I'm thinking it's time we figure out what exactly is going on. Or do we shoot first, ask questions later? ))

Jack shrugs, reviewing the computer link for a few seconds before accessing it again. (( Distance and surveillance are our allies for now.. let's see what we can see. ))

(( So we have any idea who might be doing this, or why? )) asks Emily. She's going to get as ready as possible for a fire fight. (( You also have to tell me just whom I am supposed to shoot and whom I cannot. )) She's very formal in these kind of dealings.

(( I'll let you know in a moment, )) replies Jack as he concentrates.

The internal sensor feed, though grainy, still works in most areas of the ship. After taking a moment to reconfigure the power allocation, a visual image is projected of the fire fight. In what must be a cargo bay, it looks like there are four humanoid figures, doing their best to take cover and return fire at two robotic assailants.

(( When it's boys against the robots, I always tag the machines. )) Emily looks at the screen, seeing if it's anyone she might know or recognize. Not bloody likely. (( So now what? ))

Jack chuckles. (( I.. hmm, I'm starting to get an idea. Heheh. Come on.. ))

Jack winds his way through the ship. It's strewn with ruined bits of deck plating, torn up system terminals and other assorted debris. This ship has three different cargo bays, and the one they are in is the only one with it's interior door open. As Jack moves in position, Emily can easily bring the Fast Buck around, lasers glowing a deadly red. Meanwhile, the sounds of fighting grow a little more intense. One of the humans taking a shot to the arm, from what Jack can tell.

(( Attention, )) transmits Jack, to the wounded being he can perceive. (( Outer doors opening. Incoming laser fire at the robots. ))

Jack crouches near the internal doors to the cargo bay, sweating in his own space-armor, having dogged down the internal pressure doors as he passed them. The loss of atmosphere should be localized at best, and he's ready to close the cargo bay doors the moment it becomes practical.

Emily swings the ship into place, moving the machine with the lazy ease that years of practice allow. "That's a good little boy," she whispers to the ship, settling it right in front of the cargo bay doors. She'll have that gun fired up and ready, it's just a matter of getting a target.

The wounded being shouts something back at the others. The hum of magnetic boots attaching themselves to the ground directly precedes the loud whirring of the doors opening. As they open, the interior door to the cargo bay slams shut, safety mechanism still functioning, evidently. The two robots fire away, neither group terribly affected by the atmospheric release.

Emily narrows her eyes, pulling off a shot. "Stay," she murmurs to herself, watching the first robot reel from the impact of the blast and lie still. She already is working on taking the next shot, eager to put both of these robots into the trash heap.

The other robot shows no sign of surprise as its comrade bites it. It takes off, literally, thrusters anchored to its legs give it a sudden burst of speed that takes it straight under the ship, putting a rather large hunk of metal between it and the _Fast Buck_.

Jack keys in commands hastily, sealing the external cargo doors from his computer. He waits impatiently for the internal door to open, then lumbers in, hands outstretched. "I come with peaceful intentions," he announces loudly, once the cargo bay repressurizes around him.

Four guns are trained on Jack as he walks into the cargo bay. That he has his hands up and announces his peaceful intentions is likely what keeps said weapons from firing. One of the vacc-suited beings calls out, "Who are you? What do you want with us?"

"Jack Southport, Mindsman, assigned for rescue and salvage on a transport in this area," replies the spacer, smiling. "I am unarmed."

One of the vacc-suits, a different one this time, responds. (( I am a Mindsman as well. Thank every god you're here... )) Then verbally, "It's okay guys... if he is who he says he is... we have a way out of this place..."

One by one, Jack transmits via thought, repeating his identification and mission directly to each mind. Finally he lowers his hands, and smiles. "There's apparently a third ship near by - we've checked one out, and this was number two."

Meanwhile, outside of the ship, as Emily brings the robot into her sights, it points one of its limbs deeper into the heavy zone, and a split-second later a message is transmitted. Emily can pick it up... though it seems to be nothing but gibberish and nonsense and static.

Emily speaks into the radio, "Jack, we may have a problem. I think the second one just sent for help. Got a scrambled message from that thing before I shot it down." She spins the ship back, ready to settle it near the cargo bay, since that area seemed to still be in one piece. "We have to get out of here, Jack."

These four are the only remaining survivors. From what can be ascertained, two are from one ship, the other two from the mindsmen's ship. All four are quite willing to survive and be rescued, which explains their willingness to move on board Jack's Ship. The brain, and the 4 crewmembers are aboard now, and the wrecked ships pushed gently into magnetic disturbances, as the _Fast Buck_ and its crew bravely take cover behind some of the larger asteroids in the area.

"So just what are we going to do besides wait around to get attacked?" asks Emily. "And do we know why these guys were attacked in the first place?" And more importantly, do we know if those guys are cute and rich? She doesn't say that, though. Just thinks it.

"We're gonna get the drives operational," answers Jack quietly, tinkering with his electronics tools and the robot brain. "Then we're gonna take those two ships back with us, report, and get someone with guns to come out here next time."

The survivors make their recording of what had happened in the days before their discovery and subsequent rescue. Reviewing this recording reveals that none of them were terribly high in respective rank, and their reasons for the pursuit and escape attempts are sketchy at best. "We were attacked by pirates it looked like" explains one of the Mindsmen, while one of the others explains, "Our cap'n said to take these guys out, they had valuble cargo, supplies, we were gonna take 'em back to base. At least that's what he told us. Dunno why he was usin' such deadly force though..."

While the others work, Jack has his own project - summarizing and analyzing the robot brain's own log of events, its memory of what took place, and whatever instructions it may have been given, and by whom. He keeps his own computer isolated from the ship's network for the duration, having taken precautions against counter-intrusion software of both physical and electronic nature.

And while that's going on, Emily is debating whether any of the rescued men are worth flirting with. Decisions, decisions. Nah. They simply aren't very cool if she had to help rescue them.

A brief analysis of the robots log yields the following. It had been activated one day ago, and sent into space on its own power. It knew precisely where to go, and was given the instructions to eliminate any life forms it encountered on board, and to recover intact some item of the Mindsmen cargo, though what it is, is difficult to tell. As for who gave the instructions, the robot recognizes the instructions as being inputted from Terminal 4, by the programmer Delek Thall. And of course as this is going on, the precautions Jack has taken are well-rewarded, as the robot brain does NOT hijack the ship.

After a few hours, Jack puts his work away, gathering Emily and the four guests into the cargo bay for a brief, but hopefully productive conference. He doesn't open with much politeness. "We're running silent and drifting at a slow pace," he reports. "So far, we've got no sensor contacts, and the computer'll report one if it happens. So what do people want to do now?"

Emily stretches and lets out a sigh, "Well, I was thinking of taking a bath, actually. And maybe get into something more comfortable." And one probably has a very hard time knowing if she's kidding or not..

"I wanna get out of here..." muses one of the four... guests... "As soon as we can. I don't care about the ship, or anything... I just wanna go home."

"I think we can get the drives working. We need more tools, but it looks like you've got what we can do. If any more of those guys show up though... I dunno what we'll do. It's a risk... but one I'll take if you want." Offers another of the guests, this one the same mindsman that had telepathically contacted Jack earlier.

Jack smiles and rubs his hands together. "Alright. We're going to get to work on salvage #1," he announces. "We'll move the bulk of our gear over to it, with a space-line bridge between the two ships. In case of emergency, everybody will move over to the _Fast Buck_ and we'll do what we can. Our priority will be the drive system and life support. After that, salvage #2 is all mine, and you guys can head back with whoever you choose to carry. I am not letting this one get away.."

Emily just listens in, hoping that maybe Jack will be kind and give her a really nice cut. It's more likely that one of the pirates will be insanely rich and give her millions just because of the dashing rescue. "Whatever you say, Jack," she says, sounding like she's not been paying much attention at all.

Jack coughs. "Oh yeah, and you'll be reporting to Emily here, using her new title, 'Queen of Known Space'."

Emily raises an eyebrow and looks at Jack. "Well, if you want to be formal," she says, grinning widely. "I could get used to that title. But why just known space?" She really ought to just be the queen of everything, right?

"Oh, so you ARE paying attention," retorts Jack with a smile. "Fine. Anyone have any objections to this?"

"Not from me, anyway," says Emily. "Does this mean I can't take a nice, long bath, though?" That would really bother her! And hopefully they don't expect her to, you know, do anything that might make her sweat.

"No, I don't have any objections," says the Telepath. The other crewmembers give their assent, with the male pirate adding in, "Your Highness," and a wink towards Emily. "So we go salvage #1 first? Let's get cracking..."

Emily will just let the boys do the work, she's going to go find a nice place to take a warm, relaxing bath. And ponder ways to make Jack be very generous with her.

Emily will not just do this, though. She has a plan, and since Jack is a man, after all, he must respond to the normal things a man would. And so, before she even gets out of the bath, she is going to call him from his work and back to where she is.

Jack responds to the call, of course, making his way throgh the center corridor of the ship and knocking on the shower/bath door. "What is it?" he calls through the door.

And of course Emily will open the door at that point. And of course she's going to make sure she's slinkily prepared for Jack to see her. So when the door opens, Jack finds her in without a suit on. In fact, she's only wear the little frilly lingerie that she wears under the suit. "Oh, dear," she murmurs softly, a blush coloring her cheeks. It's an accident, obviously!

Jack turns away, rolling his eyes a bit. "Yes, what is it, Em?" he asks.

Emily pouts at Jack, seeing his expression. "It's not very nice to look that way at a woman who is trying to be kind to you, Jack. You really should appreciate things more." In other words, he's insulted her, and she looks suitably annoyed with him, and rather disappointed. "What, do I look fat?" she asks, going off on a tangent. "I can't believe it, I really can't."

Jack sighs softly. What now? "Okay, what am I supposed to appreciate?" he asks calmly, using his trader's training. This is just another negotiation, right? "Did you dress that way on purpose, and call me down to see you here?"

"You're serious?" murmurs Emily. "Did I just get in the ship of the most clueless man in all of space?" She sighs softly and combs a hand through her hair, "I guess it's a lost cause, there's no way you are going to get it. Don't you find me even the least bit attractive, Jack? Might as well just say it, though it's rather obvious at this point." Her not so delicate sensibilities are horribly offended by the very concept of a man resisting her. No, not resisting.. not even knowing that she's trying!

And before Jack has a chance to answer, the sensors go off. Something has been detected at extreme range, moving towards them. Directly towards them. Sensors that have been patched together from the salvaged ship detect it as well, and the Telepath chimes in on the radio, "Hey are you guys pickin' up what we are?"

Jack hmms? "No, what?"

"Looks like a ship moving towards us..."

Jack sighs, shaking his head. "Later," he says pointedly, to Emily. "Let's get going. Hopefully they won't spot us."

Emily sighs and darts past Jack. She won't try that again! She won't even be taking the time to get properly dressed, she's getting to the controls of this ship! The niceties can wait until later.

Jack examines sensor readings for several seconds. "Okay," he announces at last. "Rig for towing. We'll sacrifice salvage #2 if we have to."

Emily nods to Jack, but isn't going anywhere. She'll just stay at her post, looking somewhat less than the formal Queen of Known Space. For the moment, anyway, the perceived insult is pushed away. Jack must just hate women. Yeah. That's probably it.
