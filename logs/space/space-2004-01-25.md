# Space 2004-01-25

Once the _Fast Buck_ and its sister-ship are within range of the gate, and safety, Jack proceeds aft, checking up on his Suspended patient, then to the cargo bay. There he examines the box carefully, reviewing the mixture of impressions and images for a few seconds. Taking a deep breath, he opens the box.

Waiting for something reminiscent of Pandora's Box is Emily, who lets Jack have the honors. She'll stand bravely nearby (well, within 20 feet or so) and watch. She waits to offer Jack some last minute words of encouragement and then run the other way, should trouble pop up.

There's a soft white light emanating from the insides of the box, which illuminates the escaping condensation quite nicely. With a chilly hiss, the foggy haze of cold air clears away, and left inside the box is a small grey pod, almost silently humming away.

The pod, bathed in the soft light of it's container, is adorned with several monitoring systems, likely as not set up to monitor the conditions of the occupant sealed within the tube. An infant, in peaceful rest lays within, sleeping,undisturbed by all the commotion.

Jack hunches over. "Huh," he says, noncommitally. "What's this about?"

Emily watches Jack for a while. Since he's not dead, she guesses it's more or less safe. She sneaks up, "What is it?" she asks. She's still not getting close enough to see herself, otherwise she'd be wondering if a bomb might have been better.

"It's a baby," replies Jack, staring curiously. "In a really, really small freeze tube. Is this what the whole business was about?"

"This is getting pretty darn weird," says Emily. "Any sign of whose kid this is?" She moves closer, to take a look and hrms. It's clear that she's not too happy about taking a baby on board. "Kids are rotten luck, Jack."

Jack nods in complete agreement, thinking hard for a few moments. "We've got to go back to New Rome first. This we gotta call in. After that...." He pauses, thinking quickly and mumbling to himself.

"I wonder.. you think this kid is some kinda special psi-baby or something?" asks Emily. "There's got to be some reason you'd go through all this just to store a baby."

Jack rises quickly. "Okay. Let's get going." Carefully he repackages the box. "Yeah, there is a reason. But I don't want to poke at this too hard, you know?"

"It's really hard to get a good price for saving someone if you don't know what their value is, Jack," says Emily. "Or maybe we should just ruin the plans of them all by handing the kid over to an orphanage without a word.."

Jack chuckles softly. "Hey, you know that ship we're towing?" he remarks. "There's some highly illegal ECM/ECCM gear in there. The whole suite itself is probably worth something like seven hundred fifty thousand. Not to mention whatever else may be on board. I'd say that's our payment, wouldn't you?"

"I suppose, but depending on what this kid is.. that may be chump change," answers Emily. "Who knows, maybe the rightful parents are loaded and need some help lightening their financial burden." She sighs a little and stretches, "Anyway, let's sell what we can and get this over with."

The trip through the jump gate's wormhole is easy enough. A simple passing from point to point in space, with the customary pyrotechnical display of starlight and other such things racing by at speeds almost too fast to see, while encased within a cloud-like glowing tunnel. Exiting the wormhole is also without incident. The tradelane ring hovers in space, lit up every now and again by it's transponder beacons. All seems well... for now.

Although, 'for now' has an infuriating way of changing rather suddenly. Just as the _Fast Buck_ and its sister ship travel down the tradelane towards New Rome, Jack will note the unusual number of sensor contacts coming within range all of a sudden. A second scan confirms this. Many of them. Military ships, heavily armed. Even a Capital Ship has made its presence known near the station. Something's not quite right...

Jack directs Emily to cut thrusters to station-keeping, once his ship and its companion are out of the way of the gate. He starts scanning the communications network, checking for any broadcasts or other information sources regarding the current situation.

Emily does as directed, waiting to see whatever it is that can be seen. "Great, I suppose this means I won't get to have any fun at all," she mutters. "Like I said, bad luck. Even frozen kids in a box are bad luck."

Though most of the standard communication channels are offline, jammed, or monitored by the military ships, Jack knows his way around a comm-network. Here and there, piggy-backed on automated transmissions recording status and ambient temperatures and so forth, are broadcasts of information. Evidently the Earth Army has seized temporary control of New Rome, declaring a martial emergency. Many people have been rounded up and arrested, still more are being questioned. Ships are being allowed to leave the system after inspection. Several pirate types operating in the area have been smuggling people out of sector. And there's even a message for one Jack Southport...

Jack frowns, reading it.

It's the same woman he'd spoken with aboard New Rome itself. 'Jack, things have escalated to a level beyond our current capacity for control. If you get this message, leave the system. There is a rather tightly encrypted set of coordinates for where they might meet up. If she is not there, one of the Mindsmen will be there to meet him.

Jack lets out a long sigh, and tags the message, 'sliding' it over to Emily's console. "Read this, and head where it says, I guess," he mumbles, shaking his head. "But you're right. These guys better be damn grateful for this."

Emily nods to Jack and sighs, readying the ship for another trip. "They better just pay us, I don't care if they are grateful or not," answers Emily. "This is a lot of yank-around for the messes we've already dealt with, don't you think?"

Emily raises an eyebrow, making Jack's ship (which she still is a bit leery of) perform as few others could. The passage is made with ease, nobody will even know that this ship was ever here, in all likelihood. Even though Emily is one to toot her own horn, for once her concentration spares Jack her self-declaration of superior talent and lack of fitting wages that would inevitably follow.

It is easy going from New Rome through the transit sectors. Two stations, Freeport 3, and Freeport 9 watch the two ships travel by with little interest. And the jump gate leading into the next sector of space looms ahead. Just as the _Fast Buck_ exits the wormhole, it's hailed. The ship doing the hailing is identified as the _Sleeveless Ace_. Of more interest though, would be the person behind the hail. One James Dalion...

"Ah hell," mutters Emily. "Looks like the luck has run out again," she adds. She is already getting ready to fight. "This is why you should've put some guns on this toy boat," she adds, annoyed by this unpleasant situation.

Jack says nothing as he responds to the hail.

"Welllllll if it isn't my old friend Emily." A pause as someone whispers something along the lines of 'and soandso' "and Whatshisface... and right in my sights too. A prettier sight t'er never was. I reckon I've got th' drop on ya. So NOW who's the best pilot, eh, Em?" Jimmy is gloating, though the lummox is rather unable to hide the fact that he's about to ask for something.

"You see the ship behind us?" asks Jack, calmly, over the communications link. "In a few minutes, its owners are going to come through that gate, and be looking for us, because we're being paid to salvage and/or repair what we can. They are better armed than you are, I'm quite sure. You can find us after we're done with this deal, if you insist."

"Hmmm. Well now, no sense wastin' time with the pleasantries." That's Jimmy's reply, at least after a small outpouring of expletives. "I've got a favor to ask, and since Emily owes me so much... and it looks like you could use a little help yerself... perhaps we ought to work t'gether..."

"Make it quick," replies Jack curtly. "You better get going soon, I don't want to have to explain who you are when we're asked who we talked to."

"Alright. It's simple enough. My boys are bein' detained-unfairly of course-on one of the moons. I need someone to help me get in and get them out. I was about to head off in search of some recruits, when the Universe brought me the two of you."

"We might be able to help," says Jack. "Now, clear out, please." He sighs, sitting back in his chair and wiping his brow with one hand. "Meet us back here in 24 hours. It's a guarantee. If you know my reputation, that should be good enough. If you don't, ask around. But I assure you we'll be here."

"Well alright then." With that Jimmy's ship turns about, heading back towards the station. At a rather fair clip as well...

Emily turns a rather dark look at Jack. She just shakes her head. (( A deal with Dalion? Too bad, Jack, I was just starting to think you had something upstairs. Unless you mean to bring back a real ship and blow him out of the sky. )) She rather doubts that.

Jack cuts the relay, and laughs out loud. "Hah! That was great," he guffaws. "Now, assuming that message was authentic, let's see if anyone's waiting for us?" He turns to the side, regarding his pilot, with a sudden frown. "I don't mind a bluff, but we'll be here, just as I said. Still.."

"Still what?" demands Emily. "You just cut a deal with the man who robbed me of everything that meant a thing to me, Jack. If you expect me to help him, you are a fool. The first chance I get, I will see him dead."

Jack waves a hand. "All I said was that we'd be here. You have twenty-four hours to plot his death, if you want," he says gruffly. "However, it's better than ten seconds, right?"

Emily snorts, "We have a ship, he could have ten times our number next time. Jimmy doesn't believe a fight is fair unless he's assured an easy win. He doesn't gamble unless he has a gun to your back or a relative of yours stuck on a bomb somewhere. Let's just get this over with." Emily just turns in on herself, plotting how to deal with Jimmy and his gang.

Jack steeples his fingers for a moment. "It's not really ethical for me to intervene in a certain way, but if he submitted..." He frowns, and shrugs. "Anyway, we have time to plan too. So let's see what's waiting for us."

It will be some time before the other ship makes itself known. It too is travelling at a fair clip. The sensors can plot it's course back to one of the four inhabitable planets in the system. The ship is hailed once more, this time it's Jack's contact. "Jack... is that you?"

Jack returns hail. "Sure. Myself, my pilot, and umm, two more."

"Two more?" The woman sounds quite puzzled. "Were there no more survivors?"

Emily just kicks back, letting Jack do the talking. As usual, she doesn't look very happy about it.

Jack hems and haws. "Well, umm, we got one ship up and running, and they took off before us..We have one guy who's pretty well messed up, and someone who won't be walking and talking for awhile yet, from whom we got a chilly reception. Does that mean anything to you?"

"I was wondering what had happened to our ship. You have one guy who's messed up you say? The second crewmember sounds worse off than the first..." If she knows anything about the baby... she's not showing any signs of it.

Jack says, "Yeah.. Well, they should be meeting up with you somewhere else. We monitored them getting pretty close to the gate and we decoyed their pursuit, so... Anyway, we need to meet."

"It sounds like it. I've a safe place on one of the planets, or I can come aboard your ship, or vice versa if you'd like..." The woman sounds more than a little troubled. Especially given the news of 'them' being after her ship. "Was the Earth Military out in the Badlands as well? Nevermind. We need to meet. Where?"

"Planetside sounds good. We've got a second ship in tow, and we need to get it fixed up. We'll land shortly." Jack sits back, sighing and rubbing his temples.

"So they are still going to play stupid with us," mutters Emily. "If they don't start giving something information wise, we're going to have to look into matters on our own, I guess."

The planet Cathay is a beautiful planet. Its atmosphere colors the sky a swirl of colors that paint the caps of mountains and skyscrapers alike. The woman's ship has put down in one of the main cities, though it's at an otherwise empty spaceport. She'll hail the ship, letting them know it is indeed safe to land, "At least for now. We'll have to move the ships later on, but for now, this hangar is our private meeting room..."

After landing, Jack hauls the box, and the comatose Mindsman, out on a cargo pallet. The other ship remains in orbit, with a tight-beam relay to the _Fast Buck_ in case of trouble.

Emily will aid Jack (as little as possible!) while still seeming to be kinda helpful. She can't be a total slacker, after all.

There's a brief push at Jack and Emily's mind as the woman reaches out to them. (( Will the two of you accept telepathic communication from myself? ))

(( I'll have him brought to medical immediately, )) is the first thing she communicates, before asking that he be escorted quickly to a hospital. (( Now then... what's this box? This is the cargo that was to be rescued, I take it? ))

Jack sighs, and cracks open the box again, letting his contact take a gander at what's waiting inside.

"You mean you had us rescue cargo and didn't even know what it was?" asks Emily. Man, the world is full of careless people, and she has but one life to cheat them all.

(( A baby? )) She is quite perplexed. (( I was told it was to be... )) And then her thoughts flee quickly, preventing her from wandering down those particular parts of memory lane now. (( Well it is a very interesting development. ))

Jack curls up a fist. (( Told it was to be what? )) he demands, non-verbally.

(( That a box fitting that one's description was to be shipped to our navigation facilities in Keterra, the neighboring system... I was under the impression the cargo was some kind of Jump Gate control system... not a child. ))

Emily just sighs softly and knuckles her back. "I'm willing to not care about your secrets. In fact, I really don't, as long as they satisfy a few requirements. Like not causing me any problems. And provided this whole mess was well worth the risk."

Jack hmmms. (( You assume that a child can't also be a control system, )) he observes. (( The man who you took away brought this on board my ship at the last moment. )) Aloud, he continues. "Then let's get to the neighboring system. Also, we ran into a lot of trouble out there. A little extra compensation may be in order.."

The woman regards Jack curiously (( You know, you have a point... that may well be the case. In any event, perhaps when your comrade wakes up we'll learn more about this child. )) Aloud she continues "Certainly. We should get out of here as swiftly as we can. And I have been authorized to pay you twice the agreed upon price... we should head for Keterra."

Grinning, Jack shakes his head. "No, no, money's not what I want. My pilot, however, has a matter needs seen to, and I want the help of the organization. But we can talk about it on the way.."
