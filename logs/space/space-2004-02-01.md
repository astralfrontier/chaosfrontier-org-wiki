# Space 2004-02-01

"So what kind of help is it you want," asks the telepath, as the _Fast Buck_ touches down on a relatively safe planet. "And what is this... baby?" She has that disbelieving tone in her voice, as though she's trying to accept what's been shown to her, but not quite succeeding.

"We were kinda hoping you'd tell us," mutters Emily, more or less to herself. She doesn't really expect to get many answers, after all. "I just hope the kid is worth something to someone, so they'll come and pick it up."

"Well, basically....." Jack begins by outlining the difficulties Em's been having with her 'friend' Dalion, allowing his pilot to interject where necessary.

Emily's interjections are generally unhelpful, but at least she doesn't swear like a sailor for a change.

"I don't know what anyone intends to do with this kid... but, I'll see who I can contact." The woman turns to speak to Emily, "So, what exactly do you want us to do, madam? Since I am guessing blasting him out of the sky isn't on the list... you want us to aid this... Dalion?"

"Blasting him out of the sky would be just fine with me, actually," says Emily, being quite honest. "He ripped me off and stole every last credit I had. Because of him I wound up running for my life. I wouldn't weep if his neck were broken."

"Well then you should have him arrested and brought to trial, with evidence and witnesses brought to bear against him in galactic court. Murder and Assassination aren't in the area of Mindsmen operation, as I'm sure Jack can tell you. Is there something else we might do?"

"Trial?" Emily tries not to giggle at that, but fails. She nearly tears up over it, even. "I dunno, maybe Jack has some inventive way around this, since he already stopped me from trying to blow that rat up before. Suffice it to say that justice in the corners of the world I frequent is a word defined by the wealthy and powerful."

Jack hmms. "Well, what we could use is evidence of the dirty dealings," he says at last. "We could get that very conveniently from Dalion's mind, and proceed with ironclad proof in a court of law."

"You really think the courts care at all about someone like me?" asks Emily. Jeez, these people are pretty optimistic. "At best they'll take from Dalion and put it in their own pockets, which doesn't do me much good."

"I think they care about the law," retorts Jack, sounding angry. "Now I've just busted my ass and risked my life and come back, to ask the people who sent me on that mission for some compensation, all for you. Now are you gonna at least try to take it or not?"

Emily raises her eyebrows, "Ooookay. Sure. Whatever you suggest, Jack." She guesses she's touched a chord. Oh well, not like it matters much, odds are fate will just bear her out.

"Well, we would be glad to help you in gathering evidence. Certainly. I shall contact some of our probers if you'd like, have them Jump out here as fast as they can."

"That would be much appreciated," growls Jack. "Now, as far as that baby goes, I have no idea. I suggest we proceed as we're expected to. Whatever's in the box doesn't matter. We're not Gate engineers, so let's just not worry about it. If they're surprised to get a cryogenically suspended kid, then they can be surprised. Our job is delivery."

Emily just sighs and goes back to piloting. She'll leave the rest to Jack. It'll be interesting, at least, to see how Jimmy dodges this. And to her, it's just a matter of how, never if.

"Alright. Give me a few minutes to contact the local Mindsmen hq... I'm Sara, by the way." She gives a brief nod, and heads inside of her ship to send the aforementioned Mindsmen, leaving Emily and Jack to plot and scheme for a bit, if they so desire.

Emily isn't going to scheme much, she's too busy ignoring the world. About the only worry she has is that this attempt to gather evidence will get her killed.

It's no trouble getting to the dusky brown world of Nall. The military ships, for all their supposed omnipresence have yet to stumble into this back-water planet in this god-forsaken corner of the universe. Moving the ship through the rocky debris field that orbits the planet is an effortless task for Emily. The surface of the planet is hot, and mostly barren. Dunes of sand rise up in either direction, framing the meeting spot. Two mindsmen ships are there, and two mindsmen await. "So... you have the box?" Asks one, identified as Smith by the tag on his jumpsuit. "Were you followed?"

Jack shrugs. "Not as far as we could tell," he says.

"Alright. I've the payment then, non-traceable credit vouchers." Smith holds three vouchers out, "They're yours. I trust you'll help me load the cargo aboard my ship?"

Jack shrugs. "Sure, why not? I've already busted my hump for you guys, a few more minutes of lugging won't kill me..."

Emily lets Jack do the talking. She doesn't like it, but she won't have to get growled at, and there's really no money in speaking up anyway. As long as she isn't lugging around their ice cube kid she's fine with it.

Smith doesn't even open the box. He checks to see that it's locked, but that's the extent of his survey. Once the cargo is aboard his ship, he'll hand the vouchers over, leaving Jack with the payment. "It's a pleasure doing business with you, Mr. Southport. I owe you one." With that he turns to enter his ship.

"For the trouble I went through you owe me three and a half!" calls Jack. Grumbling, he turns, moving back toward his own ship rather rapidly.

Emily just follows along, though she doesn't really seem to be in too great a hurry. "Glad that's over," is all she'll say about it. Even popsi-kids annoy her.

The mindsmen ships set their course and head away at full speed. The _Fast Buck_ will similarly have no trouble in getting out of the planet's atmosphere. There are two faint sensor contacts in the distance, but they are headed from Gate to Gate in this system, if the trajectory is plotted correctly.

Emily has a way of picking a path that most matches her. Lazy and effective. You know she's doing well because she looks like she's about to fall asleep. In this case, she's out-doing herself, running the ship with her feet for the most part. Fortunately Jack isn't paying too much attention, or he'd probably bug her.

There are maybe three other ships docked at Ten-Forty, a seedy, shady, out of the way salvage yard tucked away in an asteroid in a belt in a nearby system. There's a sparse population here, mostly junk merchants and shadier types, looking for a fast buck, or a few hard to come by parts.

The _Fast Buck_ arrives unceremoniously, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The local newsnet is piped through to Jack's computer, and aside from an increase in military activity in systems that they've recently left, there is little in the way of news that is of interest. The _Fast Buck_ will have it's own hangar, and Jack and Emily are free to sleep there, according to the welcome message.

Emily likes a good game, and likes an easy mark. Two of Jimmy's rats, it seems. And one a cheater. And not a good one. At least not as good as she is. She'll try to approach from behind, though she isn't really much of a sneak. Can't help it, it's just not her way.

As Emily wanders towards the table, and one of Jimmy's lying cheating partners, she'll feel a hand on her shoulder. A greasy, oil-stained hand. "Hello there Miss Emily. Long time no see." It's one of Jimmy's slimy mechanics. "Now I have t'wonder what brings you all the way out here... you're not waiting for Jimmy t'show back up too, are ya?"

Emily smirks, doing two things. First, she's going to kick her foot back at the shin of the mechanic, and at the same time she draws her blaster, aiming at the cheater. "Look up his sleeve, boys, and you'll find an ace. Probably a spade, if there's any justice at all. Oh, and one move, you little bastard, and you'll lose more than this pot."

As soon as Emily's gun is drawn, several others are as well. The ace-up-the-sleeve guy is among the number of weapons drawing people. A few of his cronies will draw their guns, but to Emily's delight, most of the people at the table with the cheater have their guns trained on him. The ubiquitous bouncers begin calling for everyone to "Put your guns away NOW!" Of course, no one ever listens.

"Alright Tom. The lady here says you're cheatin'. Let's see what's up your sleeves eh? If you're not cheatin' then you've got nothing to hide... right? So you won't mind if we roll up your sleeves and take a peek now will you." It's not a question. Or a request.

Emily spares a little glance at the mechanic, who is whining and clutching his leg. "Ever touch me again, grease ape, and I'll turn you into a little boy," she says flatly. She turns her attention back to the cheater, her gun not aimed really at his head, but a bit lower. She has a reputation for aiming dirty, after all.

Of course Tom won't admit that he's cheating. That's why the table's kicked over, and he takes cover behind it just as a burst of light singes the air above him. It's probably also the reason a chair is picked up and cracked over the back of his head. There's nothing quite like a good old fashioned bar brawl.

Emily growls and covers the distance to Jimmy's cheater. There's no hesitation, either. Her leg moves like lightning, her kick brutally aimed. With a most satisfactory **THUMP** her foot makes an impact that may prevent the cheater from having kids without some form of therapy.

The _Fast Buck_ is ringed with waldoes, struts and modular robot tools. Jack himself is watching it out of the corner of his eye, digitally signing the contract that'll make him almost a quarter of a million richer. From somewhere distant his ears pick up the sound of a voice screaming into the high soprano. "Excuse me," he says, curtly. "I think I hear my partner." And with that, he dashes off, leaving the signed contract behind.

As Jack rushes towards the bar, the sounds of a barroom brawl will fill the corridor. Emily is probably at the center of it all. As the bar doors open, a chair goes flying over Jack's head, which is followed shortly thereafter by the body of one rather greasy looking fellow who slumps against one of the walls. Inside is sheer and utter chaos, although the bouncers are getting aruond to doing their jobs. That is to say they're drawing rather big guns and pointing them at the more rowdy people, to help 'convince' them to stop fighting.

Emily is the middle of the brawl, as are the other gamblers. And yet they are the only ones not actively beating the crap out of anyone. Emily crosses her arms and flicks a finger into the cheater's head and he crumples backward. Falling like a ragdoll, his arms follow, and then, riding on the air is the ace, and it settles on the gang member's forehead. "Yep, ace of spades," says Emily, quite satisfied. Fortunately she's just bent down to examine the card, which allows a thrown bottle to go flying across the room, right through the space formerly occupied by her skull.

Jack just watches, aghast.

One of the bouncers will catch the thrown bottle in a desperate attempt to regain control of the room. It will take some effort, but they'll manage to get most of the fighting to stop. "Alright miss," says one, "We'll be taking that fellow. We got rules about what to do with cheaters. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to throw you in the holdin' tank for a while, to cool off. I hope you're gonna help me make your stay as pleasant as can be, by just cooperating..."

Emily tilts her head. "So you slackers sit around while I expose a cheater and defend myself against some groping pervert and you expect me to just go wherever you want? What are you paid for, anyway, standing up at the end and taking all the credit?" She smirks, "Ahhh, wait, I get it. Figures! Big man, you figure you can disarm me, tie me up, and have your way? Why wait, huh? If you want it, try it now!"
