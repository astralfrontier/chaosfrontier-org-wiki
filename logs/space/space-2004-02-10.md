Somewhere, in a middle-of-nowhere, off the gate region of space lies the Ten-Forty. In it's cantina, there is a burly looking man who serves as one of the bouncers for the dank, seedy establishment. This burly looking gentleman-to use the term loosely-has currently locked eyes with Emily for the time being, waves the barrel of his weapon for emphasis as he makes his statement. "I'll ask ya one more time. Will you please go down to the coolin' off tank for the night? Or do I have t'get a little less... polite?"

Emily looks to Jack and sighs. (( You might want to do something, cause I'm so close to shooting both these guys! )) And judging from previous experiences, such a move is hardly beyond her capabilities. "If you put me in that cooling tank, I'm talking to your boss and I'll make sure you both get fired," she says coolly. Or she could just blow off his kneecaps later.. she likes that idea even more than getting him fired.

Jack frowns and sighs, approaching with caution. "What's the trouble here?" he calls, as he moves.

The bouncer addresses Jack without turning his head. "Well, seems like a fight broke out. This lady here caught that piece of sleaze cheating," he indicates the member of Dallion's gang being dragged off, "Which is nice, but she pulled a weapon. Which is forbidden, 'less of course yer an employee. So I was asking if she'd sit a spell in the brig."

"Hang on a minute, then," says Jack, conversationally. "Let me talk to your boss, before you take her out of here."

Emily just frowns and glowers at the bouncers. (( Incompetent idiots. )) She can't help but want a fight with them, now. Useless jerks.

"What is it with you people and wantin' to talk to my boss..." The bouncer sighs. "Fine. I'll get 'im. Just do me a favor and get her to calm down and not draw on anyone else..." With that he reaches for a comm device. "Hey, Mister Zinaida, there's a couple o' people who want to talk to you, if you can come down."

Adelai Zinaida, a withered looking man, late in years but impeccably dressed ambles down. He doesn't seem particularly concerned about the mess, or anything else in particular. There are three bodyguard types walking with him, though he pays them no more attention than anyone else might pay their shadow. "Ahhh, I am here. What is trouble? Who wants to talk with me?"

Emily will let Jack do the talking for now. So far all she sees is that there are even more guards to deal with than she had at the start of this mess. Buncha lazy slackers.

Jack steps forward and smiles, drawing the boss away somewhat from the crowd. "You hired this woman yesterday," he explains conversationally. "She's good at finding cheaters - that is, those who need to be found out. She's quick on the draw and she does good work. At least for a few days - what do you say?"

"Of course. Of course I hire her yesterday." Zinaida smiles at Jack, a rather unnerving sight at that. He continues, his speech thickly accented, "Is good for business, less trouble. Forgive these bouncers, they like their job yes, a little too much sometimes. I am happy to have employed her for last two days." A brief pause precedes an almost used-car-salesman glint in the older man's eyes. "And you friend, who save me so much trouble, what is it I have hired you for hmmm?"

"I made a profit from my transactions in the shipyard, and they're still looking at a million and a half in profits from the sale of goods I provided," smiles Jack. "I'm afraid I'm spoken for. However, should you have need of a merchant or mechanic on a contract basis, I'm your man."

"Ah, so you are one responsible for nice tidy profit. You come with me, you and your friend. We have drinks, we toast, we celebrate. Is good business. You are good businessman. Perhaps I need you when you're not so spoken for." Zinaida waves a hand, as he shouts at the bouncer, "Is okay. She work for me. Go clean up mess, pick up glass, tell bartender to mix three drinks, what you have, Mr..." the old man pauses a moment, looking at Jack, "What is name?"

"Southport, Jack Southport." That worthy introduces himself with a smile. "I'd be honored to accept your hospitality."

Emily just hangs around, waiting to see what Jack is accomplishing over there. Hmm.. well, at worst there are less than 10 guards, so she's been in tighter spots. When the call for her release comes she lets out a sigh. With a too-sweet smile she says to a guard, "No hard feelings." She heads over to Jack and stops behind him.

One of the tables is set right, and chairs are brought to it. The chaos of the brawl is clearing up by this point, though the bouncer that was told to let go of Emily is complaining. Zinaida sits, waits for the others to join him. "So what shall we toast, Mister Southport?" To Emily, "Miss..." he pauses, "Or is it missus?"

"Miss," she says smoothly. "And you can just call me Emily, sir." In a moment, Emily turns the charm back on and offers her hand. He owns the place, maybe he has money! Maybe the cosmos is finally going to stop ripping her off.

"To a few days of peace and prosperity," suggests Jack, smiling.

Three glasses are brought and set in front of Jack, Emily, and Zinaida. "Yes, is good toast. To peace and prosperity." He raises his glass, waits for Jack and Emily and then drinks. "So I am owing you as well, Miss Emily," says Zinaida, "for finding cheater and saving money. And for pretty face."

Emily this man more every moment. "It was a pleasure to help you, sir," answers Emily. She can be so well-behaved when men are flattering her skills and beauty. She even fakes a blush at the compliment of her face.

"Am glad you are pleased to help me." Zinaida smiles. It's still somewhat unnerving, but he's jovial nonetheless. "So how long are you two staying, yes? Is for next few days, or for longer? What brings you to my corner of space... hmmm?"

"Ship repairs and refitting," replies Jack. "We have an appointment, then another five days of work, according to the technicians. After that, who knows? We go where the money is."

"Five days? Hmm. Five days good... Thanks to you, Mister Southport, money is here. Perhaps when business is done, you come here, find more money, do more good things yes?" Zinaida folds his hands together, regarding Jack and then Emily as though sizing them up. He nods to himself.

Jack nods slowly. "I'll do that."

Emily will just look pretty and drink. She wants to appear innocent and submissive for now. She's partially doing it just to make Jack suspicious.

"Good. I think I can find work for you here, if you do. Yes. Is way of helping me again. I like you two, Mister Southport, Miss Emily. I hope you catch more cheaters Miss Emily, but for now, I have business. Is shame, but is life. Business is life. Thank you for drink. Please, keep in contact. Ask around if need reach me." Zinaida then stands, and turns to go.

Jack raises his glass, then turns to Emily with a smile. "So, that went well."

"I suppose this means I can't gamble," laments Emily. "But at least the owner has good taste." He did say she was pretty, after all. "Anyway, what are you going to do while I do my new day job?"

Jack shrugs. "I told Dalion we'd be out there. I hope you're going to come with me. We're under no obligation to actually do anything, just appear."

"Oh yeah, that'll be a hoot," says Emily, looking rather unamused. "I hope those friends of yours show up and do something. I rather doubt I'll get any of my money back, though. Dalion isn't a gang leader because he's easy to catch in the act."

Jack chuckles softly. "We'll do the best we can, okay? Now come on."

Emily snorts and gets up, "Don't forget that I've got a job here." She has to hang around at least a little. She wouldn't want to miss a compliment. And a chance to rub that guard's nose in it.

"So ask for a vacation!" calls Jack at her departing back.

---

"This is probably a set-up," says Emily. She adds, "If he's late, it's for a reason. I hope you are ready for it." She hopes this ship can actually put up a fight when (not if) Jimmy backstabs them.

About an hour after the ship shows up, they'll detect another ship coming into range, moving at a rather fast speed. It takes another two minutes or so, and the _Sleeveless Ace_, Jimmy's ship, comes into view. It opens a hail, "Well now, I didn't think you'd actually show up. Hello."

"Anyone who knows me knows I keep my word," responds Jack. "So yeah, I bluffed you earlier. But here I am now. People know I'm here, and why, so let's all be friends for now. What do you need?"

"I was hoping we wouldn't," says Emily. "Last time I dealt with you, Jimmy, you ripped me off. Even when you cheat, though, you barely win. And now it looks like you can't even keep your little band of brats together."

"Well, that's where you come in handy Em. Like I've said, you owe me. If you hdan't cheated we wouldn't be in this mess now." Jimmy grins, smugly, "But if you want to start working it off, you'll help me collect my 'little band of brats'. Won't you?"

Emily laughs a little, "You really want me to pay you back, Jimmy? I'll do it, here and now, and your brats can just wonder where I hid your body."

"Is that so? You wanna have a little showdown, here and now? Go ahead. Fire. I dare ya. I double dog dare ya." Jimmy leans back in his chair, the sound carrying over on the broadcast. "You won't. You're too yellow." He doesn't make mention of the fact that the mindsmen ship is now heading their way, moving into sensor range just now.

"Guys?" Jack's voice is a sigh. "Jimmy, come aboard. You act macho. Time to walk the walk. We'll discuss this in person. No weapons."

"Hmph, Jimmy's a coward, he's only here to see if he can rip me off again," says Emily. About time the mindsmen show up. Hell must've frozen over if Emily turns out to be the only one to arrive on-time. "Unless I get every last credit back that he took, plus interest, I won't help him."

"Alright then." Jimmy sounds a little surprised. "I'll head over. Lemme just get my shuttle up and running." It'll take about 5 minutes or so before he's ready, but a shuttle will launch, and request permission to dock with the _Fast Buck_. Jimmy's presumably.

Jack meets the shuttle at the airlock. He's unarmed and unarmored. "Alright, come in. Now, explain the problem."

"Like I said. Some of my boys have been scattered, rounded up, and so on. I need someone with Em's particular... lyin' cheatin' no good double crossin' skills to help me round them up for myself..." explains Jimmy.

Emily is there, not happy about it. She listens to Jimmy and answers right away, "Pass. You are a useless ass, Jimmy, and there's no way I'm helping you."
