The world of Nenmar is a busy one. It is one of the few supposed bastions of civilization out near the backwater parts of space that Jack and Em have been fooling around in. Its reputation for medical care is well-known through the human territories, and so it is there that the injured telepath is brought. He has been taken in for some emergency care, while Jack and Emily await the news back aboard the _Fast Buck_. Meanwhile messages from the Mindsmen HQ come in, requesting more information from Jack. Seems he's hearing more and more from them these days.

Jack files reports and more reports, summarizing the facts and situation as he understands them. Where difficult truths arise, he states them baldly; where fact gives way to summation and opinion, he makes the distinction clear.

"We're getting paid for this, right?" murmurs Emily softly, though she's not really asking anyone but herself. Funny, she used to not care about what happened to people as long as she wound up on top. Things are getting so complicated now. She sits more or less idle, winding a long lock of hair around a finger, and then unwinding it, then winding it again.

Jack shrugs and grunts. "Sure sure," he replies gruffly. "The Mindsmen take care of their own. They aren't the richest, but we've done alright for ourselves so far, hmm?"

"Hmmm?" Emily raises her eyes to look at Jack. "Did you say something?" she asks, her voice sounding unusually soft. "Everything is weird. I don't like it. Something really bad is happening, and it's happening around us." Not that she's scared..

Jack laughs a bit, and sits back, staring at his pilot. "Are you serious? Yes, some bad things are happening. But we're in a modern space-faring society. Weird things are _de rigeur_. Bad things are just a consequence of that."

"Luck runs in streaks, and bad things tend to cluster," murmurs Emily. "Or so the gypsy heart of me seems to think. We're in over our heads, Jack. There are times when you have to throw down the best hand and get away from the table for a while."

Another of the consequences of a modern-space faring society is the omnipresent newsnet, bringing information of both useful and inane happenings in the Universe to the inhabitants thereof. Today's bulletins are more of the latter type, although there is one thing of interest... a news story detailing another ship, hit in a similar manner to the mindsmen's ship, was turned up floating at the edge of a military base's sensor perimeter. Although it is reputed that there were no bodies discovered aboard the ship when boarded by military investigators.

The salvaged ship is reputed to have belonged to one BErtram Hainzel, who has been missing for the past three days.

Jack's first act is to send a rather urgent email to Eisen Mining Company, along with details of his location - he'd already informed them of his roll in Mr. Hainzel's escape, and if this is something of theirs, he'd rather do business than find himself testing the validity of the afterlife.

The spacer's next order of business is a transmission of this news item, along with his ship's abstracts and records on his involvement, to the Mindsmen. If he must be avenged, he sees no reason not to get a head start on the process.

Emily frowns and hmms. "Remind me to buy some kinda good luck charm," she murmurs. "I think we've got a black cloud chasing us around.. and it's nothing Jimmy would do. He's not got the sand for this nasty stuff."

Both messages are received in due course. The Mindsmen hold onto the records Jack has sent them and return a copy of their own notes taken on the EMC's activities. The Eisen Mining Company report that, "Currently we are investigating the manner. If you care to assist us in this, we would be glad to compensate you for information acquired on our behalf..."

The military cruiser _Mercy's Edge_ is an imposing vessel. It is large enough to easily accomodate the _Fast Buck_ as well as many other ships all at once. Trade occurs regularly here, and they are more than welcoming to the traders. Once informed of the pair's desires, one Colonel McLeod agrees to meet with Jack and Emily. And so the three meet up aboard the one of the cruiser's many observation lounges. "Well then... what exactly is it you want to talk with me about," asks the good Colonel.

Jack taps out a few directives; his computer offers the Colonel's a precis of the crew's recent events. "To sum up," he opens, "we're connected with at least two known victims of this phenomenon."

Emily will show up in her best, of course. If nothing, she has an incredible selection of clothes and it is growing at a geometric pace, seemingly. She follows a golden rule, though. Let Jack do the talking. Once the business is done, than she'll say something.

"I see. And what exactly are you needing from me? Forgive me for being blunt, but this thing has all the higher-ups scared. I'm not sure what you're cleared to handle, but I am sure I can dig up something on this... phenomena for you, if that's what you're after?" Colonel McLeod does a good job of hiding his concern for the matter behind a general military bearing.

"Basically," says Jack, trying to sum up, "whatever information you can release would be nice. We're not detectives or combatants, we're businesspeople. If there's some evidence either way that this may be something we have to be wary of personally, we'd sure like to know about it."

"Alright. I'm always happy to help a civillian out. Wait aboard the ship for a day or so while I check with security, then you'll get your information. Such as it may be." With that the Colonel turns to leave. "I'll be in contact with you."

Jack smiles and offers his hand. "Thanks a lot. We appreciate it," he says, sincerely.

Emily offers a polite nod and a slight bow (the better to see, my dear) to the colonel as he turns to leave. She isn't sure what will come of this, of course, but doesn't want to get rusty.

According to the military's information, at least that which has been deemed safe for Jack's eyes, there have been reports of three ships totalt hat have been hit in the same fashion within the last week. At the time, sensors have always been heavily disrupted, though apparently there is at least one eyewitness who claims to know what has happened. He reported a shuttle, modified for long-range travel docking with another ship, and then shortly thereafter, the ship went dead. There are two descrambled satellite images that back up this particular recounting recording. There has also been an increase of Military deployment out to the Gaian borders, though there is no mention of why. At least not for Jack's eyes.

Jack reviews, digests, and shares this with Emily (and the Mindsmen, via transmission). Thereafter his computer is set to automatically warn, in the highest possible levels of priority alert, of any attempt to dock. "Alright," he says then, addressing his pilot. "Got any ideas?"

There is one last file. An audio recording of an intercepted tight-beam transmission. Given that it has 'Top-Secret' and 'Eyes Only' stamped across it. This probably isn't supposed to be in anyone's possession.

Emily is, at the moment, considering a pair of crystalline earrings. "Hmm, I figure they'll go great with my white, strapless gown. Probably with high heels..." She grins, "Anyway, I figure.. what the hell is that?" She peers at the 'top secret' label.

There are three different voices recorded in this transmission. Two of them are devoid of inflection and emotion. The other is clearly the twitchy, panicky voice of Bertram Hainzel. "We know all about your involvement in this affair, Mister Hainzel. You will surrender and prepare to be boarded, then you will tell us about Gretel." Hainzel's voice squeaks in, "Nein! I know my rights! You can't board my ship without the proper-" The other monotone cuts in, "We have our own authority. You were given the chance to do this peacefully." Hainzel starts screaming something about The Red Moons, then the transmission is cut off.

"That is just not cool," murmurs Emily. "The Red Moons... I wonder what the heck that means?" She frowns thoughtfully, trying to think about anything she knows by that name.

Emily is more than just eager to get off the ship. She wears a surprisingly mundane outfit. After all, there's no point in dressing well on your way to a fine store. It's their job to turn her into a goddess, and she doesn't want to taint the mind of artists with her own impressions. She's eager for them to show off her divine beauty. If Jack asks, she'll even say this to him. And with a straight face. Not that she's vain.

And Emily finds a veritable paradise. She stops at the finest shop she can find and slips inside. She makes a point to do nothing flirtatious. Here such a thing would be heresy! Instead she shows off her money and spares no expense. She doesn't need a lot today, she wants just one 'perfect' outfit for herself. And her hair needs work, and her nails are a disaster! She has a desperate need of pampering, it seems. By about midday, she's massaged, painted by the best make-up artists, and clothed like a movie star. Her nails are sculpted, her skin carefully softened, and her hair like silk.

After she's completely ready, Emily makes her way to the shrine. A casino of good taste, with handsome men and beautiful women. Emily shines, of course. Here she flirts with casual ease. This is both her religion and her play, after all. Dice, cards, steel balls in wheels. The world feels like it's going to be her's, tonight. It's time for some very good luck.

When Emily struts back into the ship (and strut is the right word!) she's got a whole lot more credits than she started with. She smiles impishly at Jack. "I got you a luck charm," she tells him. And she plops down 110,000 credits. "That is for the loan. I hope 10 percent is okay?" She can't help but giggle with glee.

Jack hums. "Say," he offers, smiling. "How'd you like to contribute to my 'save-the-ship' fund? We need a bigger power plant for our thrusters, and you've complained in the past that we're under-armed."

Emily arches an eyebrow and hmms. "Well.. yeah, this thing could use some improvements. Like a hot tub, for one." She grins, "I'll help you, Jack. What kinda girl do you think I am, anyway? You bailed me out and haven't done anything to cheat me. Just tell me what you need and I'll go gamble my way towards it. You find us any normal work? Or any answers?"

Jack shakes his head. "No normal work yet, I haven't had time. But take a look at this...."

Meanwhile, the datanet will return several references to Red Moons and Gretel. Although there are plenty that likely have nothing to do whatsoever with what they're involved in. There are a few planets known for their red moons, three of them near the system where they first met Hainzel. There's also the rumor of an eco-terror group called 'The Red Moons' that operates out of the New London system. Coincidentally, the planet New London is known for it's highly-mined and polluted twin red moons. As far as finding any solid lead on whatever Gretel may be, that has yet to turn up any solid results.

From that, Jack begins reviewing options for further improvement to the ship. He shows Emily a few cost figures, then begins thinking. "We could score a few more lasers," he concludes. "We just need to drive them."

"Well, let's get a good base, first, so we don't limit ourselves," says Emily. "If we can get a good deal and get some real power, we should do that and be patient, if the weapons need to be delayed, we'll delay. Besides, I need to hold onto a bit so I can build more for us, too." She can be oddly prudent when pleasure, gambling, and clothes aren't involved.

"Alright then." Briefly, Jack begins to sketch out his plan. Emily can carouse as she wishes; Jack will even lend out $300,000 of his own, on condition that it be repaid. His terms are 'half of the net profit', which he considers quite generous. "Aside from that, I think I am outmatched here," he confesses at last. "Whatever force this is may not be immune to telepathy, so.. I want to go in for some additional training. If this thing comes for us, I want to be prepared."

"Well, the best I can do is make us as much money as possible," says Emily. She actually seems a little nervous about taking Jack's money. It feels like a burden, somehow. "And don't worry, I'll win us a mountain of cash. Well, provided I don't get banned in all the casinos, anyway." She grins sheepishly, "They don't like big winners. If I start as a big spender, though, they'll forgive my skill for a longer time." She doesn't mention how flashing cleavage is a big help in this.

Jack nods slowly. "I'll be relying on you, Emily," he says firmly. "So, let's get to work. And keep in touch!"

For the next three weeks, with the assent and understanding of his colleages in the psychic guild, Jack engages in comprehensive instruction. Telepathy-transferred memories are interspersed with psychic bouts, in which his ability to mesh his mind with that of another is enhanced, sharpened, and put to more productive uses. He learns some of the disciplines of the elder Mindsmen, gaining an understanding of how to apply his abilities offensively or coercively. And by the same token, his resolve to use his abilities is strengthened and tested, time and again, by a gruelling examination in which the elders assault him, and monitor his thoughts for signs of aggression or intemperate use of his power.

Emily's time is all play. Or so it would seem. She's actually less like a happy little kitten and a lot more like a sleek leopard, stalking. She follows the rules well. Don't win too many large pots, never clean anyone out, be generous (which is to say smile when pinched), and never play stupid. She spends nights in expensive hotel suites. It makes the suits more kind. And she shares dinner with a different person each night. She keeps herself very relaxed as the money just keeps rolling-in.

As the pair of spacers are reunited, Jack returning from his gruelling mental workout, and Emily from her gruelling... well it's not that it has really been gruelling for her when it coems down to it. As the two meet with one another, there is a message waiting in the _Fast Buck's_ computer. Three of them actually, two looking for a pilot for hire, the third from the Eisen Mining Company, wondering if Jack has found out anything further in the matter at hand.

Jack addresses the third first, suggesting that the company consult with the military for further details. The remaining messages then occupy his attention.

Emily is too busy feeling good. She's in a new outfit, of course. Her skin is more tan, and practically glowing. She's pampered herself every single day, obviously, and has no regrets. Well, except that it had to end. Still, she's happy to be back on the ship. All that relaxing and play at once was starting to dim her enjoyment!

One of the messages is from Mr. Zinaida. It requests the presence of his favorite businessman to help him take care of a few things that need taking care of on a backwater moon... the other is from someone by the name of Raymond Garaeg, wanting a lift out of the New London system. He even manages to mention Jack by name, as well as certain incidents in the badlands. "I can pay... but you're the only one I can think of that I trust."

After a consultation with Emily, Jack composes a carefully neutral reply. Along the way he sends a note to Eisen - "we're investigating a possible lead. I expect payment in full if it yields results." And with messages handled, he leans back in his chair, humming thoughtfully. "At least you had fun for awhile," he remarks to his well-primped pilot.
