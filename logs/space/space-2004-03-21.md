# Space 2004-03-21

It's been a few days since Jack and Emily set out for the New London system. Nothing untoward has happened, nothing yet. They have arrived safely. Raymond Garaeg, their contact is awaiting them on the planet Avalon. So named for it's lush forests and fairy-tale like landscape. Terraforming and Eugenics have bred all manner of strange beasts. According to his latest communication he's hiding out in a cave beneath the surface of Avalon. "I hope you get this Jack, not sure how much charge is left on my comm-unit. Tell the Queen I hope she's alright."

Raymond climbs aboard the _Fast Buck_ looking quite relieved. He looks familiar. Very familiar. He's one of the survivors from the badlands. Perhaps one of the last three. "Thanks Jack... I don't know who else to turn to or I wouldn't have mentioned anything." He'll nod to Emily, "Your majesty, Queen of the Known Universe." He sighs, "I need help. I need out of this system. I'm sure you've heard of it. Everyone on our ship... dead... just about everyone from the badlands dead..."

Emily hmms thoughtfully. "Your Queen detects that you are rather easy," she says, a small smile coming to her lips. "So when are you going to stop feeding us half the deal? If my ass is on the line for this, I want to know why and what for."

"Alright..." The guy gives a shrug. "Last I heard they had been ambushed. I think I know why. Someone on that ship didn't die. Someone called whatever it was on them. And now they're going after whoever's left..." Raymond shakes his head, "I've gotta get out of system."

Jack nods slowly. "Alright. For us to agree to this," he says, "I need for you to consent to telepathic contact. We need every bit of information we can get."

Emily is going to ask something else, then, but she'll wait for the sure deal. "I have a few serious questions. We're in deep as hell with god knows what, now. What we do know is it can slaughter people without much trouble. Those were all mentalists too, weren't they? Probably pretty powerful, I'm guessing."

Raymond debates this for a while. He sighs, resigning himself to this. "Yeah... alright. Go ahead and check my brains. Just er, don't say nothin' funny." He turns to Emily, "I don't know. I don't want to find out."

Reaching out, the spacer places a hand on his relaxing would-be passenger's shoulder and makes the contact, merging his mind slowly with the other's.

Emily is just waiting to see results of this, herself, but she can't help but ask. "What's the deal with that thing we found in suspension? I'm guessing it's of some importance in this mess. You don't get hunted and slaughtered for something cheap. That job was done as a message or," and here she frowns, repulsed "for fun."

As soon as the escaping vessel broke free of the badlands, Raymond sent a message to his companions in arms. Pirates. He left the ship and disappeared into the New London system. He's been hiding out ever since... at least until word of the deaths of his temporary shipmates came through the datanet. He accesses highly illegal equipment to tap into their sensor logs and recorded someone sending a transmission. He was unable to decode anything but the time signature... a day or so before the ship was attacked and destroyed. Now he's convinced that whatever it was that eliminated the crew, is coming after him and anyone else associated with that ship.

Jack hums slowly from within his telepathic trance. "This transmission you intercepted," he says. "You have a record of it, still?"

Raymond nods, "Yeah... I still have a copy of it. It's been sent to a friend, to be released upon my demise. Although we could get a copy of it from him, I'm sure."

Jack nods. "That would be useful."

Emily will just wait to hear the more pertinent details of this little exploration. She's beginning to wonder just what the hell kinda mess she's going to get landed-in here.

"Alright... then we'll need to get out of New London and make a stop back in the Eisen systems." Raymond gives a shrug, "We'll have to make it fast though."

Jack nods, and breaks the connection. "Emily, if you would?" he says, gesturing toward the cabin. "You sit with my copilot," he directs to Raymond. "I'll be checking the ship, methodically. Let's get to it."

Emily nods to Jack and heads towards the cabin. "Time for the Queen to hold court, it seems." She smirks and murmurs to herself, "At least I'll die royal." She asides to the passenger, "So Raymond, you gamble?"

The next ten hours of Jack's time are spent in productive inspection. He examines his vessel stem to stern, stopping just short of disassembling it in his hunt for anything out of the ordinary. More than once his voice can be heard over the internal-announcement system, cursing his dependence on glasses and swearing vociferously at the Mindsmen who laid this bane on him.

It's easy enough to get out of the New London system. The trick is getting from there to the Eisen system. Particularly since the intervening system holds a rather interesting surprise. As soon as they leave the gate, there are three freighters waiting for them. Weapons are armed, though they are attempting to hail the _Fast Buck_

"Attention freighter _Fast Buck_, heave to and prepare to be borded." The ship in lead of the others is hailing. A Captain Junkers is identified in the hail. "We'll be taking whatever cargo you have to offer..."

Jack flips on the stealth suite as he speaks off-line: "Emily, get us back through the gate, pronto!" Switching to the comsuite, he replies. "By what authority do you act?"

"Well seeing as how we're three ships with four heavy lasers each... I think that's enough authority for us..." replies the not so good captain.

Emily snorts at the pirates. The effort is far from her best, perhaps Emily is just testing, or perhaps she's distracted. Still, far from her best is enough to get away from these guys, and like a wisp the Fast Buck vanishes into the gate.

Meanwhile, Jack is at his station, having displaced the ship's only current passenger. He stays busy, running network searches, connecting to system computing resources, to see if this apparent space-jacking right at the border of a gate is connected to the current assignment. Mumbling to himself, he works with a single-minded dedication that reveals his true trust in his pilot, for even with the earlier brush with danger he is confident enough in her abilities not to look up to even see for himself how things stand.

The pirates curse, although there is not much in the way of pursuit. The ship moves too fast and simply disappears from their sensors. So instead they disperse, going their separate ways so as to avoid detection by the local security.

After disappearing from the pirates and sending them on their merry way, reaching Raymond's buddy is a somewhat easier task. They pick up a copy of the transmission. It is heavily encrypted, though the time signature HAS been decoded. Raymond will point out, "We need to be leaving soon... I can pay and everything, but I don't want to stay in one place too long." He pauses, "No offense or anything your majesty I'm just paranoid."

"I'd rather not get killed for someone else's fetish anyway," says Emily. "So how long until we crack this message and have the whole secret, Jack?" she asks. It doesn't occur to her for a second that it could possibly be a challenge for him.

"Good question," muses the spacer. "I don't have any really high-grade decryption software, just the usual stuff I rely on. In the meantime, let's see about making some distance?"

Emily nods to Jack. "Distance it is. Any particular direction? I figure someplace with lots of brass might be good.. but that's a rather predictable path to tread. We could find a hiding place and be forgotten for a while. Your call."

On the way toward the unsavory asteroids Jack remembers earlier, he takes a short break to explain his thinking to his pilot. "We'll lay low for a little while, and I want to see if someone can get me a line on high-grade crypto in case my efforts aren't good enough for this. I don't want ANYONE boarding this ship from here on out, though. Nobody we know. Nobody we don't."

Emily nods to Jack. "For their own safety as much as ours, keep away is a good idea," she says. "Anyway, our passenger isn't going to step off either, I don't think. I want them to forget about him. If we could fake his death it'd be even better, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Besides, if they know that we've met him.. well, I doubt any insurance companies will give us policies."

Zinaida is waiting for them back at the asteroids. "Ahhhh my friends. You come back here. We are honored to have you." Is his message through the comm system, "I prepare a dock for you, you can sit, come in, stay a while, do business... maybe?"

"Business? Maybe. I've got a knot I can't quite untie," replies Jack, while the ship gracefully edges toward safe harborage - or as safe as it gets out here. "I'm looking for someone with software that might help turn some gibberish into something more.. useful."

"Ahhh yes. You want decryption. Yesss. Is costly program, not easy to come by out here, but can be found for you. Is considered done. But I am afraid I should ask you for favor in return," informs the older man, "If you are of mind to do so for me."

"We're rather in the middle of something," demurs Jack. "How long could it wait for?"

"Have to wait a long time if we're dead," murmurs Emily softly, and well away from the communicator. She considers Raymond for a moment and muses, "You guys bugged or something, or just rotten luck?" she asks.

"Well is pressing business. Is not something for waiting too long. I can find something else for trade if you are in business..." Zinaida chuckles, "Is something you need help with, this business?"

Raymond turns to the queen of the known universe, "I've taken... ah painful precautions to make sure I'm not bugged... let's leave it at that shall we?"

Jack hmms. "Yes, more or less," he says carefully. "We're just moving something someplace, so this is frankly just to make ourselves feel better about the delivery."

"Is some way I can help you? I have ships, can take package for you. Are unknown ships if need be. We'll see how long is taking for decryption software for you..." Zinaida will then end the message, and not respond for some time, presumably he's busy.

Emily laughs at Raymond and nods, "I'll just imagine the details when I'm thinking of appropriate punishments for people who break my nails." Seeing the transmission cut-off, she says to Jack, "Well, that was weird as ever.."

Jack chuckles. "Mutual mistrust is no way to run a business," he comments, gesturing to the now-blank screen. "This is why I prefer to deal honestly and openly with people. Still, there are some things you can't really get that way.."

Raymond fidgets nervously. "Who was that guy?" He waits a moment, then asks, "What's going to happen now? Is there something I should be doing?"

"The truth would just put him in danger," says Emily. "Then again, we don't even know the truth, do we? We just know a bunch of jerks are putting us in danger for god knows what. This is probably one of those military things. Military guys are only fun outside their uniforms.."

Jack snickers, then addresses his passenger. "That guy is someone we know from an earlier visit. I don't entirely trust him, but he's played straight so far. I'm looking for a clue to this transmission - if we can break it we might have a better chance of dealing with whateverthisis."

Raymond sighs, "Alright. Well... I'll feel better when we get this whole thing over and done with. You're sure we're safe here right?"

Jack shakes his head. "No, and that is why we're staying on the ship, and nobody is coming on board," he counters. "But we are taking every step that is compatible with safety."

"Of course we aren't sure," says Emily. "You don't even know what's after us." She's not here for baby-sitting or comforting her 'subjects'. "We're a lot safer here than any other place, though. They probably don't expect us to go to the middle of nowhere."

It is some time later when Zinaida hails them again. "Well... have found decryption. How soon you are needing it, yes?" He goes on, "Is something to be had yes, but is difficult to obtain in next few days. Give me a week and I can have it for you."

Jack frowns. "A week is a long time," he says, considering. "Mr. Garaeg, do you have a particular destination in mind? If not, I'd like to see about putting you off somewhere safe, and keeping you informed of our results, should we come up with any."

"Anywhere far far away from New London, or any of these other ships that have been blown up... yeah. No particular destination in mind though. Where do you think you'll stick me, and for how long?" Raymond looks concerned, to say the least.

Jack sits down and begins hunting through astronavigation records. Star charts, system information, and other details flash past, as his automation executes the carefully-crafted query he fed into it. He waits patiently, selecting for further details from time to time, and sliding responses off into a queue for further consideration. At last he sits back to look at his options.

"Any way we can put him somewhere where nobody will have to see his face?" asks Emily. "Seems like there might be some very good money out after you, Raymond. The fewer eyes on you the better. Hopefully we can figure out just why these guys are after you in the mean-time. Even if we wind up blowing them all up beforehand."

Jack transmits a message to Zinaida. "Alright. We'll take delivery of decryption software in a week. We're going to make a delivery, then return to see what business you have for us, if it's still left. You'll understand if I don't give you a time/distance estimate.." He sends that, then turns to regard Raymond. "We're going to set off for this moon," he says, indicating the glowing display. "While we go, I want to do some more telepathic delving.. "

"Alright..." murmurs Raymond, "What else do you need? My mom's maiden name and my date of birth?"

Jack shakes his head. "This is serious business, sir," he retorts.

Raymond nods, "Alright... alright... just try not to do any damage."

Emily just shakes her head and sighs. "I wish there was a way to just gamble my way out of this whole mess.." There will probably be a lot of gambling coming up, though. And if she wins, she might even get to live.

As Jack delves into Raymond's experiences with his pirate friends, he will find nothing that would endanger him that's out of the ordinary as far as pirates go. There's the usual authority threatening him and such, but nothing too terribly unsuaul there. In the badlands he experienced a powerful psychic trauma, kind of like a Scream, but it doesn't seem to have done much, mostly because he's not Psychic. He's suspicious of the Mindsman Telepath that was on the ship with them, especially after he just disappeared from the ship. He's even more suspicious of one of the other crew members-Jaonil Hung. Always acted oddly. Left him feeling uneasy when they were alone. Plus he was the comm-operator of the ship before they had gotten wrecked in the badlands. And then... there's the research.

The research they did while tracking the mindsmen ship through the badlands. The orders that had come down from the high-ups, the people who gave his captain his ship and his 'letter of mark' as it were. They were given piles upon piles of data on this ship and the badlands and told to attack it and capture its cargo. He has no idea why. This bothers him more than anything he's done in the past, which, given his memories, isn't saying much.

As far as the 'scream' goes, to his mind it was as though he was experiencing a headache, though the telltale traces of a powerful anti-psionic attack linger in his mind, even this long after the attack has been made. Also buried somewhere deep within his mind is what remains of an attempt to leave a suggestion buried within him, to turn him to whatever purpose might be needed when given the proper psychic command.

Jaonil Hung... Raymond doesn't know much about him. He knows when he showed up-about two months before the badlands thing, and he knows that he doesn't like the fellow very much. He apparently remembers an attempt to be personable, but that it never seemed to work.

Jack probes further, delving through the layers of the other man's psyche. The synchronization of layers is always difficult, but Jack's recent and frequent connection with Emily seems to have been a source of improvement. He delves with surety of purpose, seeking for those lingering traces of telepathic compulsion that he himself could emplace in a weaker mind.

The layers of the man's psyche are sifted through easily enough and as Jack searches for the lingering traces of compulsion... he'll find them. Weak perhaps, but they are there, and probably enough to affect this poor man's mind.
