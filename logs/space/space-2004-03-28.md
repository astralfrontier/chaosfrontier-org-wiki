# Space 2004-03-28

In the many tiered layers of consciousness that make up the mind, one can hide many things. Jack has learned many of these secrets in one particular mind: that of Raymond Garaeg. One secret in particular is of pressing concern, the insidious seed of a telepathic suggestion. It has been left there, so that when activated by the proper psionic signal, the mind will come under the utter control of the sender of said signal.

The spacer sits back and frowns. "Emily," he calls, "keep on course. Raymond, I'm going to dose you with Morphazine. Somebody's targeted you for telepathic contact; you yourself would be the instrument of our undoing. But I have a plan."

Emily nods to Jack and frowns at the mention of telepathic meddling, though. "Maybe we ought to keep him umm, under control, just in case?" she suggests. "Nothing personal, I just don't want you to kill me, you know?"

Jack chuckles, low and evil. "I think you'll approve of my methods. Nobody will have to die, or even get hurt."

"Heh... uhmmm... well alright. As long as I wake up with my pants on the right way and everything where I left it..." Raymond nods, looking warily at Jack. "I trust you man. That Mindsmen code had better not be a load. Alright. Dope me up."

Under the effects of the Morphazine, Raymond relaxes, tucked away in a nice drug induced sleep while Jack sifts through the memories of the unconscious fellow. At first there is nothing there... but to the trained mind, the subtle signs of altered memories are present. Specifically it looks as though someone has sealed off parts of his memory. Jack breaks through the seal easily enough, and he can now feel Raymond remembering as two men, one in a red suit, and one in a blue suit, approached him. He remembers them dragging him into a vehicle and taking a quick ride through the streets of New London. He also remembers the terrifying sensation of them plowing unsubtly through his mind, as though they were performing delicate surgery with a huge axe.

The memories continue, and Raymond is left on the streets of New London with a strong compulsion in his mind, to travel to the badlands. As Jack continues to sift, he'll become acutely aware of the fact that deep within Raymond's subconscious mind, he knows what they were doing in his brain. He knows what they were looking for, and that they were after him for a reason. What that reason is, he cannot be sure of... but that thought is as clear as day to Raymond.

And then at last the rest of what had been sealed away is revealed. A flash from the inside of a wormhole. Of what he'd found out about the captain of his ship. That he was not quite a pirate. That he was a member of the Earthers Military. What's more, Raymond remembers reading the name 'Project Aurora' and that the name was utterly wiped from his mind. Until now.

Several minutes later, Raymond is wearing an armored space-suit. Its joints have been fused together, thanks to Jack's plasma torch. Its attachment rings have been rigged with support straps, clamping the armor firmly against the back wall of the hull. Or rather the floor, since the ship's acceleration is along its horizontal axis, and artificial gravity is disabled. It would take a rather potent telekinetic talent to escape this trap, and Jack has a further precaution against that - the trauma-maintenance kit in the suit is filled with Morphazine, set to remotely activate, and Jack's finger is on the button. Only then does he issue further orders - "we're goin' back to the military, Emily."

"Jack, Jack, Jack," says Emily. "You are one paranoid nutcase, you know that?" she teases. "And I had no idea you were into that kinda thing. But sometimes a girl can enjoy a bit of, well, you know..." She is, in a word, incorrigible.

"A bit of what? Personal safety?" retorts Jack. "I take the steps I deem necessary for my own protection, and for that of my crew. This isn't paranoia, it's just good sense. When you have a fly, you use a fly-swatter. Against a robber, use a gun. Against a tank, use a bazooka."

"Against a man who might be crazy, use a.. umm.. prison?" Emily laughs softly and shrugs to herself. "So what are the brass going to do for us, Jack?" Not that she minds military. They are so much fun to flirt with!

After a while, a rather confused emotional state will become readily apparent within Raymond's mind. He all of a sudden screams, a rather afraid scream as all of a sudden he deals with the new memories. Then, as the memories have been released, his mind relaxes, and he finds himself feeling rather angry. "Jaaaack..." he moans, and makes the attempt to move, "Jack?! What the... help? Somebody... help!"

"It's okay," the spacer, from the other end of the cargo bay. "This is for your own protection, and ours. I'll decline to tell you what precautions we took, also for your own protection. But you're safe, and I intend to keep you that way."

"Alright..." Although he's quite unused to the sensation of being unable to move. It's got him near to hyperventilating. "What do you want now? Huh?"

Emily hmmss and says over the link, "Just calm down, Raymond. I think everything will be just fine." Or she hopes so, anyway. She would hate to lose a loyal subject. "If you are good I'll sing a few songs for you."

"Now? Now we head somewhere," replies Jack, calmly. "I'll tell you about it when we get there." He sounds almost cheerful, now that the situation seems well in hand. The layers of his psychic defenses are in place, in the event the unknown attacker decides to try for a less immobilized target. In the event of Emily's take-over, he's made arrangements... "Take your time, you've got a head full of data."

And with that Raymond falls silent. Not relaxed, no, but he's busy assimilating this previously unremembered data. Some of it has him quite angry. "Alright Jack," he says at last, "What do I have to do?"

Jack chuckles. "Not much you CAN do, at this point. So just relax, meditate, introspect, hum rhymes to yourself, do whatever you're inclined to do."

With her usual lazy grace, Emily guides the ship through the jump gate, making her way down the trade lanes. After a moment, though, her normal ease is disturbed. "Jack, we've got some friends chasing like dogs," she announces. "They are trying to be sneaky, too." Not succeeding, of course, but trying!

"Act like they're succeeding," is Jack's considered advice. "I suspect they're going to try to close sooner or later, and make telepathic contact. If I can learn what's going on at that time, good. Be ready to turn on the stealth suite and make a quick getaway, though."

"Roger," says Emily. She maintains her heading and snickers to herself. "I really wish I could just blow these guys out of the sky, though," she adds, muffling a yawn. One would think she's totally relaxed. She is.

Jack hmmms. "That's not a bad idea, actually. Use passive sensors only, but see if you can get firing solutions on them. If we need to open fire, let's be ready to do so."

Emily arches an eyebrow. Jack actually wants her to shoot someone? Interesting. "Okay. Will do. You know what we need to get someday are some quality missiles. Oh, and you know, you should feed Raymond some complete bullshit about plans while you are at it. Tell him we'll use nukes or something if we get in trouble?"

Speaking of blowing guys out of the sky... the _Fast Buck_ shakes a little as it is rocked by the trade lane's support rings being blown to smithereens. This drops the speed of the ship down a good bit as they close in, with weapons powered up. Two laser bursts arc through the air, missing by mere inches.

Jack reads the near misses on his handheld, and frowns. "Stealth, evasion," he snaps out. _Guess they opened with violence. Or these aren't our guys.._

Emily smirks, making the Fast Buck move like a serpent, changing direction in a way that would dazzle the eye and confuse the mind. With a snorts she activates stealth, but it's clear. She wants to shoot someone today. "Stealth on. But I'm telling you Jack, one more shot and I'm making some space garbage of our friends."

"Leave one, if you have that option," recommends Jack, calmly monitoring his ship's progress through the void. "We're not sure who these guys are yet."

The shuttlecraft break off in a search pattern. They are moving very fast for ships of their make, and the scanners on the _Fast Buck_ will register that the weapons remain powered up. Two of them seem lost, though the third, through accident or design is barrelling along an intercept course with Jack and Emily.

With an angry burst of yellow from the erupting fuel cel, the unlucky shuttle bursts asunder with a well-placed blast. "Well, Jack, if they keep this up I don't know if I can keep the deal about that one survivor, but I'll try to play more gently with the third. You might want to hold on rather tightly." She hmms and adds, "These guys are either in suits or they aren't breathing. No gas ignition from the explosion. Remote controlled, possibly." She'll try to keep herself away from the other two, but at the same time she's getting ready to destroy the next one that draws close.

Seeing the results of the initial attack, Jack frowns. "Shoot to disable rather than destroy," he advises. "Go for their guns." And he begins typing out orders into his computer, glancing up to inspect Raymond every few seconds, staying vigilant.

Emily smirks to herself. The ship is just like a song, and as she darts through the sky a bright lance of light connects her ship to the enemy for just a moment. With a burst of light the shuttle's weapon is reduced to scrap. As if it were all as natural as waking Emily draws the ship into a wild turn, practically slaloming around the bursts of her enemy.

Emily slips through another series of shots and returns fire. "Wow, he dodged." She actually laughs. This is fun to her! "Well, let's try this, shall we?" With a gut-wrenching shift she changes directions and brings her gun about for the next volley, and this time she plans on ending this.

Jack directs a few commands to the pursuing shuttlecraft, chuckling like a madman. "Gotcha!" he crows. "Emily! Leave that last boat alone, we have what we need! Get us out of here, fast as you can!"

Emily replies to Jack, "You got it!" With a little evil grin she takes the time to blow the fleeing shuttle into kibble. "You did say just one," she explains, already gunning it and moving away from this place. In the back of her head, she'll pretend that Jimmy was on there. Yeah. That makes her go to her little happy place.

Emily finds the rest of the trip terribly boring. About the only thing Jack hears for the longest time are her yawns over the radio. Finally she says, "Nice work with that ship, by the way. We might finally have a clue what is going on. At least, I hope. They might be smart enough to only send stupid drones." She frowns, "I hope they are stupid masters and smart drones."

Through a little more expert piloting, and through quite the fancy display of piloting, the _Fast Buck_ manages to reach the edge of Earther Space uneventfully. The buildings here are unusual. The architecture doesn't have the sort of organic feel to it, instead everything is starkly mechanical and efficient. As they pass through the EartherGate, they will be in range of the _Nautilus_. Sensor and Weapons range, it should be noted. The imposing form of this ship dwarfs the _Fast Buck_ yet its weapons are not powered up. At least not now. They greet the new arrival with an automated hail. "Welcome to Earther Space. Please state your business and destination. Enjoy your stay."

"Jack Southport and crew, of the free trader _Fast Buck_, here on business with the Earther military," that worthy reports. He considers for a moment. "As well as towed scout craft."

After a moment or two there is an automated 'please enjoy your visit' message sent once more as they are given the greenlight to pass into Earther Space. A map can be downloaded off of the newsnet easily enough. The nearby Texas Shipyard serves as an important military establishment that is near the _Fast Buck_

The Texas Shipyard is a vast orbital facility. The zero-g construction sites are well maintained and constantly abuzz with activity. Here and there a ship is docked, most of them militarily, though there is the occasional trader, sure to make a killing trading goods to the relatively isolated shipyard. It takes a moment, but Jack and Emily are cleared to dock. "Welcome to the Texas Shipyard."

Only now does Jack consult with Raymond. "Alright. We're at the Texas Shipyard," he reports, with a smile. "What do we do now? Who can we talk to?

"Yaaaay," says Emily. She muffles another yawn. "So what now, Jack?" she asks curiously. She'll get out of the pilot's seat and stretch a bit. She blows off her fingers and adds in her usual, cocky fashion, "Yep, my little babies still have it." She just has to strut her stuff, even if she's the only one present.

Raymond is fine. Really. At least fine as anyone can be in the situation he's in. "Well I don't know too much about the Shipyards... I suppose you'd ask to speak to the CO. Usually a Fleet Captain, or Colonel or something like that."

Jack relays this to the shipyards' automation, mentioning only a matter of 'importance and urgency'.

After a few minutes, a slightly annoyed looking aide, a Lieutenant Jakobs, will contact the ship. "Colonel Henderson is busy at the moment, is there something I can do to assist you?"

The spacer smiles, casually. "I've got a guy here, says he's associated with something called Project Aurora," he says, after verifying the encryption on his connection. "He took a wrong turn somewhere and seems to think people are after him."

Emily will keep her attention on the ship they are 'towing' while Jack speaks. If that thing even hints at danger it'll be paste. She's just got this sudden, bad feeling.

The Lieutenant nods, "Alright. You are aware of the penalties for tying up official frequencies of course," states the Lieutenant as he signs off, and puts his call through to the top Brass. There's a smug 'hahaha you broke the rules and are in trouble for wasting my valuble time' smile on the Lieutenant's face just as he disappears from the screen. The look on his face when he actually speaks to the colonel is priceless. Within one minute of this, the Colonel himself has responded, requesting permission to come aboard alone and unarmed.

"I'd actually prefer you bring a few armed guards, for reasons that will become abundantly clear," suggests Jack, and signs off. "Emily, stand by at the airlock, we're expecting guests. I'm not moving one inch from looking at our guest until he's no longer our problem."

"Dammit Jack," says Emily, frowning deeply. "You didn't even get me a chance to change!" She actually sounds offended. "This is hardly a way to meet a.. what rank are these guests again?"

Within five minutes the Colonel and five armed guards are at the docking bay with the _Fast Buck_. The guards are armed, as is the Colonel, and all look extraordinarily wary. "Alright Captain, we're here..."

Jack gestures toward the back, where Raymond is imprisoned in the sealed space-armor. Slowly and methodically he sums up: "Raymond Garaeg. Contracted to go 'anywhere'. We found him in an area called the badlands, before. He's got a telepathic compulsion waiting in his mind, he's a walking target for take-over by remote. I immobilized him with his consent and brought him here. He lost some memories and got 'em back somewhat, and he knows who probably did this to him."

Emily will just do the listening this time. She's going to stay out of this. Besides, she's more interested in dashing, handsome, young Captains than Colonels. And she's woefully under-dressed to make a good impression.

"Alright." Mutters the Colonel, slowly. He looks towards the space-armor that is clamped to the floor. With a nod, his men will move towards the suit, "Make sure he's okay boys. What is it you want me to do for you Captain Southport? I'm sure we can come up with a substantial reward for the return of a misplaced and displaced citizen."

"Glad you mentioned that," grins Jack. He begins ticking off expenses. "There's the arranged transit fee - distance travelled, which our ship's records can compute precisely. The cost of a new set of space-armor. There's a shuttle behind us with a robot of some kind - it may provide a clue. I want the shuttle, you can have the robot and the shuttle's computer records if you want. Oh, and one final thing... any data pertaining to our future safety in this matter. I don't want to get killed because of some top-secret military project."

"Of course of course. That is entirely understandable Captain Southport." The Colonel has a look of intense relief on his face as Jack rattles off expenses. "I shall have all of these fees processed and paid for, just come up with a list of how much it costs, and as for the data... well I'll see what I can dig up for ya."

Jack smiles graciously. "I'm a Mindsman, and I don't talk," he says. "I made telepathic contact with this man. Make arrangements with my organization if you require erasure of anything. Aside from that, I'm happy with money. This is your problem now," he adds, gesturing toward Raymond. "Hope we were of some service."

There're more than a few sounds of protest coming from the fused and sealed space armor. Raymond's emotional state is a very upset one now as the guards move in around him, and begin the process of hauling the armor out from where it is. "Just come with us and we'll take good care of you," comments one of the guards.

Jack frowns, and holds up a hand. "Hey, wait a minute, Colonel," he says. "This guy... what's going to happen to him?"

Emily frowns, looking oddly worried. She's known military guys before. Serious, devoted. Nuts. She also has an inherent distrust (bordering on hate) of any large policing agencies. This suddenly seems like a very bad idea, and the stuff she's picking up off Raymond makes her very nervous. She's already trying to figure out the odds of blasting her way out of here without dying. Pretty damn slim.

The Colonel turns and informs Jack, gruffly, "I'm afraid that's classified sir. I am not authorized to reveal that information at this time. I'm sorry, but that's the way things are. I'm sure its data pertinent to your continued survival though, so as soon as I get your data all packed up, you'll know." This last bit is whispered, and barely audible to anyone except Jack and Em.

Jack frowns, and shakes his head. "That's not good enough. Is this man in any danger from you?" he demands.

The Colonel is worried. This much is clear to Jack. To Emily it's a little clearer. He's worried about what will happen when he brings this man aboard his ship. He's worried about what will happen to him, about what will happen with Jack and Emily, and about what further actions he shall have to take. He is also lying when he replies to Jack, "No."

Jack shakes his head. "Not acceptable," he grates, scowling. "Don't screw with a telepath, my friend. If something he is is a danger to you, you can deal with that. If something he knows is a problem, it can be erased without harm to him. But don't sit here and lie to me about a man who hired me to keep him safe."

With his best poker face, the Colonel replies "I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about. Guards, escort our man off of this ship, and please proceed to recompense these two for their trouble."

Jack speaks more loudly. "Are you listening? Hey, hey," he says, gesturing at the guards. "Just hold up. Colonel, just what is the problem? Whatever it is, it can be made right without harm to anyone."

(( Jack, he's lying about the danger! )) Emily sends quickly. She doesn't have much to say, and she's not too eager to try her hand at the military, though seeing the man who called her 'queen', even in jest, put in danger for her profit strikes a particularly uncomfortable chord.

Jack frowns. (( Yes, I just realized that when they started to cart him off, )) he transmits grumpily. (( We can't take these guys on directly, I'm afraid. But we'll do whatever we can. ))

The Colonel stonewalls, "I have heard you well enough Sir. This is a Military Affair, and I must ask that you please not interfere with it any further."

Jack scowls. "No, it's MY affair until I've taken payment. Now you can come with me while I sort this out with the civil authorities, if you want."

"Very well then sir. We were glad to hear that you accepted our payment and relinquished our man to us, thus completing our contract." A credit voucher is then dropped at Jack's feet. "You'll find your amount there. If you need further convincing that our business is through I am afraid you will have to talk to my men." He gestures to the guards, who have their guns trained on Jack and Emily.

"You have a choice here Captain Southport. I urge you to make the right one."

Jack frowns. "Well then," he remarks. "We'll be taking our shuttle and leaving," he says. "Colonel, you can make an appointment to collect on that data-collection offer. And remember our terms were for receipt of data from the shuttle's computer, not an offer to erase or tamper with anything. Emily, let's be off."

Raymond is understandably worried as he is carted off. He is not upset. At least not with Jack. There is one thing though, an attempt to make contact with him. He is focusing on one thought, (( Contact Tom Haversford, Earther ship Illiad. ))

(( Jack, we have to get the hell out of here, and fast. )) Emily frowns. (( I think Raymond might be okay. But if we stay around, I think we'll be dead. We know too much already, and we might not be useful enough to keep around. ))

(( I agree whole-heartedly, )) sends Jack. (( Now let's see if my big mouth lets us get away in one piece.. ))

The Colonel then escorts Raymond off the ship. He shoots Jack a worried glance, then departs for himself. There will be no further word from the Colonel after this. At least not over any public channels.

Once out in deep space, Jack begins examining his options. "We need to get a dump of that robot's brain, pronto," he says, "before the Colonel recovers from his shock and remembers that I told him he could have it. Emily, get a move-on while I work."

Emily does just as she is told. She's trying not to feel too bad about Raymond. She mutters softly, "If you get yourself hurt I'm going to shoot you!" She makes a mental note to deck the next military man she runs into.

Meanwhile, Jack is busy working with his computers, at an almost feverish pace. The shuttle's own records, and the data-structures in the robot's brain, are being fed into the prodigious vaults of his own ship's network, and kept in a safe area. "We have time before we head back to get our hands on that crypto software," he muses. "I'd say we should check out this guy on the Illiad next, Emily. I'm not going to let one of my clients get hurt just because some soldier got spooked."
