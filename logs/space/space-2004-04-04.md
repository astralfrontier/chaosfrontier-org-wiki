# Space 2004-04-04

The robot brain is complicated, but it can be decoded. It contains memories of where it had been created, a research station not listed on any starmap, although the coordinates it has recorded for it, place the station somewhere deep within the 'badlands'. According to the information gleaned, its purpose is to function as a pilot for Project Aurora, awaiting the installation of something called a PCE in its cerebral processors. It has a detailed map of the known stargates, and an encyclopedic assortment of knowledge regarding Wormholes, as well as their creation. There are numerous records on Project Aurora, including a list of command protocols that can override it as well as the names of its creator and a list of its missions so far. Its last mission was escorting something labeled 'GRETEL' but that mission was cut short and instead it was reassigned to the retrieval of key personnel. It also has a copy of a transmission that will be sent out to all Earth Military command personnel shortly.

That message is to be on the lookout for three known traitors, members of an organization called the 'Sons of Gaia'. They are to be captured or killed. Their names: Raymond Garaeg, Jack Southport, and Emily Petulengro.

The Illiad is a less imposing figure. At least as far as Heavy Cruiser types go. Its assigned someplace close by at present, part of its shakedown tour-of-duty. The Illiad has long been rumored to be some sort of experimental prototype, but its recent activation and public displays have done much to discredit those. Tom, luckily enough is one of the communications officers, and the one that is responsible for hailing the _Fast Buck_. "This is officer Tom Haversford of the Earth Ship Illiad. Identify yourself please."

"This is the _Fast Buck_," replies Jack, frowning as he considers the message. "I'm a representative of the Mindsmen, here on personal business. Officer Haversford, I'd like to come aboard and speak with you when you're off-duty. But the sooner the better."

"Alright. We are always happy to oblige the Mindsmen. Welcome aboard. Docking bay 5 is free right now." And with that the docking bay begins to open, allowing the Mindsmen's ship access to the cruiser.

A few hours later, the officer will pipe in through the com frequency. "Alright. I'm not aware of any Mindsman business... I'm not in any kinda trouble am I?"

"Not you," replies Jack, cordially enough. "A gentleman named Raymond may be, though. Where can we talk that's secure?"

Emily will tag along and be as useful as possible. One way to do that is to of course change into the best clothes she can. Maybe she's hoping to snare herself a military man? For now, though, she stays quiet and studies Tom casually.

"There's a maintenance hangar down the corridors. Meet me there in five minutes. I'll make sure its clean. Make whatever preparations you need..." Tom will then sign off. Presumably to head to the maintenance bay.

The hangar is a good deal dimmer than the rest of the ship, likely because its running on emergency power only. Tom, or at least presumably the fellow who is Tom, waits near the door. "Alright, we won't have much time before power is rerouted here... make it quick. What's up?"

After gaining consent, Jack takes an extra step in caution, and begins telepathically transmitting a short summary of the events leading up to the crew's present circumstance. He outlines the mission to the Badlands, and focuses in-depth on the outcome aboard his ship earlier, when his client was taken.

Tom listens, well he tries to listen. He's not quite used to telepathic contact. He looks to Emily, then Jack, "Well... alright. Sounds like the Colonel was just kinda scared. About while back we had orders from the high-ups to our high-ups to be on the lookout for the words 'Project Aurora'. Classified information that... but it pays to be a comm officer. It pays very very well sometimes."

Jack nods slowly. He's alert for feelings of betrayal, but he proceeds anyway. "Alright. If possible, I want to help my client out. If you're the man who can help me do that, that'd be much appreciated."

"Yeah. What's in it for me?" That he hasn't been hauled in for questioning yet has him a little more trusting. "I mean... I can get you his release orders, but that's risky. I don't take risks when I've got nothin' to gain."

Jack spreads his hands. "That's between you and Raymond, though we might be able to do something for you, if you have a favor to ask."

Emily thinks this is her cue. She puts on a her best sad and pouty face and says, "We don't have a lot, sir, but our lives are in danger just for helping someone." She steps a bit closer and reaches out to set a trembling hand on the man's shoulder, "Surely you aren't going to abandon us? Maybe we can do something for you?"

"Alright. Well..." Tom thinks on this for a moment. "How about this. You guys'll owe me one. I'll call in that favor someday. But for now... I'll take this risk."

Jack smiles and nods, but decides to let Emily do most of the thanking.

Emily beams at Tom and presses against him as she holds his arm. "Thank you," she says warmly, practically nuzzling against his shoulder. "I'm sure we can do something useful for you in turn. We won't forget our debt."

"I won't," states Tom, trying his best to keep his voice a steady, composed tone. "Now..." and then the lights begin to flicker. "Shoot. Go back to your cargo bay. Head for Raymond, I'll have your orders sent by the time you get there."

Emily starts to draw away from Tom as the lights flicker, but has one last thing to do. After all, he's a nice guy, and he clearly likes her. Just before she heads off with Jack she'll move close and plant a soft kiss on Tom's cheek. She whispers, "I won't forget you!"

The Texas Shipyard looms ahead of the _Fast Buck_. It's a familiar sight, though there is no one aboard an armored space suit in the hold this time. The Colonel will hail Jack, "Am I glad to see you back... we just got word your friend's to be released. Sorry for all the trouble. I've got that info you wanted as well. Sorry for all the trouble. Come on in and pick him up if you'd like."

Jack actually smiles. "Yes, I'd appreciate that. We'll be right in," he transmits.

And so they'll meet. The Colonel has four glasses of his finest brandy poured and waiting for company when they arrive. "Here, sorry abotu that. Look I panicked. I remembered the name Aurora, and that it was something important. Had a bad feeling to it..." There's a disc on the desk. "This is what I'm cleared to release..." Raymond looks none the worse for wear, and considerably relieved to see the duo. He smirks, "Jack it's good to see you. Hello again your Highness."

Jack reaches for the disc once he's seen his client appears safe. "That's okay," he replies. "Everybody has their business to worry about, and people like me are always positioned in the middle. No harm done."

Emily has no thought of formality. She actually hugs "her loyal subject". Her voice is jovial as she says, "I'm glad to see you, and still in one piece!" She pretends to fuss over him for a bit, but lets up and smiles. "It seems we're meant to traipse around the world together a little bit longer, doesn't it?"

The Colonel will toss back a drink. "Alright... so what will you do now? Is there anything else I can do to help you guys out?" Raymond, for his part, is quietly relieved, and presumably fascinated by Emily's infinite beauty. Either that or he's staring out the viewport at the stars, and the two rapidly approaching ships.

Jack shrugs. "We're going to see where Raymond himself would like to go," he says, "and Em and I have a personal project and business opportunity to pursue at the earliest possible moment." This much is true - much more money needs to be made before the ship's fusion engines are the equal of its thrusters.

Emily notices the ships and raises an eyebrow. "Those guys sure are in a hurry," she says. "Anyway, yes, there's a lot to do, and we have to take care of Raymond properly." She frowns in thought. Those ships sure are in a hurry... She'll send over to Jack, (( I think we better get out of here very quickly.. ))

Jack nods. "Anyway, Colonel, I think we'd best be going," he says crisply, turning and beckoning for Emily and Raymond. "I apologize for the trouble, but all's well that ends well."

The hustle back to the _Fast Buck_ is fast and directed, and as Jack herds his crewmate and client aboard, the ship warms up in response to his directed computer commands. "Emily, get us out of here," he directs crisply. "Raymond, cabin. Get comfy for now and stay put. I'm locking the door for your safety, and ours."

Emily doesn't need much prompting. She'll fire the ship up and get out of here as quickly as humanly possible. "I bet these jerk-offs are changing their minds.. I hope Tom didn't get in trouble over this. God, to think I had believed these military guys would be fun!"

Raymond paces nervously, "It ain't over yet..." He keeps glancing back. Although nothing seems to be occuring. At least not yet. By the time anything happens, the gate has opened up, and the _Fast Buck_ has disappeard, out of system. By the time the stargate opens once more, letting two more ships pass through, in pursuit of their quarry, the bodies of every living being to have ever spoken or seen Raymond Garaeg in the Texas Shipyard lie dead.

The data disc given to Jack is worth tons. At first it seems to only have a few handfuls of data... but... Jack will recognize the significance of some of them. This Project Aurora has something to do with Psi-tech devices. It might take a little digging, but also in the file is every single name ever connected to Project Aurora. This data can be compared to the data downloaded from the robot brain to acquire a list of everyone involved with the project, where they are, and what they are doing, as well as their more shadowy dealings.

The spacer reviews this, then sits in his chair, contemplating and planning. The involvement of a high-level Mindsman is not too surprising, given the apparent nature of Project Aurora, but pursuing this lead could prove troublesome. Finally he docks the shuttle with the _Fast Buck_, drifts over, and physically disconnects the robot's power-pack and primary electrical pathways before lugging it back to his own ship. This done, he disengages the two vessels and stows the robot safely in a cargo module.

"Jack, we've got a bug," says Emily. "It's out there. Not sure if you want to destroy it or try to put it on a decoy. I'm thinking decoy might be nice, but could get a lot of people hurt. Maybe you can find out if it's a military gift?" She frowns in thought, "Don't know why they'd want to trace us, though."

Still in his armor, Jack makes for the airlock and hauls himself outside. "Get in and stay on the console," he directs. "I want you to make for a planet - a gas giant if you can find one, with plenty of radiation and thermal noise. Put yourself in a high orbit." He lugs his electronics toolkit open and begins rummaging. "Alright, you little bugger.."

Emily will do just as Jack says. She thinks she's getting his idea. "I think I have us a good one," she announces. "Plenty of static, nice and big, lots of magnetic interference due to the moons. Good iron cores, it would seem."

Popping the bug off his hull at last, Jack carefully jets outward, calculating his own ship's orbit as he goes. He soft-lands on a chunk of rock orbiting at approximately the same speed, attaches the bug, and jumps off again. Engaging his thrusters, he makes the quick trek back, all in the angry red eye of the gas giant's glare. "Alright, Emily," he reports, "engage stealth, and take us out of here." He de-suits only after, stows his toolkit, and ambles toward the cockpit.

The asteroid is welcoming. Zinaida, as always has a port kept free for them. "Is good business firend Jack," he'll state. "Starcharts, engine parts, baboon hearts... whatever you need, I know how to find. Sometimes. Is not always certain." The older man will give them the nav data at cost, "Is anything else for you I can do?"

Jack waves his hands, smiling. "Oh, just a shuttle to sell," he says. "It's in good condition. Somebody aboard it attacked us, we defended ourselves, I claimed right of salvage and the pilot did not protest. You could even ask him about it if you wanted, but I don't think he'll say much. As far as I know, nobody else has an interest in it, and it's in good shape. I ah, wiped the computer, so you'll need your own software."

Zinaida rubs his bony hands together and laughs an almost wicked sounding laugh. "You have shuttle? Yes... is good..." He is practically beaming. "I have something for you that is good for unowned unmarked shuttle... is engine good for you?"

Jack hmms. "About the only thing we need now is a fusion plant. 220 megawatt minimum output, but 250 would be better. Have something in that range?"

"Yes yes..." Zinaida frowns. "Have two-twenty... is high-end for me though. Is done." He smiles, it's rather like a used-car salesman smile. "Is yours. Perhaps when things not so busy, you will help me in return. But engine is yours. Is here in 5 days."

Emily just leans back, lets Jack talk business. She's still a bit worried about things, but it's nothing she and Jack can't handle. She'll stretch lazily and plan out ways to make Jack's plan even more believable. She's a big mouth in most cases, so she'll blabber about going somewhere that he indicates, probably.

Jack shakes on it. "And the crypto software we asked for?"

"Jack my boy... is here. Have with me." Zinaida reaches into the pocket of his suit, pulls it out in a whithered hand and passes it on to Jack. "Anything else you need?"

Jack shakes his head. "That'll do it. I think for the moment we can wait a week here. If trouble comes our way, we may have to leave in a hurry, of course..." He frowns, approaching a delicate subject. "There's another matter. I want the ship hidden away. Records... obscured. I'm willing to pay a little for the convenience and a lot more if it actually pays off."

Zinaida leans in, getting a rather sharkish grin now. "Yes... this can be done. Your ship will disappear. No one will find you if you like. Is of course expensive... but can be done..."

The transmission Raymond managed to record is a curious one indeed. It consists of someone relating coordinates back, followed by, "I've managed to secure our course for the next few days. We'll be able to rendezvous soon enough. Unfortunately I think that they know about the astropath we kidnapped. I recommend a clean-sweep. I fear the project may be exposed."

While poring over the data, Jack begins to realize that this does not qutie explain how Raymond captured the transmission. It's probably something dreadfully important.

Fortunately he's more involved in thinking about the Mindsmen connection. What do Project Aurora and an astropath have in common, he muses.

Jack contents himself for the rest of the time by purchasing a heavy laser assembly for his ship, and mounts for three more. He lacks the power to drive four at full thrust, and he despairs of his available tonnage and volume figures when looking at the new engines and power plant. But, that's progress.

Emily will return to Jack with a rather sad look on her face. "God, but I can't believe it. All those good hands for this?!" She offers Jack the money, "Ugh, it's.. it's horrible. I hope it at least covers something, though."

Jack examines Emily's earnings with greasy hands. He glances up at the half-dismantled turret, and smiles. "That's just about how much that bugger cost," he observes. "Good work."

About three days into the five-day wait, Zinaida will come down to the docking bay. He'll call Jack and Emily on the com frequency, "If I can offer business, I have some for you. If you have time during this waiting..."

"In two days, when ship comes in... they bring supplies, yes. They bring more than they leave here. Is certain cargo aboard, a crate about so big..." He gives the dimensions of a fairly small crate. "If you can find destination for me... I can make it worth your while..."

Jack hums thoughtfully. "You have no port of call in mind, then?" he asks, curiously. "I'm no slouch at developing new markets, depending on what it is I'm peddling.."

Zinaida chuckles. "Ohh no, you misunderstand friend..." Zinaida pauses a moment, mouthing something rather rapidly, looking quite thoughtful. "I want you to... er... em... what are words... ah yes, find for me where cargo is going."

Jack frowns. "That's a bit outside of a free-trader's area of expertise," he says, contemplating. "And you understand I have my good reputation to think about. But I think.. under the right circumstances.. it could be done. How urgent is it?"

"I understand is a little... tricky..." Zinaida chuckles, "But I know you. Are a capable man. Resourceful. And you," he says, turning to Emily, "As clever as beautiful. Is easy for the two of you I am sure. As for reputation... what is reputation? Is gossip... no one gossip here, no one talks... you not even exist now." Then Zinaida sinks back a little, "Is urgent yes... important. Worth... ehhmm... heavy laser to me."

Jack scowls. "I paid cash for one laser, and can barely drive two with my power plant," he points out. "However, the only other thing I have in mind is a bit out of anyone's price range for the moment, so I accept."

"Good good." Zinaida broadens his smile, and then turns. "Thank you for helping. You are good friend. Now if you will excuse me... have business to attend to."

---

For the next two days, Jack and Emily review their options. For Jack's part, a new skill, undeveloped heretofore, is being put to hard and relentless use. Time and again he works at exerting his teleportation gift on physical objects, until he can manage it at least semi-reliably. The data he's received suggest that physical means may be required if electronic means fail, and he's prepared for both.

It takes some intense work and preparation, but when that supply ship arrives, and the asteroid is bustling with activity, Jack and Emily are all set. Everything has fallen into place, and when the ship docks, they are able to slip aboard, along with the station's workers, who are unloading specified cargo...

The freightliner is massive. Its easy to see why they'd pay for protection here in the outskirts of space. It'd be too easy to prey on it, but... they make it safely here and there. It's not hard to spot out the crew of the ship, they're the ones who look ready to burst from cabin fever. Jack and Em can find their way past them and get aboard the ship easily enough. The crew compartment of the ship is relatively small. It consists of crew quarters and two officer's quarters, and the bridge. There's a stretch of hallway linking them together.

Jack squeezes into a maintenance duct, his portable computer with him. He finds an access point, then waits patiently. In telepathic contact with Emily, he awaits the signal to commence. (( Let me know when the crew is mostly off and you've got his attention.. ))

Emily will wait for a good time to bump into the science officer. "Hey there," she says warmly, offering a polite nod. "You are with the merchants, aren't you? If you are interested, I could show the sights, provide a little entertainment. Maybe get rid of that tired look on your face?" She adds an extra purr to her voice, hinting that she's open to just about any suggestion.

"Uh-huh..." The science officer looks up, a little disbelieving look on her face. Rather suspicious as well. Her hand rests on the needler pistol, but it's an absent-minded gesture. "Is that what you're really after? I can't give deals on cargo."

"I don't have any money for cargo," says Emily, laughing softly. "Come on, let's go relax a bit. What do you want most of all right now? Sit and have a drink, maybe? Hmm, I can find you some good music, too. Or would you rather have a warm bath? You look rather tense."

"Uh... the drink sounds fine." The officer shakes her head a little, "I'm not tense. Just... busy. Have all these repairs due, and manifests to readjust..."

Emily nods slowly, "Of course. I imagine it's a lot of work." She will lead the way eagerly, working out the way this officer works upstairs. What she wants is what Emily wants to know all about. "I bet you've seen all kinds of places, huh?" says Emily.

"Oh I've seen a few places. Mostly these stupid fringe worlds. I'm Anna," she says, with a sigh. She thumbs through some of the paperwork, and says, "Well... I suppose I have a few minutes to spare. If you're buying."

"Of course I can buy, Anna," says Emily. "I'm Amelia, by the way. You can just call me Amy, though, if you like. It's a lot shorter. My mother picked the name." She sighs and shakes her head, "All those thoughts of grandeur and look where I am now." She keeps on leading the way, though, doing her best to make Anna forget all about that stupid paperwork.

"Yeah... this place ain't so bad. You should see some of the bordermoons out here. Some of 'em can barely afford to pay for their supplies... old moons, terraformed a ways back. Now look at 'em. Populated... sure, but..." Anna will ramble on for a while, eager to forget about the paperwork.

Meanwhile, Jack is grumbling to himself, cursing his glasses, cursing the Mindsmen who've laid such heavy strictures on him, cursing the Earther military that's brought him to such lows of personal morality and such dangerous consequences.. He receives Emily's mental message and gets to work, doing what he can to access the hauler's records quickly and surreptitiously.

Jack quickly notes down the data he receives. 'Sheriff Ganfrey, moon of Cygnus, two weeks' filters into his computer's memory, along with any sundry notes or special instructions he can find attached to the record. This done, he assiduously erases the evidence of his break-in, then focuses on a point several dozen yards distant, a point he'd focused on and memorized earlier.

It takes a failure and several minutes of rapid breathing, mental preparation and confidence-building, but Jack manages to teleport himself at last to his prepared spot outside the ship. His heart is racing quickly and he adjusts his glasses nervously on his face, before trotting off to find Zinaida.

And so Jack reports back to Zinaida in his office. He's quite pleased to see the free-trader and will listen with interest while Jack relates his tale. Meanwhile, Anna will listen with interest to 'Amy' as she is kept busy. The whole thing is a brilliant success, they will likely never realize anything had happened. And so, another day comes to a close...
