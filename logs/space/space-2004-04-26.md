# Space 2004-04-26

The engine is practically humming, even before it's installed. Two-hundred and twenty megawatts of power, now installed in the _Fast Buck_, begin to course through its circuits. Zinaida is happy, he's done business, the gamblers on the station are happy, Em might be leaving soon, and it is likely that Jack and Em will be happy, as they and their ship no longer exist, in a manner of speaking. Not in any official capacity, anyway. Zinaida says, "Thank you Jack, Emily, your work is appreciated. You are good friends. When you are wanting back in records... let me know."

Jack shakes hands with the businessman, exchanging pleasant farewells. He leads the way back to the ship, boarding and sealing the locks before speaking. "You noticed what was said about an 'astropath', and the cryogenic container we got before," he begins. "I think there's a connection. I think the Mindsmen know what that infant was. I'm not sure if they were there to retrieve it, or there working with whoever had it."

Emily is busily preparing to get the new, improved bucket ready for the journey ahead. "You think that ice bady was an astropath, then?" asks Emily. She purses her lips, remaining oddly focused on this rather mudane task. "This is one weird life we're leading," she mutters.

Jack chuckles softly. "We've done okay for ourselves," he replies, gesturing about at the newly upgraded ship. "Anyway, get us out of the dock, and let's have a talk with our passenger."

With a return to her usual, easy posture, Emily draws the new ship away from the dock, soaring once again away from the comforts of a place that was, if for a short while, like a home to her. "So, once again we're really not sure what we're dealing with, but we're pretty much guaranteed to be in way over our heads." Emily makes that sound like a good thing.

For his part, Jack makes his way into the back and opens the cabin door. "Hey buddy?" he calls. "We're heading into space in a roundabout way, and I sincerely doubt anyone's got enough telepathic power to reach us where we're going, so you should be fine. Come on out and stretch your legs."

"Yeaah... stretching my legs would be great." Raymond nods, stretching out as he's released. So to speak. "So uhm, where exactly are we going?"

Jack shrugs. "We're going to see the Mindsmen again. I have some questions about this 'astropath' business. Our ship has been upgraded again. I want to hear about whatever shipboard skills you've got, as we may need you if we get into trouble."

"Mindsmen. Nothing but trouble if you ask me. But you didn't." He shrugs, looks around. "Well... I'm a decent communications guy, I can handle shipboard guns in a pinch, and I know my way around a cargo bay. I know a little about uh... boarding maneuvers. Heh."

Jack nods slowly. "Alright," he says. "If we get into trouble, and Emily's busy piloting, you're number two on guns. Now, check our systems out. I'll give you limited access." And with that he begins heading back to the front of the ship. "I'll have more questions later," he calls over one shoulder.

Space is vast. The _Fast Buck_ in comparison, isn't. It's an easy matter to take the scenic route, and avoid civilization in its entirety. At least until it's time to go find the Mindsmen...

Reaching the Mindsmen however, is another easy task. There's a rather well-ensconced Mindsmen office located on an asteroid that anchors a tradelane's route. Conveniently, it's within Earther space, but not terribly close to much. It's an on the way station. Jack and Em are welcomed with open arms. Well, an open dock port. Sara Nagati, the head telepath, contacts the two. "Hello. Is there anything we can help you with? We don't have much in the way of... company traffic."

Jack spends some time explaining the entire situation, in as much depth as he can muster. He produces Raymond, as well, outlines some of the issues the ship and its crew have dealt with thus far, and at long last, as his voice is running out of steam and his thoughts are growing wavery, concludes his tale of woe. "... So essentially I want this monkey off my back, and off the back of my ship. The Mindsmen sent me out there into the badlands, and that's when all the trouble started."

Emily will tag along, just to listen. She is wondering when Jack will get to the part where the mindsmen owe them a lot of money, though. That's the important part, isn't it?

"This is a serious matter, if what you say is true." Ms. Nagati holds up her hands, "And I believe that it is true. I'm not quite sure what it is you'd have me do? I could contact the military, send in some of our screamers to bring the man down. Although my resources aren't as expansive as they once were. I'll do something about it. In the meantime, Captain Southport, what will you do?"

"What will I do? Take care of my client," replies Jack, looking glum. "This is not my affair. These are matters I have no training, investment or interest in. I got into this because of a contract I undertook for you, that I also completed, and so I will at least see it through to the end. But I can't do it on my own." He turns to Raymond. "Whatever was going on out there, you apparently have useful friends inside the military apparatus. Is there anything you can add to this?"

Raymond shakes his head. "Not much. This whole business has most of my friends, the ones in high places anyway, kinda frightened." Ms. Nagati cuts in, "That's all well and good, but if you can organize them, perhaps make sure that this data is sent to the right people..." Raymond nods, and she continues, "Then I believe I can help solve the problem with you. I suspect that after putting up with all of this, Captain Southport, you are deserving of a fair bit of compensation."

Now someone is talking Emily's language. Compensation is good! Compensation means more gambling, clothes, and maybe even some better equipment on the Fast Buck. Probably in that order.

Jack chuckles softly. "I got paid for my earlier mission. If someone feels like hooking me up again, I have no objections. But let's talk about that after we find out if all this business actually pays out. Raymond, Ms. Nagati, Emily and I are at your disposal."

"Very well then. Allow me to make a few calls, and I shall get back with you. If you don't mind, Captain, I may just hire you and your crew..." Nagati nods, then begins sending out communications. "I'll contact you in a few days. We'll hide you here, if you'd like."

Jack nods and smiles. "That'd be much appreciated," he says, glancing at Emily to silently gauge her opinion of all this.

Emily nods to Jack, even though she whispers to him, "I bet they don't have any gambling here, huh?" Plus she probably wouldn't find mindsmen quite so easy to gamble with.

A few days pass, and the communications channels are abuzz with activity. On the fourth day after Jack's arrival, two military ships will arrive at the station. They do not open fire, nor do they begin boarding the station, instead they hail. Ms. Nagati will send for Jack and Emily. "The cavalry, so to speak, is here. If you are ready, I think I can use your help. Meet me in my office."

Two officer types are standing at attention in the office. Ms Nagati smiles, "We'll be heading out to Tau Alpha-4. It's an asteroid, and we believe this to be Project Aurora's headquarters. We're going to have to bring you in as prisoners. That should get you into position to lower their defenses. We have a virus here that should disable launching systems temporarily, if you can install that as well. The trick is getting you past the psi-scanners that are likely to be there..."

Jack blinks. "Hey, wait a minute," he says, ineffectively mounting a protest and raising his hands. "We're not commandos. And we're not going to be prisoners for real. What's going on?"

Emily raises an eyebrow and hums a rather odd tune as she listens to this. "You know, this sounds pretty dangerous. Why us? And how much?" And she's quite interested in the 'how much' portion of this quiz.

"I'm not talking to you, Captain." Ms. Nagati turns to Emily, "I will be paying you 'a lot' for your assistance. I was hoping that the two of you could help me get these gentlemen here, past their psi-scanners..."

Nodding, Jack relents. "Okay, okay. If that's the extent of our involvement, I'll do it, and Emily can decide for herself."

Emily shrugs and nods. A lot? What is this, kindergarten? She wonders just what she's supposed to do to help in this silly plan, though. She'll leave that thinking to Jack, for now.

"Good. I'm glad to have your aid in this. I'll not ask you to do anything you feel that you cannot handle." Ms. Nagati explains the layout of the station, including the four known telepaths who handle the scanning. "Interestingly enough, they're still kept on file here. Took some doing, but I have their profiles. Now, if you can get them past these four... the rest will be taken care of."

"Do the telepaths scan thoughts, or actively check for psi powers?" asks Jack. "If the former, a simple application of temporary Mindwipe should suffice."

"Both, I believe."

Jack thinks for long moments. "Stage an apparent prison-break, if these guys are going in as prisoners?" he suggests. "If they can get in while the telepaths are distracted, and complete their job, they can either leave immediately, or a two-stage temporary memory-erasure can restore them to apparent harmlessness after the task is done."

"Alright. How do you propose we stage the prison-break," asks one of the officers. Officer Roberts, from the nametag, anyway.

Jack scratches his head. "Well, we DO know some pirates...."

Emily runs a hand through her hair and hmmsss. This plan is sounding more and more bizarre. "So what do we know about the people doing the sweeping?" she asks. She's thinking this is going to probably be a lot more trouble than it's worth.

"Well... we know that they are likely as not in the pocket of Project Aurora. They aren't terribly skilled as fall as Psykers go. But they have a good bit of strength, at least in as far as it can be measured. The Psionic equivalent of bouncers, I suppose..." replies Nagati, shaking her head in an almost disbelieving manner. She hands the file to Emily for her review. It does tend to confirm that belief. An interesting thing she'll note though... one of these psi-scanners used to be a high-up in Jimmy Dalion's gang.

Jack gathers with Emily for a moment, using telepathy to briefly outline a plan of attack. At the end of the brief conference, he turns his attention back to the Mindsmen emissary. "Alright, here's what I propose..."
