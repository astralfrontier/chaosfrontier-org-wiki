# 759.wiki

Jiro stands in the front offices of Templar Technology Industries. The corporation is a defense contractor, associated principally with the Church of the Exiles of Eternity. Though he's come here before to work in the suit simulators, and has even operated some variants of the company's battlemover design, this will be his first fitting for an infiltration unit. He's met in the foyer by a woman wearing a grey suit, with her hair up. "Cleric Uzuki, welcome back," she says, primly. "Come this way." And gesturing, she leads the way through a door on the left wall. The rest of the building is in stark contrast to the pristine organization of the offices at front. Equipment pits, exo-skeletal frames for muscle testing, a few rare holographic displays interspersed with video wallpaper, and vats of production chemicals or racks of components organized by function. A number of industrial "drone" robots, with their multipurpose gripper arms, make their way across the floor of the combination factory, laboratory and garage. Two men, one grey-haired, the other with dark black hair and old-fashioned spectacles, are waiting. "Mr. Li, Mr. Kubota," says the woman, by way of introduction, and Jiro trades bows with the two founders of the company. "We've got your 14A ready, Cleric," says Mr. Li, smiling. "Come to our testing pod." The 'pod' the two men lead to is a large, white room built in one corner of the warehouse. Passing inside, Jiro sees a gleaming white humanoid figure, a super-alloyed white knight. "Does it always come in that color?" he asks, sounding a little tepid. "This is the production paint-job," explains Mr. Kubota. "We'll re-paint it after you've shaken it down. We don't have any sort of instant chameleon or camouflage coating yet; it was either that or the pan-emission cloaking. The 15A will probably have both." He stops speaking as Jiro approaches, reaching out to touch the surface. "Feels rough," he observes. "You're used to the model 13, right?" asks Mr. Li. "The 14A is a generation advanced from what you guys are using out in the field. Are you familiar with the series?" Jiro shakes his head, and Mr. Li continues, while Kubota begins making some adjustments to the armor and working on a hand-computer. "When TTI was first started, oh, forty years ago, we inherited something called the SXO. It was a pretty straight-forward design. Hydraulics and plastic muscles, zero-g steel construction, independent lifesupport. It was basically an armored space-suit. We needed things that worked on the ground a lot better. So we came out with the model 10, which was a reworking of the whole concept. Multi-layered armor to defeat shaped-charge bullets, plastic muscles throughout, more sensors. We actually got it right on the model 11. The model 12 is the unit you see in the Cosmos Units, it's pretty specialized. The 13 is what you guys use on the ground. The 14 still has a fairly narrow profile - no built-in propulsion in space, for example." Mr. Li gestures to the wall, where his business partner has called up a display. "Look at this. We built an all-new superstructure for the 14, which made the 14A possible. See here? Hexagonal cells, like a honeycomb. We run a low-level charge through each cell. The distribution of power determines the type, duration, and profile of the charge, and there's piezoelectric elements inside each cell. They absorb radar and radiated heat, and counter-vibrate to reduce the sonic profile of the armor. Here, you'll like this. The cells are glued together into layers, and layered together using this chemical formula you see shown here.." The man's finger indicates a spinning molecule of fair complexity on the video wallpaper. "We call it electroglue. Highly adhesive, conducts electricity, very tough. When something hits a cell, it collapses, so we preserve the composite effect to defeat shaped-charges and heavy attacks." Jiro examines the display, listening to technical specifications. At length, he speaks when an opening presents itself. "You innovated all this?" he asks, sounding a little surprised. Mr. Kubota chuckles and gestures at his partner. "We're two guys in a garage. Always have been. We have fourteen engineers and one administrative assistant, most of whom you've seen already. We've been supplying the Templars with their armor for four decades." "We have three things going for us," adds Mr. Li, continuing the thread of discussion. "First, all our software uses the goal-based programming paradigm. It's far superior to the actors-events model the Australites swear by, when it comes to writing control code for mobiles like this armor, or robots. It means we can plug in new equipment almost daily with minimal upgrades. We've had a standard bytecode dialect we've been shaking down for three decades and it's handled everything we've thrown at it. Second, we take advantage of things like Coulam's bio-engineering. Almost all our commodity components are grown by engineered bacteria or something similar - we use actual robot fabrication only for umm, the superstructure and the electronics and optics. Third, we insist on modularity. By now we're about 85% optimized as far as final weight and volume go, and the maintenance benefit more than makes up for that, in my judgement." Mr. Kubota gestures for Jiro to suit up, having finished the adjustments to the armor. Another thirty minutes ensue, as Jiro changes, climbs into the armor and holds still while the two founders carefully tailor its extremities to his measurements. Data are recorded; analyses are performed. Jiro answers questions about the comfort level, while the founders examine his medical history and profile it against the suit's own biomonitor output. At length everyone's satisfied, and the cleric begins shrugging his way out of the super-armor. "The ECM seems fairly specialized," remarks the captain. "Any reason for it?" Kubota nods, and explains. "A lot of these suits are designed to operate against drones or other robots, either military-programmed or rampant. Optical recognition is damned expensive, so a lot of automation doesn't use it. That's why we were willing to sacrifice the visual camouflage for a broad-spectrum electromagnetic and sound shield." Jiro nods, slowly, and asks a question he's been musing privately. "This isn't related to the business at hand, but I'm curious anyway, gentlemen," he says. "What is it like, doing your job?" Li and Kubota look at each other, exchanging the knowing smiles one only sees on life-long partners. It's Li who answers. "We're a life-saving organization, at bottom. The guys who wear our armor, who fight with our drones, who use our weapons? They're out there protecting the air processors and population centers. One crazy with a bomb can wipe out a civilization here. If we keep that in mind, our work will never falter. I don't need to tell you this, captain, but I hope you'll use our armor in that same spirit of preservation." To this Jiro could give no answer. He can only offer a firm handshake to both men, then make his way out of this peculiar, but highly important, building.
