# Synthetic Saints 2004-02-26

There is a long tradition in space missions of holding a press conference several weeks prior to launch. There is also a long tradition among the press to have, at best, only tepid interest. From your point on the dias at the front of the room, seated behind a long table with your crewmates and space agency administrators, you can see that the auditorium should be able to seat over 400 people. There's maybe fifty present, mostly junior reporters from the news agencies and broadcast networks of Ayer. Most are silent, scratching away at touchpads held in their hands as an official speaks.

The official is Oswald MacArthur, Director of the Space Agency of Ayer, and co-ordinator of the famed Aurora Project. MacArthur is seated at the center of the long table. The Aurora Crew is seated to his right; a few other senior administrators are seated to his left. MacArthur is finishing a recap of the Aurora mission profile - something he's done a hundred times over the past three years.

MacArthur drones on. "The primary mission objective of Aurora, is to re-activate three critical Stargates - starting with our own gate, of course; followed by the Gate in the Crossroads system, which is strategically located between our star, and New Queensland. At the time of the Crash, New Queensland had a population of almost a billion, and should have the technical expertise necessary to restore our atmosphere processors to operation."

Jiro Uzuki is of middling height and weight, a contrast to the bulkier soldiers modern chemistry is so apt to produce. His dark, almost severe uniform seems cut for comfort but little else. Even his hairstyle is similarly short and efficient. Only his face betrays some sign of culture or elegance. The eyes are not the hard and soulless gaze of the killer, nor the restrained madness of the gun-toting grunt. They look beyond what they see. He listens quietly for now, placid as lake water, for he is in his element.

Archer keeps the smile fixed on his face, but privately holds some serious reservations about that. _If the Crash didn't wipe their tech base out completely. But we've got to start somewhere, and if they're intact, they'll remember us._ Archie Collins is about average height, 5'8", and carries a noticeable amount of extra weight on his frame. He's not actually paunchy, but he does look a bit chunky. He has the typical tan complexion of most Ayerans, and unusually pale blond hair, almost white, which contrasts strongly with his skin. His eyes are pale grey, shifting to blue or green on occasion depending on the light. He's dressed in a formal dark-gray pilot's uniform."

Leandra sits calmly, trying to still herself. Even so, she hooks a finger in the collar of her blouse, as if the fabric were somehow chafing her. Realizing she is fidgeting, the woman stops herself calmly. It is the stares that likely bother her. She stands out, with the fine points of her ears and her curved eyes she is hardly going to pass herself as anything but one of the Coulam.

Oi, or more formally, Argestes, looks quite relieved to be out in open air. Out of his gilded cage. He's neither tall nor short and his hair is longish. A pair of modified spectacles rest atop his nose, whirring every now and again with some hidden activity going on. A grin, typical of most Australites is worn as a part of his uniform. Dark green eyes flutter every now and again as thoughts and problems present themselves and are solved. _Heh. You know, it'd be rather interesting to hack the cameras, patch in... er... nahhh better not._ He glances at his teammates, gives a bit of a shrug. _Well then... let's see what's what._

MacArthur touches a spot on the datapad in front of him, and a holographic display on the right wall comes to life. It shows a map of Ayer, with a spot in the arctic region highlighted. "Since the Aurora team will be operating in isolation for months at a time, they've been training to work as a team in a variety of situations. To that end, they've volunteered to assist the atmosphere processor project on a reconnaisance mission to a deserted geothermal power station, shown here. This will both give them the opportunity to train in a 'live' environment, and directly aid in the re-activation of the processor at the Coulam colony."

MacArthur stops and rubs his eyes before continuing, and looks out across the room towards one of the reporters. "So I really don't understand your question, Mister Fischer. I would think that the benefits of the mission are quite clear."

Archer turns his attention in the same direction as his nominal boss. _Eh? One of those daft cobbers who just can't stand the Coulam, maybe? Wonder who he's stringing for?_

Fischer stands in the middle of the near-empty auditorium. Several other reporters and camera operators watch him as he speaks. "Many people belive that we can repair our atmosphere processors without the aid of other worlds. Six of the twelve stations have been brought back on-line already. If the Aurora team succeeds, then the Coulamite processor will make seven. So, why send them into space at all? Why expend all this effort?"

_You'd think these guys would understand all of this. I swear these questions are getting dumber and dumber. Next they'll be asking why should we even bother trying to find what's happened to our old comrades, or what we might find. New technology... hrmmm. Gonna have to remind myself to mess with this... Fischer fellow. He needs to learn about The Game._ Oi fidgets back and forth in his chair, looking towards Jiro as he fields the question.

A pair of nods are exchanged, and the young Lieutenant rises, clearing his throat. "Mr. Fischer, imagine that your family was isolated from any other. I don't expect you have a doctor in your house. If a member of your family became sick, you'd be very much out of luck. Similarly, if the planetary governments isolated themselves, I can name three ministers from memory who'd be dead, if it weren't for the retroviral cures Coulam offers. Isolation in any dynamic system is a prelude to stagnation, followed by death. We of the Aurora team believe the cost of the mission is a fair price for the value of every life on this planet."

Leandra, for her part, says nothing. She doesn't even turn her gaze towards the one asking. She is simply listening to the questions of a people as alien to her as she is to them. She manages to hold herself with perfect posture and yet look relaxed. The end result is that she appears slightly taller than her small 5'4" frame truly is.

Archer starts to answer, when Jiro pre-empts him. He waits for his partner to finish, then clears his throat. "And I might add, Mr. Fischer, that back in the last years of the Pre-Diaspora, people asked that same question. We need to explore so that folks can find new things and meet new challenges. If the Americans of NASA had agreed to stay on the ground back then, none of us would be here."

Fischer quirks an eyebrow, but sees no further comments are forthcoming. He sits, apparently satisfied that he's made a good faith effort to create controversy.

MacArthur taps at his pad again, and the display shifts. "As you probably have heard, one of our biggest challenges in reactivating an atmosphere processor is ignition. Once in operation, the fusion reaction is self-sustatining, generating enough power to continue the process. However, a critical amount of energy is required to exceed break-even. A century ago, we'd have used a quantity of antimatter... which is in short supply and needed for the Gate project. Recent expeditions have discovered that the power grid between Coulam and the geothermal station at Icereach may be intact, but dormant. If we can re-activate Icereach, it will remove the need to rebuild the power grid between Coulam and Domwun, and save months of time and billions of dollars."

MacArthur continues for a few more minutes, as the holographic display shifts to show maps of the power station, an atmosphere processor, and the Coulam region of Ayer. To say that Icereach is close to Coulam is a stretch, and only true because Ayer is sparesly populated. The actual distance appears to be some four hundred miles across savannah that turns into tundra at its northern extent, and finally into Ayer's thin ice cap.

The reporters are mostly silent as MacArthur speaks. Some record the proceedings on visor-cameras, some by tapping on handheld data pads. None seems excessively interested.

MacArthur winds up his presentation. "Of course, full transcripts and sensor logs of the expedition will be made available to mission sponsors after the team returns. I believe most of you already have arrangements for documentary rights; otherwise, please contact our archives department. Our next briefing will be in seven days, when the fuel skimmer project will make its report. That is all."

The reporters file out of the room, and MacArthur loosens his tie. As the last leaves, he prods a button on his pad, and the lock on the auditorium door clamps shut with a soft 'snik'.

"Unbelievable," he says. "Eight centuries in space... and the newsies _still_ think that asking 'Why bother?' is a bright question."

Archer nods. "Fair dinkum, boss. Trouble with newsies is, they spend so bloody much time learning _how_ to tell a story, they don't learn anything about what stories they _should_ be telling. Useless gits, the lot of 'em."

"Yeah well that newsy's going ta get what's coming to him soon enough. You'll see." That grin on Oi's face has gone rather thoughtful by now. "It might be a while in the coming, but you'll see... that's besides the point for now. So erm, I'm ready to go. Been ready. Can't wait to feel the open sky against my face again. I'll bet we can even smell Domwun from out there."

Leandra looks ahead for a few more moments, then turns to MacArther, considering him carefully. Her voice is clear and smooth as she says, "I think it is always a fair question, however. It is when we stop asking 'why?' that we begin to make serious mistakes."

Archer chuckles. "You'd best not be tryin' to, though. You stick your nose into unprocessed atmosphere, you won't be smelling anything much after a couple minutes."

For his part, Jiro stays quiet. He does smile, while listening to his soon-to-be shipmates banter.

MacArthur's two aids stand, both middle-aged men, one tall, skinny and blonde, the other with dark skin and knotty hair reminiscent of a true Aboriginal tribe, remarkable in an age of racial homogeneity. The tall man rubs his forehead. "For all the effort they put in, we could just issue a statement."

Archer twitches a pale eyebrow at Oi. "You really want to get back at him? Wait til his story's going to be published and substitute a glowing recommendation for the project instead of whatever Luddite hack job he puts in. Upset his readers, maybe make a few of 'em think."

"You bloody well know what I mean," quips Oi. "Besides, they say Domwun transcends all vacuums. It's a sight to see, really. And one to smell. Just watch out for the Tox-vines." Oi nods towards Leandra, "You're right. But he wasn't asking 'why'. He was asking the same stupid thing they always ask."

Oi glances at Archer, "You know, that's a nice idea. You'll get the hang of this Game just yet you will."

The Aboriginal, incongruously named Jackson, narrows his eyes at Oi. "You know the trouble we had to go through to get the city to let you out of the lock-up. Take it easy with the poor fellow or they'll be sticking you back in a hole with nothing but a console and eight miles of buggy program code."

Leandra looks towards the tall aid and considers for a moment. She says nothing in the end, however. She draws back into her own thoughts, her distraction made clear when she starts to fuss with her blouse again. This time the sleeves are pushed about uselessly with her hands.

Jiro finally speaks. "They'll judge the mission by results, not press conferences," he says. "That means no interfering with reporters, whatever your personal feelings. That means we each give our all."

Oi sighs. "Yeah. I suppose you're right. And I always give my all. Wouldn't be worth my weight in gold if I didn't."

Archer snorts. "Who's they? The citizens, yes, you're right - if the newsies even _give_ 'em the story. The newsies themselves? Beyond hope, most of 'em."

MacArthur smiles slowly at Jiro's comment, but says nothing for the moment.

Jiro chuckles softly. "If enough people thought enough other people were beyond hope, Archer, we wouldn't be here."

Archer just shrugs in response. He's not at all convinced of the innate goodness of humans.

Oi smiles at Jiro, "You know, that's a good point. Besides, newsies serve their purpose too Archer. It's just a matter of sparking their interest. Not too worried about 'em though. We'll get what needs to be done, done."

The tall blond man, Hoyt Anders (judging by his nametag), slides a small plastic case containing a computer chip across the table to MacArthur. "The latest data on the processor renovations at Coulam. My team's been in there for months. Pull this off and you'll cut our time in half. I have to get back into it. Gentlemen. Lady." He gives the barest of bows and exits the room, followed by Jackson, leaving you alone with MacArthur.

Archer smiles. "That we will. So - back to the mission countdown. Enough time wasted trying to convince reporters that an interstellar colony has a use for space travel."

"Right," MacArthur says. "That part I'm leaving to you. You've got the authority to set the agenda and requisition what you need. As to the 'countdown', we've no set deadline, but I'd appreciate it if you could get preliminary recon done before Anders tries to light up his blower in two weeks. Otherwise they'll be trying to get antimatter out of me and we need that for shuttle fuel... which will delay our launch date for Aurora..." He pauses. "You know the story already, I suppose."

Leandra notices her hand again meddling with her blouse and decides the only way to keep herself from wasting her energy is to clasp her hands together. She is still listening to MacArthur, of course, and she she tries to focus on him and take her mind away from distractions.

He looks at each of the Aurora crew in turn. "I know you can do it. And I know why we have to. So do most people, I guess, when they think about it. But after a century out in the dark, most of them don't remember, and many don't care to think too hard about it." He stands to leave.

"Right right. No worries mate, we'll have it done for you by the time that blower gets lit up." Oi keeps that grin worn. "So then my friends, shall we do this?" He peers at the data, then at Leandra, "And are you going to say anything?"

Archer nods. "I think we've got most of what we need already. We can head out tomorrow afternoon or the next morning if the gear for the restart is ready."

Leandra turns to face Oi for a moment, and with her more usual grace, shakes her head just slightly in answer.

Oi chuckles, "I suppose not then. Any plans for non-verbal communication beyond your gestures?"

Leandra shrugs at Oi. "I'm sure something will come to me," she finally says.

MacArthur snorts. "Leave off her, Oi Vey." He looks over at Leandra. "You can skip the next briefing, if you'd prefer. Not like they ask questions we haven't already answered a dozen times."

Oi says, "Well I'll be..."

MacArthur stands, picks up his pad, and walks out of the room by the double-doors at the front. The lock clicks open as he approaches, and the doors hang open as he passes.

Oi accesses a recon sattelite using his visor rig, and displays the results on the holographic display on the wall. The power station at Icereach is barely visible in the photo as a muddled infrared signature. He superimposes a bright green outline over the site, based on blueprints from before the Crash.

Icereach is located in the foothills of a long mountain range, thrust up by colliding tectonic plates. Most of the installation is dug into the side of a large hill; only a few buildings, scattered around a broad square landing field, are visible outside.

"Well there's something there." Oi nods, carefully. "Wonder what else we can find? Hmmm. Doesn't look like there's much in the way of critters out there. Can't help to be prepared for them... but y'know, this stuff reminds me of one of the dome power sources. Radiates ambient energy..."

Archer says, "Hmm. You think it might still be on idle after all this time?"

Oi continues, overlaying a weather forecast. Winter at those latitudes is brutal; storms may dump several feet of snow. However, the forecast is clear for the next four days.

Archer nods at the weather forecast. "Looks good. That's a long spell of stable weather for this time of year that far up. Shall we push the departure up to tomorrow morning, then? Right after breakfast?"

Jiro nods, considering. "It's the right psychological time as well. We've said what we're going to do, so we'll get right on doing it."

Leandra considers the information carefully. What she learns, she stores away, to consider with due care. "This location could be reactivated with some ingenuity and the right drilling equipment," she finally says. "The weather, if we are lucky, will cooperate, but in that area predictions often go astray. At most, I would trust the best estimates only to reveal the outcome of the next 48 hours."

Oi says, "So we'd best get crackin' then. I suppose if we brought along sufficient repair equipment, maybe drills, is it? Well I'll be ready to head out after breakfast."

Archer nods. "Sounds about right. It's more chaotic in the polar latitudes than down here at the equator. A four day forecast up there is about as accurate as a four-week one down here."

Team Aurora leaves the auditorium and files into the lobby of the administrative building of the Space Authority of Ayer. The building is located inside its own dome, and so the lobby is 'outside'; the arc of the dome stretches overhead. It is mid-day and the sky is a shining azure blue. The paraquartz panels overhead are practically transparent, and apart from the lack of wind, it's nearly impossible to tell that you're still indoors.

A single receptionist is seated at a broad, ring-like desk near the entrance to the tunnel that connects the Space Agency building with the main dome of Domwun. She nods as you pass. The heavy doors of the connecting tunnel slide open with a quiet whirr as you approach. The tunnel isn't transparent, like the dome, and flourescent tubes light the way as you pass.

At the far end of the tunnel, a similar pair of doors slide open and admit you into the city of Domwun. The cieling here is much higher, and the air more pungent, but not unpleasantly so - more of a tang of machinery, than an odor. The doors open into a small parking lot, with a small collection of ground vehicles. The buildings inside the dome crowd close on either side, and a broad avenue leads away across the center of the city, towards a green swath of the Ayer central park.

"Ahhh. Smell that? Domwun. At it's finest. Well... not quite it's finest but..." Oi is quite pleased to be out of lock-down, and back in the open air. So to speak. "Well I'll see you lot tomorrow morning. Bright and early. Just got to go get packed."

The cars drive you to your quarters, slipping quietly through the streets on electic motors, guided by the city's computers. Each of you spends the evening preparing for the following day. In the morning, you take similar vehicles and assemble at the Domwun airfield.

Jiro is wearing his uniform, as usual. He's also got on a pair of vid-glasses, and even now he's collating, analyzing, and synthesizing data on the remote station. He takes a break from his work to greet his fellow shipmates, with a heady smile.

The airport building is several stories high, and built into the wall of the dome. The area inside the dome is filled with offices and classrooms; the section outside the dome is a large hanagar. A variety of small craft in different states of repair sit on the floor of the hangar. A small army of technicians is milling around, checking the craft. Occasionaly, the giant airlock at the north end of the room will open, and a flier will be pulled in or out of the vault-like room with a tug.

Oi is wearing a uniform as well. He nods over the tops of his glasses, pushes them up along his nose, and smiles. "Good morning everyone. We ready to go then?"

Archer is dressed in something different than his usual ship-suit today, warm trousers and a heavy shirt, and is carrying a parka and gloves. He also has an archaic slug-pistol in a shoulder holster concealed under the shirt when he arrives, though he shifts it to outside the shirt once he's away from the city.

Leandra arrives in a rather different uniform. One that might explain why the blouse was such an irritation to her. The cut is far from military, leaving both arms and shoulders bare. She is studying her surroundings slowly. When Oi speaks up that same, slow consideration her eyes give everything drifts to him. "I believe it could be said that we are prepared as we can be," she replies. Her supplies wait near her, already thoroughly inspected.

Archer says, "Fair dinkum, Miss. Might even be true. Let's load her up and be on our way, shall we?"

The team's small collection of high-tech equipment sits in front of them on the floor of the hanger. A technician rolls up with an electric tug and loads it onto a pallet, then drives the tug over to a VTOL. The craft is simple and durable, a common design on Ayer, looking like nothing so much as a large cube van with rotating thrust nacelles across a spar on its roof. Like most vehicles in the hanger, it sits on a skid, the edges striped yellow and black, so it can be easily dragged out into the landing field on a tug.

The technician opens the rear hatch and hoists items from the pallete into the craft. He finishes as you approach. "G'day. Yer fuelled an' ready to fly. If you want to get aboard now, we'll tow you outside and ye can save yerself from breathin' the air... not so good today. I hear the processor's down for tests and there's an awful lotta nitrogen floatin' around this mornin'.

Jiro nods. "We should get aboard anyway. We'll want to double-check our breathing gear."

Archer grins. "Which means not enough oxy, then. Nothin' wrong with nitrogen. It's the monoxide that'll kill ya."

The technician nods. "That it will. You want to do yer own walk-around, sir? We're due to get you out on the field in fifteen, so there's time if you like."

Leandra remains quiet through this, observing the others and listening. She clasps her hands behind her back, waiting for the decision to be made to board the ship.

Archer grins, and is already starting his check-out. No good pilot ever trusts someone else to do that check.

Jiro leads the way, crawling into the waiting craft. He carries a basic reducing respirator, but his combat armor is what he'll be wearing, and it is this that receives the most attention. His weapons, too, are carefully checked and re-checked.

The technician's eyes linger a moment on Leandra as she passes. After a moment, he looks away and busies himself with the control panel on the tug.

Oi boards the ship, "Nice. Nice indeed. Boy, do you know how good it feels to actually be up and away, such as it is..." There's no hiding the grin. He'll busy himself on the trip over and check his toys, although every now and again he'll mumble something about lines of code.

Leandra pays little heed to the look from the technician. It's become so common, after all. She occasionally pretends that they are only staring because they find her attractive. Right now she doesn't entertain any fantasies. She is checking her sensor equipment and making certain that she has all that she needs. She checks things in such a methodical way one might think she's done this before, disassembling her pack and then repacking it perfectly in just a few minutes.

Archer finishes the walk-around and retrieves his winter gear. "Looks fine. Let's load up and be ready to move out, folks." He climbs on board, singing something about riders and storms under his breath.

The technician drives the tug to the front of the VTOL and there's a loud clunk as the coupling engages. Within a few minutes you're inside the airlock. The technicial leaves the tug and ducks back inside. There's a hissing of air as the airlock cycles, and the outer doors slide open. The tug moves on its own along taxiways. You pass several unpressurized hangars, as big as the one you were in, where technicians labor on other craft, wearing respirator masks and heavy boots.

Finally, the tug stops disengages on a square, paved blast pad, and the tower gives Archer clearance to launch. The engines spool up to several tens of thousands of RPM - the must be making a hell of a racket outside, but the VTOL is well made, and you can't hear much inside.

Archer finishes up the pre-lift power check and keys the mike. "November 7 taking off, tower. Seeya on the flip side."

The sides of the VTOL has several broad, rectangular portals, that turn transparent as Archer takes you airborne. The engines rotate to direct most of their thrust straight down, and the block craft rises from the pad and rapidly climes first to a few hundred, then to a few thousand feet. The city of Domwun stretches out below you, like hills of glass. From this side, sunlight flints off the paraquartz panels in the clear morning air.

Stretching away from the east of the dome, you can see several railroad lines. Trains, maybe a dozen cars long, move in both directions. Further to the east, several miles you'd guess, you can see the bulk of the atmosophere processor. Easily twice as tall as any of the domes, the processor comes to a truncated peak, reminding you of a volcano. Indeed, the air shimmers near the top of the tower - millions of tons of gas pass through it every day, creating hundred-knot winds and distortions in the air.

"Beautiful, isn't it," observes Jiro in a soft voice, glancing out the 'portholes' as he adjusts the utility webbing that his gear attaches to. "The natural world can be shaped by man's technology, but it will never truly bow to man's wishes. A world that forces discipline and responsibility on us.. I sometimes wonder about the rightness of atmosphere processing."

As if to give emphasis to Jiro's words, there's a jolt as Archer shifts into horizontal flight, catching a hot air current blowing away from the giant terraforming factory.

Archer says, "It's either that or genetically engineering us to breathe that smog. I'd rather fix the atmosphere, personally. And .... here we go."

Leandra looks to Jiro and allows herself a small smile. "I believe it is the duty of those who can to spread the beauty of life to all corners of the world," she suggests calmly. "And for now, we must settle on changing the world, though it is still my hope that we might change ourselves instead to live in harmony with any place."

"Hey now... I've just about reprogrammed half of that thing. By hand no less. None of this easy stuff about interface terminals, had to go in and fiddle with the wires." Oi has a note of pride in his voice regarding work he'd done. "The smog is just part of the stench that makes up Domwun. Wouldn't be the same without it you know. But that's besides the point..." He looks over at Leandra, "We're gonna be passing Coulam soon... is it true what they say? Do they really go around nekkid all the time in their own lands?"

Archer says, "If you're planning to tap into their surveillance cameras to find out, Oi, forget it. You're not clogging my comm bandwidth to play voyeur."

Leandra actually laughs softly, "That rumor still persists, does it? Well, perhaps we shall see. I fear you will see little, however. Coulam know that those who dwell outside find nudity very distracting, and so we do not wish to cause them such trouble." She does not maintain the mystery for long, however, as she goes on, "We do not often follow that old tradition. Some houses still do so, but only privately, and of course any of our more serious ceremonies require it. In general, we go with very light clothing. It is simply far more comfortable."

Miles of empty territory slide by beneath you. For the first half-hour there are settlements visible, mostly near rivers or lakes, none larger than a few domes. Many are surrounded by broad, green fields of crops - the atmosphere on Domwun may be terrible for humans, but a lot of plants thrive in the nitrogen-rich environment.

Oi chuckles. "Ah well. Another rumour shot down." He nods at Archer, "Believe me, I wouldn't stoop to something as amateurish as using comm bandwidth to tap into their cameras... you wouldn't even notice." He grins, "Not that there's much reason to do it no-wow... would you look at that! Green! Real honest to goodness nature-y green!"

"Nature is a better topic of conversation than au naturel, Oi," remarks Jiro with a grunt, as he glances up from his computing and equipping for a moment.

You pass over a settlement three hundred miles from Domwun, a single dome next to a small lake, and then there's no further sign of habitation. The engines rumble quietly, and the navigation computer indicates you've got three hours of flight until you overfly Coulam, and a further hour to Icereach.

Oi says, "I'll bet you they've got a buncha legumes growing out there... they pull the nitrogen right out of the air you know. Dump it in the soil. Nice and spiny though, some are."

Leandra shakes her head, sighing softly. "The cities truly leave your world grey, with concrete and synthetic materials" she comments. "When we return, perhaps I can show you my home, so you can grow familiar with the concept of natural color." Though as to whether she means of plants or flesh tones is unclear.

Archer has been watching the fuel gauges all through the journey. "We will need to top off at Coulam either on the way out or on the way in. We don't carry enough for the round trip. I'd prefer to refuel on the way up."

The stop at Coulam is brief; the team leaves the the VTOL only long enough for a Coulamite crew to roll out a tanker and refuel. To Oi's disappointment, the crew is rather heavily clothed. The air has grown considerably cooler in the four hours you've been aloft.

Less than half an hour later, Team Aurora is airborn again, with sufficient fuel to make the trip to Icereach and back twice. The terrain below changes drastically over the one hour flight. Coulam, while at a high latitude, is still coastal, and is warmed by ocean breezes.

Icereach, on the other hand, is in rougher, more moutainous territory. After passing Coulam's dormant atmosphere processor, the ground rises quickly, and Archer increases altitude to avoid the obstacles. A row of high-tension power lines stretches from the processor across the tops of the hills, miraculously intact after a century of neglect, and eventually leads you to a deserted and desolate valley that can only be Icereach.

The slopes of the valley are covered in swaths of pine trees, or some engineered variant planted long ago. Some tower a hundred feet high, concealing parts of the valley. Archer does a slow circle and spots a flat area in the middle of the landing field, the same field that was visible on the sattelite photo, The VTOL slows to a halt and makes the last two hundred feet of your trip in a slow vertical drop.

The VTOL bumps to a halt in the middle of the field, the few buildings visible as mounds of windswept snow a few hundred feet away. Archer shuts down the engines, and all is silent, save for the wind whipping over the hull.
