# Synthetic Saints 2004-03-04

Icereach is located in the bottom of a broad valley. To the east, a mountain range rises sharply into the air, with reddish, jagged peaks. Foothills, sparsely covered in some kind of engineered confier tree, stretch away to the west, obscuring your view of the horizon. The valley runs north to south. A shallow river trickles along the floor of the valley, burbling in the late winter air. Patches of snow are still visible on the ground, with some hardy mountain grasses peeking through into the cold, clear air.

The Icereach landing field is a broad, level apron of concrete. The painted-on markings have faded from a century of neglect, and grass grows up between the seams in the pavement. Empty shipping crates are scattered across the apron. Three lonely-looking quonset huts, maybe eight meters high at their peak, are to the south. What you assume are the generators are to the north, inside a fenced-in enclosure with a corrugated metal roof. There appear to be six generators, in two rows of three. The drumlike machines are six meters high and surrounded by a maze of pipes, regulators, and cabling. A trio of high-tension power transmission lines stretch west from the generators, and then turn south to follow the river towards Coulam.

Archer says, "Looks calm enough. Let's see... is there a hangar here?"

A hundred meters to the east, at the foot of the mountains, sits a square, low concrete building with narrow windows. The pipes lead in thick bundles from the generator plant into the north wall of the building. There is a large blast door, eight meters across, in the west face of the building.

The team sits inside the VTOL, which has set down in the middle of the landing field. All is quiet, except for the wind whistling over the hull of the aircraft.

Archer is looking out at the compound. "Hmm. I don't see anything that looks like a hangar. Maybe one of the Quonset huts is a storage unit. I'd hate to depend on the weather reports to keep our ride home intact." He goes to get his oxygen mask and checks his pistol. "First things first. Find a place to stash the ship and then check out the generators."

Jiro taps into the craft's own avionics, tying them to his vidglasses, and manipulating data with his hands in the air for a few moments. "I'll go ahead," he suggests. "If you get the all-clear from me, bring the craft inside."

Donning his infantry armor, and attaching ammo and sensors to his combat webbing, Jiro treads toward the airlock, cycles himself through, and heads out onto the 'crete. He moves warily, scanning visually and with his sonic-motion detectors.

Leandra looks outside for a time and then turns to get herself properly dressed. After all, she can't go traipsing outside in her 'flight suit'. A small shiver runs through her. She doesn't like being cold.

"Alright. So uh, alright. We'll just wait on the all-clear then." Oi nods, slowly, and has eyebrows raised when Jiro pops out of the airlock. "Bonkers... now that's just... actually looks pretty fun..." mutters Oi.

Jiro crosses the pad, sometimes crouching behind abandoned crates, sometimes darting across open areas where there is no cover. The sensors are quiet, and the buildings are cold. He comes up beside the last quonset hut in the row and crouches between an empty storage crate and the west wall. Leaning around the corner, he sees the sliding front doors of the shed are slightly ajar.

Through his helmet's sensors, data is relayed to the VTOL and its occupants. At least somewhat confidently, Jiro creeps toward the front doors, weapon at the ready.

Archer watches all this through the cockpit glass, slightly bemused. "And people say _I'm_ paranoid..."

Jiro's vision goggles compensate for the difference in lighting between inside and out. The doors stand about a meter apart. The buidling contains a number of crates, many obviously empty, some appearing to be unopened. A large drum, probably a fuel tank of several thousand liters, stands against the back wall.

"Caution is wise," says Leandra. She slips her multi-view goggles around her neck, but does not pull them up over her eyes yet. "In places like this, life always dangles on a thin thread." She checks herself and then nods. She waits for the okay now, her mask in hand.

"Alright then. I suppose caution in the case of thin dangly threads would be the right sort of thing. Especially in the case where the thin dangly threads are attached to your life!" Oi gives a smile, braces himself for the landing, "Don't suppose you'd have any more advice besides... 'be careful' do you?"

Leandra hmms at Oi. "I do have a lot of advice," she answers. "But we really haven't the time for proper instruction here." She looks outside and waits to step out into the chilly air.

Archer fires up the engines again and lifts gently upward by just a few feet, drifting slowly toward the building that Jiro thinks will make a good hangar. He sets the ship down just outside the doors and powers down. "Now we push her inside. Can't risk leaving her outside in this climate, a wind shift could wreck her."

In the interim, Jiro keep the other door covered. He trusts his shipmates to watch the now-open forward doors.

"Right, well then..." Oi blinks a few times as the shift takes off. "So do we have any other information around here? Anything interesting showing up on scanners or the like?"

The team steps out of the airlock on the VTOL one at a time. Archer slides the door open, and then goes to join Leandra and Oi to push the heavy aircraft inside, shoving debris or crushing it underfoot. It moves slowly on rollers, but soon enough, it is inside the hut. The doors are closed and all is quiet again.

Archer says, "There. All safe and sound. What's next on the agenda? Check the control room?"

Leandra is glad of the warmth. At least in comparison to what she expects later. "Well, we should go and see why this place isn't working," says Leandra. She's going to make a casual survey. "I think it'd be wise to start by inspecting the control systems. They are likely to be the source of the problem or at least to give us a hint about the reason things have failed."

Archer shrugs. "Nothing has failed, really... it's just been left alone since the Crash."

"Yeah..." says Oi, looking around. He's mostly talking to himself. "I could probably seal this place up. If I had more time and equipment and stuff. Although you know, I think... yeah a remote alarm of some kind." And so Oi goes about doing just that.

Oi removes some remote sensors from his toolkit, and wires the front and back doors. A small icon appears on his visor indicating that the four of you are inside the makeshift hangar. In the event your VTOL is disturbed, Oi will get advance warning.

"Not so," says Leandra. "The computer controls are disabled and we have to ascertain what happened to the four generators that were not operating at the time of the crash. What we do know is that those twelve who fled this area went to Coulam."

Archer says, "Did they stay there, or continue south?"

"They did not stay long in Coulam," says Leandra. "They probably wound up in Domwun. I don't think we'll have to walk their path. We're here to fix what they left behind. At least, that is my hope. I would like to see more respect given our greater task, and only success can bring that to be. Those media people are very strange, however. Curious creatures."

Archer grins at that. "That's always been my assessment, too, Leandra. Chatterboxes, the lot of 'em."

The generators are enclosed on the south, east, and west sides by high chain-link fence, set directly into the concrete pad. The north wall is made of poured concrete. A thick roof of corrugated plastic covers the enclosure. Several man-sized gates lead inside, and are chained shut.

Jiro leads the team across the apron towards the generators, crouching low and hiding behind debris. It takes several minutes at this pace and the team becomes intimately familiar with the feel of the concrete pad.

"So why the bloody devil are we still yakkin' on about those media guys? When it seems like we SHOULD be off fixing these generators. I swear. Give me ten minutes and a spanner and I'll have 'em fixed faster than you can count to twenty billion." Oi taps on his glasses, then smiles, "Alright. Got the alarms linked to my glasses. I'll have warning if stuff is disturbed."

Jiro circles the shed, leaving the team at the southwest corner. After a few minutes he returns, having encountered nothing but short climb over the cold ceramic pipes at the east end, where the steam lines enter the shed.

Leandra tilts her head, studying Oi as they are lead on this stealthy adventure. She's not precisely well equipped for it, though she tries to not ruin the effect. She is more than happy to wait for Jiro to finish the circuit on his own.

Returning, Jiro peers at the lock and chain for a moment. "We don't have time for this," he remarks. Less than a second is required for his katana to clear its scabbard, and the impossibly sharp blade slides through the chain. It takes longer for the blade to return to its resting place than it did to cut.

Leandra winces as the chain is cut. She sighs softly and moves forward, drawing the chain free and taking the lock, as well. She opens up her equipment bag and sets the items inside with something akin to reverance.

"So what it boils down to is reprogramming the computers, making sure that all the bits still work, check on the geotherms, and... lube 'em up real good." Oi nods, "At least that's what we should put in our report." He grins. "Maybe give it to that reporter to read on live TV.

After Jiro's subtle and stylish method of lockpicking, the gates of the generator shed hang open. Oi scrambles over the equipment, plugging his computer into long-dormant monitoring gear to check up on the state of the machines. The shed is every bit as deserted as the rest of the station, save that it lacks the persistent debris of the landing field underfoot.

Archer and Oi continue to inspect the generator farm, while Jiro and Leandra go south to check out the remaining two huts. The middle building is nearly as empty as the first, but has a few full crates. The shipping manifests indicate that they contain generator parts, machine tools, and electronic components; a few contain preserved food.

Jiro inventories what he sees, transmitting via radio-link to Oi's rig. "Let me know if any of this will be useful," he adds.

The final hut contains no crates, but it does contain an intact VTOL aircraft, similar to your own. It is covered in dust and doesn't look like it's been moved in a century. The control pad near the pilot's door is dark and totally unresponsive, and the doors are locked shut.

"I think we may have just what we need after all," says Leandra. "It may be vanity, but I would really prefer if we could make these generators functional again on our own. Maybe then people would start paying attention to our real duties."

"Hey that food might still be good, actually. Er. I mean we'll probably want to use some of those machine tools and generator parts. If you can bring 'em around over here that is." Oi tilts his head, "I still say we need some good ol' grease. Maybe the preserved food is some kind of fast food..."

Jiro nods slowly. "One more thing we found," he transmits after discovering the VTOL. "Archer, are you occupied? If so, would you come over and check this out?" Along with his transmission is a visual of the sister-ship.

Archer looks around, wondering what it is that's trying to get his attention. He heads over to where Jiro is. "They left a VTOL behind? I wonder why?"

"This must be the ship that was disabled during the crash," says Leandra. "If so, it may prove useful in understanding what happened here."

Archer says, "Just don't try to tap into its computers. If the Crash really was a computer virus, we don't want it getting loose again."

Jiro nods. "Beyond that, if something happens to our ship, this one may be of use. See what you can do?"

"Hey guys, if you can get me in... these generators'll be up and running again no problem. All I need is access. It'll have us powered at LEAST long enough to get more supplies out this way." Oi sounds quite pleased with himself.

Archer says, "I'll take a look. These aren't the easiest things to handle without computer assistance, though. Most folks have a tendency to set up positive feedback loops overcorrecting wobbles."

"That would be perfect, Oi," says Leandra, sounding quite impressed. And here she was afraid that people outside Coulam would set her up with misfits. "Do you know if the drills are alright? I know they had some amazing materials, but it has been a fair amount of time."

Archer says, "Oh, by the way, Oi... something's odd about that corner over there, where the steam lines go through the fence. You might want to check it out more carefully. Just a hunch, but..."

"Would technical manuals be useful, Archer?" asks Jiro. "We can call back and see if there's anything on file for this craft."

"Okay... sure thing..." Oi draws his needler, turns to look at the odd corner he's been directed to look at. He creeps towards it, hoping Archer meant something odd mechanically, not something living...

Archer says, "Hmm. The computer's FUBAR. I wouldn't even want to try flying the thing without it. It might or might not be compatible with ours - I suppose Oi could get the specs transmitted from Domwun, though. But don't try crossconnecting it to ours, it might blow -both- computers."

Jiro transmits a request to Oi's rig, asking for it to send what he sees. He waits carefully, still accompanying Leandra but ready to rush out in case of trouble.

Jiro frowns. "I'll be back shortly," he says, sprinting off toward Oi's position.

Leandra and Archer stand alone in the eastern warehouse. Archer prods the control pad. Even with a spare battery, the display panel just displays static. Leandra considers what she knows about the drilling operations.

"Hullo... what's this wire?" Oi isn't stupid enough to actually go and touch the thing, but he'll definitely point it out to the others via the vidlink. "See this? Anyone know what it is?"

In the video from his visor, it's apparent that Oi is pointing at a wire running along the length of one of the steam pipes. It is a few millimeters across, and stops just short of the fence. It seems to run the length of the pipe, maybe even as far as the blockhouse.

Archer stares at the vidlink. "I don't know what that wire is, but ... it's important, somehow. Can you trace it? Where is it hooked up to?"

"It's wow... this is really advanced tech here. A high-temperature superconductor, maybe. Freakish alloy, rare. Bloody rare." Oi sounds rather impressed with this little bit of wire.

Jiro jogs across the 'crete and catches up with Oi, staring up at the wire as well. "We can probably trace it, Archer. You two, be careful over there and keep in touch. Oi, let's go."

"Socolite," says Leandra. "That is a curious thing to have here. I wonder what they needed it for." She will wait around, dimly wondering what exactly they are hiding from. Still, better to be safe than deceased.

Jiro closely follows Oi, keeping his rifle handy as the technician follows the thin wire along the top of the steam pipe. The thick bundle of conuits runs a hundred meters or more from the generator plant before making a right turn and running smack into the north wall of the blockhouse. The wire is present the entire length of the pipe. It seems to become thicker as you follow it, turning into a flat ribbon that seems bonded to the ceramic surface of the conduit. The ribbon and the pipes disappear through the wall and into the large building.

"This is very strange," says Leandra. "No mention of solocite was given in any of the reports we were given. Does it look like it is a recent addition? I don't think it should be here."

"A live wire.. low current through a super conductor," murmurs Leandra, almost to herself. "Could it be that someone is working on fixing this place and then stealing the power through that wire? Perhaps Jiro's caution is very well-founded."

"Huh." Oi blinks, "Hey wait up a sec here..." He then utters the Famous Last Words, "That's funny."

"You know, Jiro, I'm thinking," Oi says, indicating the wire to his shipmate. "I'm thinking that something this fancy and high-tech all the way out here... you know, I can't help but think it's like a generator all itself. This thing might be a kind of generator. Maybe. I could be wrong... but huh.."

Jiro shrugs. "Okay, then. So, what, the wire produces power itself? Sounds unlikely."

There is an airlock door, sealed and silent, next to the bundle of conduits. Oi takes several items from his toolkit and within a few minutes has a backup power cell attached to the door. He overrides the control system and Jiro hears the thick bolts draw back into the frame with a soft 'thud'.

"I'm thinking it might somehow be tied into one of these doodads to make it's own power, yes. At this place? The way it just sort of fits, but isn't an obvious part of the plan... yeah... it could easily be a generator... but the question is... who put it here?" Oi has his weapon out at the ready, held cautiously as he advances. "We might be finding out you know."

The inside of this building is a mixture of darkness and light. Sunlight streams in from the high windows in the west wall, and paraquartz skylights in the roof. Dust covers everything and dust motes dance in the slanting sunbeams. To the east, a broad, high tunnel, four meters high and six wide, drives straight into the side of the mountain. Four wheeled objects the size and shape of semi trailers stand at the south end of the building. The mass of steam pipes enters the building through the north wall and crosses the floor, following the tunnel into the interior of the mountain. Spartan steel stairways lead up the side of the airlock, which protrudes several meters into the building. A booth with transparent walls covers the top of the airlock, apparently some kind of control room. It is filled with consoles and displays, all dark and silent.

Jiro points toward the control room. "Let's go in. I'll keep you covered."

Oi quickly locates the superconducting ribbon on this side of the airlock. It's still bound do the top of a steam pipe and continues on into the darkness.

"Alright. Just you keep me covered then eh?" Oi steps forwards, silently as he can. He follows the path of the superconductor with his eyes, though every now and again he'll spare a wary glance to either side. He then steps towards the control booth, drawing a deep breath.

Oi darts up the stairwell and into the control booth. Jiro crouches in the darkness by the airlock door, the sensors on his rifle sweeping the cavernous room... detecting no movement.

Archer is watching over the vidlinks. "Should I join you, or stay here with the ship?"

"Stay with the ship," replies Jiro, quietly. "If you can do anything with those computers, it will be invaluable."

Archer says, "Roger, wilco. Don't hold your breath, though. The programs are shot to hell and gone, and I can't rewrite them myself."

Oi notes that the superconductor is bound to the steampipe, and that the steampipe veers off to the tunnel in the back of the room. The control booth is relatively well-lit by the skylights and the windows. A thin layer of dust covers everything. A dozen consoles and a few office chairs are here. All the consoles are offline and powered down.

"So yeah everything's powered down in here..." Oi whispers to the others over the link, "But I think I could probably turn 'em back on. Shall I give 'er a go?"

Jiro hmms. "Go ahead and do what you can," he says.

Oi gets to work on the computers, attaching his spare energy cell to the power lines of the mainframe. The machines sputter to life and the displays are instantly filled with static... but Oi Vey has brought computers back from the death of the Crash before, and these prove to be no serious challenge. Within a few minutes he has repair programs, decrypters, and expert systems rebuilding their cores, and sits quitely tapping away at keypads and consoles.

Jiro, meanwhile, inspects the smaller structures. They appear to be temporary buildings erected inside the blockhouse, the size and shape of cargo trailers. The door opens at a simple push. Inside the first is a lounge, with couches, vidscreens, and a galley of sorts.

The others are bunkhouses - mobile coffine hotels. Each has eight cubes big enough to sleep or recline in, stacked two high and two wide, with a narrow aisle down the middle. A shower and recycling toilet is in a room at the far end.

Some of the food in the galley is still good, but it is all emergency ration bars in foil wrappers, with manufacturing dates of well over a hundred years ago. A pile of dust rests at the bottom of the refrigerator, which might have once been the putrid remains of fresh foods.

The showers and toilets are also covered in dust. You could believe nobody has trod this way in a century. Jiro also chekcs the sleeping cubes... and stops short. In one trailer, six of the cubes appear to have been used, and still have sheets, blankets, and clothes in them. In the other... seven cubes appear to have been used. One still has a parka hanging from a peg on the wall.

"Hah!" Oi allows himself a small exclamation of victory. "Crash or no crash... I'm still the best... it's all a matter of doing the Math. Lemme know if you need anything, I'll be here a while."

"I'm on my way," is all Leandra says. She is watching Jiro, and sees the shut cubes. She knows it is probably absurd, that they have to be coffins quite literally, but she wants to see for herself, and see quickly. She's not much for stealth, so she's just going to rush down the same path that Jiro and Oi used.

Jiro peers at the nametag on the parka. He reaches into the air, programming a query for information into Ayer's historical archives. Perhaps the name's relevance can be discovered? This transmitted through the network back home, Jiro returns to the control booth.

"We have a name - 'Halunen' - and we'll find out what we can," reports Jiro, as he sees Leandra. "I'm glad you're here, Leandra. Does your medical knowledge include forensics?"

Oi searches the computer cores of the power plant. It's badly corrupted - possibly the worst result of the Crash that Oi has ever seen, even worse than the mess in the atmosphere processors. The memory contains the smashed fragments of a million programs and pieces of programs in no discernable order. A small piece of the original data files are recoverable, including a general plan of the building and some telecommunications records.

Archer turns as Leandra runs off, and starts to follow - but then he realizes that she's heading straight for the others, so he goes back to trying to do a preflight check on the ancient VTOL.

"Ahhh my pretties. Poor poor fragmented programs. Well, Oi'll have you working fine in no time... but let's see what's what..." Oi will then open what small pieces of data files are recoverable, before checking for the name Halunen.

"I'm afraid not," answers Leandra, sighing softly. She studies the room closely, not moving further inside. "I see little of use here," she adds quietly.

There is no mention of superconducters in the general plan of the building. The map shows that the cavern beyond is about the same size as the blockhouse, and has a machine shop, and some of the pumping machinery for the steamworks. There is a shaft, ten meters in diameter, drilled down to some caverns two hundred meters down, where a second set of pumping machinery drives water down the final bore into the magma bed, and channels the resulting steam up the shaft.

An elevator and a thick set of control cables are also depicted. The circuits connected to the control cables show that any sensor readings on the status of the steamworks dead-end at the bottom of the shaft - it might be collapsed.

Jiro frowns. "Alright. Archer, stay put, call if you need us. Oi, you're best where you are. I'll act as your eyes and ears, tell me where to go next. Leandra, see what you can remember or dig up on Coulam's archives from the survivors' arrival, if any such thing is available."

Finally, Oi sees that there were once programs in place to control remotely piloted drones - maintainence robots - but despite repeated attempts to locate them, their beacons cannot be found.

Jiro stalks across the floor of the blockhouse and back to the bundle of steam lines. The superconducting ribbon is still there, and follows the steam line as it goes towards the tunnel. The tunnel floor is covered in an open grating, and the steam lines sink under the floor here. The mysterious wire is still visible as Jiro creeps down the tunnel. Ten meters later it opens out into a cavern, as large as the blockhouse and several meters taller. It is unlit, but Jiro's sensors pick out rough outlines of equipment - a small mountain of pumping machinery on the back wall, next to the drill shaft.

To the north, Jiro detects a wall, obviously man-made, that seperates part of the cavern from the rest. It's probably the machine shop Oi mentioned... otherwise, it's dark in here.

Archer decides to try rebooting the old VTOL with a copy of the protocols from the one they arrived in. He's careful not to connect the systems, and brings the core programs over on a chip. "Let's see if you can read these..."

Meanwhile, Archer has managed to get the VTOL into recovery mode. The computers are coming back on-line. The fuel tanks are empty and everything is running on bare reserves of power... but it seems the aircraft might be operational again, if it can be fuelled.

Leandra discovers the depositions of the survivors of Icereach in Coulam's archives. The statements are brief. There is mention of 'Galil Halunen' being a casualty. Against saftey regulations, he was working alone on the pumping equipment at the bottom of the shaft. There was an explosion and he was buried. His body was not recovered, but he was presumed killed and, in any event, could not be reached without heavy excavating equipment

"It seems that Galil Halunen was presumed killed in an explosion at the bottom of the shaft," says Leandra. She shakes her head, "The body was never recovered. They didn't have the equipment here to excavate."

The exploration is going well. Jiro remains wary, with his weapon at the ready. Trouble can be found almost anywhere in the world, and this axiom springs first and foremost into the soldier's mind as he is nearly hit - a brilliant lance of light darts past him, striking the wall behind. Jiro goes down immediately, crouching and bracing himself to return fire. His eyes scan quickly, trying to acquire a target.
