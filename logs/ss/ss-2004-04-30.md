# Synthetic Saints 2004-04-30

The crew has gathered outside an access hatch on the street in the Gate City. Tara Strang stands nearby, tapping at a datapad. Nothing seems unusual, save for Jiro's attire - the big armored battlesuit draws more than a few odd looks from passerby.

The hatch is a concrete kiosk at the head of an alley between two of the slablike buildings lining the walls of the gate, inside the city. The unmarked metal shutter gives no signs of its purpose, other than a bright yellow warning label announcing 'Authorized Personnel Only.'

Jiro flexes and twists about, testing the versatility of the armor's synthetic muscles. He makes a fist, then releases - his flesh-and-blood hands are encased in the armored vambraces, directing fully mechanical hands. The armor is painted bright "safety orange", with the distinctive Templar motif still intact on the chest.

Strang taps at her pad a few more times, then slips on a pair of datagoggles. "This hatch will take you into the primary reactor torus. Of course it's been powered down, and cannot be reactivated while personnel are inside. The accessways are roomy enough to accomadate maintainence drones - so there should be no problem with Uzuki's armor."

A signal in your goggles indicates incoming data. "I've just transmitted a map of the area, including your route. The volume we're asking you to examine can only be reached from a hatch inside the torus. It's just a few tunnels that go through the interior of some reinforcing stanchoins and bulkheads; we fully expect them to be empty. They aren't so much habitable space as manufacturing artifacts."

Strang frowns. "We had our share of runaway droids when we got here. The last one was more than fifteen months ago. Even so, I'll just remind you - some of the biggest dangers you can run into here, are co-opted machines. If you run into a compromised mechanism, you must keep it from reaching our network."

Archer nods. "Of course."

The walls of the tunnels in the display glow faintly. "The area is heavily shielded so radio communication is unlikely. Place a repeater at the hatch between the torus and the crawlspace. That will allow us to keep track of you, but it won't have the bandwidth to allow a hostile infomorph out of the bag."

Strang finishes, "I know you've been over it all before, and had a few scrapes of your own. Still, I hope the chance to get familiar with working on the Gate is useful to you." She smiles. "We contribute what we can."

"Heh. Keeping things from the network is my specialty. No worries there mate." Oi grins, "Just give me a minute or two to get things set up and taken care of. Heck, I'll even upgrade... well... naaah, on second thought that might be a bad idea."

Archer says, "Very likely, Oi. Let's not experiment with the systems here."

Leandra, for her part, is quiet. To her, this is perhaps not so much an exploration of an ancient machine, but more like the unsealing of an ancient tomb.

With that, Strang turns to board a tram. "I'll let you get to it, then. We'll keep an eye on you from the Embassy. Best of luck!"

Oi says, "Yeah yeah. You never let me have any fun," he comments, though clearly he's having fun right now. "Hrmmm. Alright then."

Archer bows. "After you, Captain."

The access hatch opens onto a narrow concrete landing. The ladder consists of broad steel rungs set into the walls of the shaft. The shaft itself looks less like concrete and more like asteroid regolith, sintered into a solid. The ladder descends down into the darkness of the giant machine.

Walking inside the fusion torus is much like walking down Main Street in the city above, save that the city is obviously meant for human habitation, and the torus is not. The interior surface has ridges that vary from a few centimeters to microscopic, and cover the walls in irregular pattern. The only flat surface is the plastic grating of the walkway, a bit more than a meter wide, set in the center of the floor. Maintainence lighting casts dim illumination over the scene; the flood lights on your vacc suits pick out areas of detail in stark contrast.

Set into the walls, halfway up either side, are straight crystal bands, flush with the surface of the torus. Each band is a meter long, and joins with the next band at an almost imperceptible angle. The strings of crystal stretches off over into the distance, and glitters brightly when your lights cross their length.

The grate seems to absorb the sound of your footsteps, even from Jiro's heavy suit, so the entire area is eerily quiet. The dim lighting is overlaid with brighter blue markers indicating the path to the access hatch, a hundred meters turnwise of your location.

Jiro spends a moment using his passive/active sensors, then a bright square of red light begins glowing on the hatch, courtesy of his lasers. "There," says the modulated voice. "I'll check it out. Come ahead in a moment."

Jiro advances the scant fifty meters to the hatch. The curve of the station makes it appear as if he's walking uphill. The only sound is a faint, muffled 'thud' as his armored boots strike the grating.

The hatch is secured by a large, recessed lever, marked in bright red. A metal label is marked with warnings in a dozen languages, stencilled with markings indicating radiation hazards, confined space hazards, atmospheric recycling hazards, and so on. In short... in indicates that this isn't a place well-suited to human habitation.

Jiro reaches out and easily slides the lever upright. The hatch sighs free and swings up from the floor of the torus, revealing another shaft about a meter wide.

Leandra continues to monitor the scanner closely, though her eyes do not forget that their business is also looking at her surroundings, as well. She hmms thoughtfully, but whatever she sees is kept to herself for now.

Jiro waits patiently for a moment, examining the NBC kit's readout in his head's up. "Leandra," he calls. "Environmental analysis?"

"Oxygen masks," suggests Jiro. "I'm heading in."

Leandra pulls her mask down and says, "This place is extremely well-shielded. The walls were grown, I believe, as well. The atmosphere is nearly void of water, with a slight elevation of heavy isotopes of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon." She doesn't sound very surprised.

"Right right." Oi looks about, considering the now open shaft. "So uhm... we're going in there are we?" He affixes his mask, "Where uhm... things. Blast, I'm going in aren't I. Alright. If I get eaten I'm coming back to haunt each and every one of you."

"You might as well continue as you have," says the Coulam drily. "As in death as in life." She almost smiles. Almost.

Archer says, "We have another relay to set up here, correct?"

Jiro swings out into the shaft, gingerly negotiating the rungs. The ladder descends another four meters and ends at a junction of two tunnels, one running parallel to the torus, the other running perpendicular. The only illumination is from the lights on his suit.

Archer sets a radio relay at the opening of the shaft, and waits for the others to enter before following.

Oi grins at Leandra. "You know... I think this could be the beginning of a beautiul friendship." He drops the Bogey accent, and then proceeds to follow Leandra. "Well... shall we then?"

The walls of the volume are made of the same sintered material as the access shaft. In fact, it appears that it's all been carved out of the same piece of solid, synthetic rock. There's no real indications that this place was ever used for human habitation - no lights, no ventilators, no sensors, no access points for cabling or power.

"The parallel tunnels I'll refer to as an Avenue," observes Jiro. "The perpendicular, up-sloped tunnels are Streets. The map doesn't say otherwise, and I'm not familiar enough with their designations yet."

The others descend the short ladder and stand in the intersection. The tunnels lead off in four directions, about three meters wide - passable, but by no means roomy.

"Well... here let me take a look at them. I know a little about Jump physics here. Just... a little." Oi can't hide the chuckle in his voice though. He taps a few times on the side of his vid-glasses, while reviewing facts in his mind. "Well then let's see..."

"Perhaps the crystals are a form of memory system," says Leandra. "Or perhaps they focus the energies in some way." She taps her oxygen mask and hmms. "Maybe someday we will know, rather than guess." She looks over at Oi, considering for a moment. "Do you know anything further about the quartz bands?"

"Well, you might be right Leandra. I mean, every time the gate jump is activated, they re-arrange themselves. Or rather the crystals get re-arranged. I'm not sure whether it's the gate or the energies that enable FTL that do this. The curious bit is that they're not hooked up to anything. No I/O you know. Bloody confusing... but, it's a start. I never thought I'd get to study one this close." Oi is examining the crystals rather closely, he uses his scanners on the vid-glasses to perform all manner of analytical sorts of thingies, programs, while he scans them. "Weird."

Jiro spends a moment dragging the "wireless signal strength" tool off the palette his computer presents, and positioning it prominently on his HUD. "No sense in getting out of contact, team," he calls back, in a friendly voice.

Archer says, "No point at all. Comm check, everyone?"

With the repeater Archer planted firmly in place, the signal strength indicators show a high level of signal to noise. Contact with the network in the City is, as predicted, significantly reduced, but still strong along a narrow range of channels.

"Alrighty. You're uhm, coming in loud and clear I think. Oh you meant... with the City. Hang on a tic." Oi, is too fascinated by the crystal bands to actually give a good test. "Hey, wait up a sec, I wanna take a closer look."

Meanwhile, Jiro has gone a short way down the turnwise Avenue. The material of the corridor does less to muffle his footsteps, and the hollow crunch of his boots landing echoes eerily down the curving corridor. Dust motes dance in the air.

The scanners clearly show that there's nothing to the end of the corridor, so Jiro turns around to inspect the opposite direction. The appearance of gravity lessens as he walks 'uphill' against the spin.

The other direction of the Avenue is nearly empty, save for a pile of debris at the end - a mass of rock chips, rock dust, and a few broken metal objects that look like they might have been drill heads.

Jiro returns to the intersection and inspects the 'Street', or transverse corrirors. Towards the ends of the tunnels, the slope against the gravity would make it harder to keep his footing - but the climbing pads on the outside of his armor make up for the impaired mobility. The left tunnel is empty, and ends in a rounded cul-de-sac. The right tunnel is similar... but the radon levels here are much higher. Also, an odd marking on the wall catches Jiro's eye... a sixteen-pointed gold starburst, embossed on a silver disc, about five centimeters across, on the side of the tunnel.

Jiro pauses a moment, studying the out-of-place symbol. Though politically not out of its element, its placement here strikes him as unusual. He begins cycling through his armor's passive and active sensors, studying the whole area and the symbol itself in great detail.

After a moment, Jiro backs out. He makes for the hatch, calling up. "Leandra, I'm going to need your sensors. Patch in remotely, it's not very healthy down here. I'll need you to analyze this for me."

After a moment's thought, he adds, "Oi, are you still busy? I think there's a Republic security apparatus down here."

Leandra nods to Jiro and will pass him her scanner. She will then wait and see just what it is that is going on down there. She wonders idly just how safe this little trip is right now. Then again, it is rather like a trial run.

Archer looks at the data feed. "Nothing unusual about the air mix. You've got sealed spaces surrounded by rock. Uranium traces will let radon accumulate - where's it going to go?"

"A Republic security apparatus?" Oi laughs. "Security apparati are one of my many specialties. Shall I come down there and see what's what? Or do you think I can dot aht from here..."

Oi says, "The breaking and entering I mean."

Jiro makes his way back to the end of the tunnel with Leandra's scanner, and detects a thin circular seam in the subjective 'cieling' of the Street.

"Nobody's coming down here while this stuff is in the air," says Jiro, firmly, studying the read-out for himself. He begins tapping out a quick message for the gate's people, informing them of the presence of radioactive materials in the air system, then studies the seam with magnified vision.

"Alright. Well if you want my help in getting past this, I'm more than happy to offer you my expert advice." Oi settles in, and returns to his analysis of the crystal bands.

The cleric thinks, and comes to a decision. "There is possibly a hatch here, and this symbol is possibly its lock. Oi, continue your research. Leandra, Archer, coordinate with city authorities. First, advise them of the radon levels. Second, find out about the recycling facility I see on the map here, see if they've noticed anything unusual there, or are processing anything unusual."

After a few minutes, a short message makes its way back from Station personnel - elevated radon levels inside similar tunnels are common. Maybe not as high as the spot where Jiro is standing, but high enough to be noteworthy.

"Oi, I want you to stay up there. Do you have motion-capture gloves on?" asks Jiro.

"I do... now..." says Oi, after a moment's work in actually affixing the things. "I've got the Power Gloves affixed. Whatcha need?"

Tele-operating Jiro's Armor, Oi disassembles the starburst symbol and finds a small induction reader for smart cards. Usually the cryptography protecting the reader is unbeatable, but the old saw about 'physical access means no security' proves true here... and after several minutes of tedious remote control work, Oi shorts the panel, and the circular panel pops upwards into the roof with a 'thump'. At the same time, there's a rush of air from the room above as the pressure equalizes. Jiro's sensors indicate a momentary spike in radon levels, and then they settle out again.

"Confirmed," the cleric reports crisply. "Radon emissions are coming from the hatch." He peers up into the newly-revealed area, cycling thruogh his sensors curiously.

"Hah. Problem solved." Oi grins. "You know, these things are great." He removes the gloves, then asks, "So... everything alright down there?"

Jiro peeks above the lip of the hatch. The room resembles nothing so much as a cluttered attic. The cieling is low, just a bit above two meters. The room might be a dozen meters long and half as wide, and is littered with plastic crates and fragments of crates.

Scrambling up past the lip of the hatch, Jiro is just able to stand without hitting his helmet against the cieling The room appears to be of the same construction as the rest of the area - a cavity left in sintered rock. The crates are mostly empty; some contain foodstuffs in foil wrappers, with markings that indicate they are over a hundred years old.

At one of the narrow ends of the room is an empty cot with the decayed remains of some blankets and bedding, and a desk that looks to be made from the broken remains of several shipping crates.

With much difficulty, Jiro deliberates with himself. Finally he concludes what he must: "Alright. Investigation. We have a concealed area here apparently not on the station's diagram. Archer, Oi, theories on why that might be are welcome, you'll have a steady feed of data to work with. Leandra, I want you to run a fine-toothed comb over this chamber. DNA traces, anything that might have once been alive. Don't spend too long in here."

Archer says, "We know they're not entirely certain of the void spaces. Probably just not on their maps."

Leandra joins Jiro in the hidden room, and runs a fine-tooth comb over the area... almost literally. Examining the bedding shows a number of human hairs stuck in the heavy synthetic wool blanket, which she extracts for later analysis. The room also contains a portable atmosphere scrubber, with a nuclear power cell that's been dead for over 110 years; a box with dozens of empty ration wrappers; and a chemical toilet. The makeshift desk also contains a case of scotch from New Queensland that must be nearly two centuries old, and a true oddity - a thick leather-bound pocket-sized notebook.

"We seem to be very good at digging up ghosts from New Queensland," remarks Jiro wryly, midway through the investigation, as he eyes the notebook casually.
