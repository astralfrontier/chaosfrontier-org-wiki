# Synthetic Saints 2004-05-14

Barely two hours have passed in the Crossroads system, and Team Aurora has already encountered their first anomoly: a small spacecraft of unfamiliar design jammed into a docking port on the perimeter of the Startgate. The image of the craft is barely up on the monitor before Jiro is pulling himself towards the launch bay where his armor waits.

Half a minute suffices for Jiro to arm himself, and all the while he's reporting his position to the rest of the team over the internal communication system. "I'm going to check it out," he finally reports, making use of the ship's handholds in the absense of terrestrial gravity.

Victor's virtual image appears on the monitor in front of Jiro. "This seems like a reckless course. Do you want me to accompany you?"

"Please," the man answers, curtly. The first fine edge of his paranoia is wearing off, though he's still intent on establishing hostility - or lack thereof - as he makes his way toward the breach point.

The infomorph sighs. "Somehow I knew you'd say that."

Oi continues to analyze the data from the telescopes as Jiro prepares to depart. Monitors on the bridge show Jiro stepping into the armored shell of his fighting suit, and the pieces clamshell shut in seconds. The armor detaches from its clamps on the wall and Jiro gingerly eases into a thruster pack.

The noise of Oi tapping on keys fills the bridge. "Well, there's not much to say about it yet. The radiation is introducing a lot of radio noise, so all this survey gear can't tell us much. It's a metallic cylinder about six meters long. And it's... uh... greyish. Or silver. Or something."

The lanky australite pushes his goggles up on his nose. "I'll let you know if I see anything. Just watch out for little grey men."

Jiro doesn't speak. He's too busy. The gate looms before him, a one-winged angel slumbering through a disease that nearly killed it. His sensors are projecting data into his HUD, and his eyes study the visual impression of the gate-section of interest, the magnification factor stepping down gradually as he approaches.

Crossing the kilometer between the Aurora's parking orbit and the drifting Gate takes less than ten minutes, but Jiro makes a bad estimate of the trajectory, and misses the docking port but a good fifty meters. He impacts the side of the space station with a sound like a bell being struck, that Archer would almost sweat he could hear even through the vaccum of space.

The efforts to stabilize the gate using the shuttles have made some gross corrections, and it turns out that it's possible to walk upright on the surface of the gate using the suit's adhesion pads. Jiro regains his footing and upright position amidst a cloud of spacedust; it seems the only thing bruised is his pride.

Victor appears in a window inside the holographic reality of Jiro's helmet. "I would slow down, my friend. I think whatever is in that launch bay has been waiting for some time."

"If it is hostile, its wait time is irrelevant," observes Jiro. "The time permitted to it to muster a response is what matters. Nevertheless, I concede your point." And with due patience, he uses his suit's own adhesive qualities, stepping carefully toward the launch bay and the enigma.

Oi continues to hammer on his terminal. "It's metallic, that's for sure. Probably steel by the look of it... oh, Jiro? What's that you're stepping on?"

Jiro is walking through a patch on the outside of the gate that, at first, appeared to be just a rough metal section, but on closer inspection is some kind of spongy, rubbery material, partially translucent and grey in places where space dust is caked on. The patch is roughly circular, six meters in diameter, and covers the hull between Jiro and the hatch.

Jiro hunkers down a bit, then begins cycling his sensors through their operating modes, and transmitting the received data to the Aurora itself. "Good question," he answers, after several seconds.

Leandra analyzes the readings via remote. "I think it's... silicone rubber. How odd. It's like someone spread a huge patch of adhesive on the hull of the gate."

"If it's not immediately dangerous, I'm proceeding," states Jiro.

The patch spreads to the edge of the docking port, where Jiro can clearly see the mysterious craft. It's not just a metallic cylinder; it's almost literally a metal can. The surface appears to be rivetted together from sheets several meters wide, and a round, dark viewport is set into one end. The other end is docked with an airlock.

Jiro's cameras pick out additional features on the outside of the craft - small chemical rockets arranged in thruster quads; mechanical clamps on the ventral side that could be for attachment of equipment; traces of the same silicone gunk that was on the skin of the gate are also visible on the bottom of the craft.

The outside of the gate still swings wildly from time to time as Archer and Oi fire the thrusters on the Walkabout shuttles to correct the wobbles in its rotation; the stars in the space beyond careen wildly from side to side, and if not for the mechanical strength of Jiro's suit, he'd have a hard time standing upright.

A single sharp rap on the back of the craft, augmented by some of the battlemover's artificial muscles, and Jiro waits. He pounds again, three times. Another long delay, and five sharp pounds.

Oi perks up. "If you're sending primes, you forgot to do '2'. I mean, isn't that what you're supposed to do with aliens? Send prime numbers?"

Jiro shines a bright wrist-lamp through the front viewport. The craft is about three meters across on the outside, and a little more than two meters across on the inside. Crude plastic benches with straps and harnesses for a half a dozen men line the sides. The back half of the craft is crammed with plastic packing crates and pieces of debris.

Something near the front of the craft catches Jiro's eye: a more modern-looking navigation console, amidst a tangle of wires and electromechanical relays.

"It's called the Barracks Alarm Clock," answers Jiro, as he stops pounding, and starts examining the airlock mechanism with an attentive eye. "If you're asleep, and someone has to wake you up, you owe them one per every knock it took. If your sergeant found you, it was that many push-ups."

The stern of the craft is perfectly mated with a round airlock tunnel extending from the wall of the docking port. A smaller hatch is to the side of the main hatch that looks like it's intended for maintainence personnel on EVA.

The maintainence hatch opens with a groan of stressed metal. The hatches are unpowered, but respond to mechanical overrides, and in a few minutes Jiro is standing in the hallway beyond. The airlock leading into the mystery craft lolls open on neglected hinges. From the other side, a pile of packing crates greets Jiro's questing gaze. Many are marked as foodstuffs, medical supplies, and small electronic devices such as PDA's and transciever components.

"Any of this technology look familiar?" asks Jiro, over the link. He eyes his signal-strength reading somewhat dubiously, then focuses his suit's sensors on the scattered flotsam and jetsam.

A more thorough search of the shuttle turns up about three dozen crates filled with assorted manufactured items - emergency rations, electronic components, and medical supplies. Most of the medications have long since expired. All have dates of manufacture and packing indicating that they must have been made before the gate crash. The navigation console of the small shuttle is intact, but unpowered. It's nestled into a complex array of wires and archaic electromechanical relays. A few other gadgets near the nose of the strange shuttle are connected to the thruster quads on the outside, and look more like pieces of a pipe organ than a spacecraft.

The first attempt to power up the nav console fails - it's hard to work through remote control, and the bandwidth available to Oi and Jiro for tele-operation is limited. After a half an hour of fumbling in zero-gee with Jiro's armored gauntlets, the two manage to patch a temporary power supply from Jiro's thruster pack to the old computer. The screen flickers to life, and attempts to project a hologram several times, then gives up and simply renders a 2d display on its surface.

Archer watches the computer experts work on things. While he waits, he instructs the comm system to sweep the main dish receiver across the vicinity of each of the local worlds, listening for stray wisps of radio noise. _There ought to be something **somewhere** in the system._

The old machine is no match at all for Oi, and the last program is still in the flight control computer. The improvised spacecraft was launched from the asteroid colony of Dromedary, some 18 million kilometers closer to XR2 than the Stargate. It docked at the gate over fifteen years ago and has been sitting here ever since. The combination of 27th-century flight computer and 19th-century engineering is an amazing hodge-podge of spaghetti programming and garage engineering.

"Heh. Ancient machinery. Gotta love it." Oi reports his findings to the rest of his shipmates. "Y'know, this sort of reminds me of the things I'd use to make when I was younger... except I rather don't think there's gonna be a stinkbomb in there somewhere."

"Archer, start doing computations to reach Dromedary," instructs Jiro. "If this tin can was transmitting messages back to its home, its computer should know where to aim a signal."

Archer has already instructed his comm sweep to concentrate on Dromedary. "Roger that."

Archer grins. "And.. yes, we've got radio talk out that way. Intermittent, apparently broadcast stuff rather than tight-beam. I'm recording the traffic, I'll put it on the speakers if you want." He checks the database. "Good ephemera for it. Dromedary's an asteroid, nearly two kilometers on its longest axis."

Archer continues. "It orbits the XR2 Jovian; we've got a couple days before it gets eclipsed for about 24 hours from this angle if we want to try talking to them, then a couple weeks before the next eclipse."

"Alright. Make that priority one, Archer," calls back Jiro. "Oi, if anyone's still alive on the gate, they will be trying to make contact with us in the next day or so. I don't think we have time for a room-to-room search for now, but if we can get internal communications going in the gate, that'll be a big help. Leandra, I know we're pretty spartan here, but a psychological analysis and reconstruction of events would be very helpful."

Jiro continues to rummage through the boxes loaded on the improvised shuttle. No trace of the crew can be found... but he does find an odd set of canisters bolted to one wall, containing a brownish organic sludge - quite cold and dead, but odd in its presence.

Oi grins. "Internal communications eh? Well I'll tell you what... you give me a few hours, and I'll see just what it is I can have up and running."

Archer spends some time analyzing the signals. "Hmmm. Leandra, you can plug this into your analysis; what I'm getting is apparently primitive telemetry. Analog signals, not digital, and I'm not reading any voice transmissions. Weird. I can send a voice-code signal by that channel, but no guarantee that it'll be recognized quickly."

"From what we can see so far," says Leandra, "We can guess that the shuttle was patched together, and they clearly have some very poor technology. The crew is missing, but we have found no bodies. Why would they leave? How would they leave?" The Coulam considers for a moment before continuing.

"They had some means to stabalize the gate, and considering the rest of what they have.. that seems impossible. The computer on that ship must be extremely well designed to handle the task." She pauses again, more to make people wait on her every word than anything else. "One can only guess that the crew is dead or that they had to leave in a hurry. Judging from their other technology, it is strange that they did not make a concerted effort to take the gate back."

Archer says, "They _may_ have tried and failed..."

The Coulam again pauses for thought. Or to make people wait. "If anything could be safely brought back, it may give us some clue as to what happened here. Though I'm not entirely sure what to suggest."

"There's an unknown chemical here," suggests Jiro. "I'll see about obtaining a sample and returning with it. Leandra, I'd like you to begin prepping quarantine, just in case. There's also the matter of that surface material, I'll see what I can dig up there.."

Oi takes time away from guiding the Walkabouts on their mission to stabilize the gate, and tries to find other operational systems on board to co-opt... he doesn't have much luck in detecting any automation that's still running, but he does find out that the solar arrays that are still in direct sunlight are running the backup power grid. There should be emergency lights on inside the gate, and some other auxiliary systems.

Jiro places some of the odd sludge in an empty canister from the floor of the abandoned shuttle, and straps it into his thruster pack. The pack flies back to the Aurora on its own. Leandra recovers the sample and directs the pack to return to Jiro while she does her analysis. Several hours of intensive scanning reveal that the sludge is the dead and dessicated remains of an odd strain of anaerobic bacterial culture, a kind of living air scrubber that removes carbon monoxide, dioxide, and other contaminants from air. Sequencing its genome may take several weeks, so the full extent of the origin of the organism isn't yet known.

Archer, meanwhile, divides his attention between the Walkabout shuttles, which have eliminated most of the eccentricity from the gate's rotation, and the weak radio signals coming from the Dromedary asteroid. The signals all appear to be analog-encoded telemetry - a dozens of channels describing the state of some unknown machines. Only rarely does Archer catch a piece of squawk that might be someone's FM voice transmission, and those aren't clear enough to be intelligible.

Jiro and Oi work in an unlikely team to give Oi more access to the gate's computers... but at the moment, there doesn't appear to be much that Oi can hack into. It's all powered down. Nothing more intelligent than a light switch is directly reachable from the outside. Over the next few hours, Jiro pulls the covers off a dozen maintainence hatches looking for live communications cabling, finding only dark fiber and dust.

After hours of signalling on two dozen radio bands, Archer finally tries the direct approach and sends an archaic FM voice transmission right at the known position of Dromedary using a directional antenna and a high power output. The recorded message loops for nearly half an hour before he gets a response - but not the response he expected. Suddenly the radio transmissions from Dromedary cease, leaving only a background hum of radiation from the bright blue dwarf of XR1 on the speakers.
