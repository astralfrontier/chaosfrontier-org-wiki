# Synthetic Saints 2004-05-27

After Jiro narrowly escapes being trapped inside the Embassy, the crew is left pondering their options. Jiro stands out in the Street that runs the length of the Gate; the rest of the crew is aboard the Aurora, observing via remote sensors.

"I have a bad feeling about this," reports the captain via radio. "There's something active here. We need to undock Aurora and move her to a safer location - priority one."

Oi works the remote sensors from a console on the bridge, but the readings are being remarkably inconsistent. Finally he gives up and starts a reboot.

Jiro hears a brief status report over the radio, and begins to worry. "If this is another rampant entity, be very careful - if it's gotten itself into our systems we're in serious trouble." He begins checking over his weapons methodically, still examining the closed door of the embassy and keeping his scanners running.

Leandra frowns in thought as Oi demonstrates his skills. "Well, since we won't be learning anything that way for a while.." She doesn't grin. She'll laugh at this later, assuming she's alive to do so.

Victor rezzes in beside Jiro. "Welcome back. Did I hear you mention a 'rampant entity'?"

"We will. Just give me a few minutes. It's not MY fault that I'm not allowed to fiddle with the core programming of the ship. If it were up to me, I'd have this whole thing redesigned... well... hmmm..." Oi grins. "Er, I mean uhm, yes... give me a minute or ten."

Jiro lets Oi update the crew, then nods to Victor. "What you just heard," he says. "It's just speculation. But two beings are dead in there - long dead. Perhaps as long as the small pod has been docked here..."

The progress bar on Oi's console craws up slowly towards 100%, and gives no indication of being anything other than an inconvenient mistake.

Archer glares. "And this is precisely why. You don't experiment with critical systems."

Oi replies, "Yeah, I didn't experiment with them and they crashed."

Victor nods. "Do you think they were killed by that entity? Is it safe here?"

Jiro shakes his head. "Insufficient data," he replies calmly. "To answer both questions. But we have some facts available to us. Oi, let me know when you're back online, please. I'm returning now."

Victor nods and derezzes, as Jiro makes his way back up the concourse to the Aurora's docking port.

Archer says, "Doesn't have to be an AI. Guardian programs to protect the Embassy are possible, aren't they?"

Jiro nods. "I'm just concerned that our sensor failure is related. It could be a coincidence.."

The sensors come back online, and Oi runs another sweep, supplementing the ship's sensors with the feed from Jiro's battlesuit. It seems that the Embassy has power, and some systems are operating inside - but it isn't running on the passive solar arrays that are running the lights. In fact, it seems the two systems are totally seperate. The thick walls of the Embassy prevent a very precise scan.

Oi shares this information with the rest of the crew. "Well... it might be worth the risk to try and hack into the internal sensors on the Embassy. Makes you wonder what's powering it though, doesn't it?"

"Just be careful you do not get hacked in return," says Leandra, her voice more flat than usual. Her opinion of hacking is never going to change. "There are reasons we are wary of talking too freely with those computers."

Oi says, "Which is why I'd do it from a secure terminal, unconnected to the rest of our systems. And besides, it might be worth it. Who knows... we could find some alien colony in there somewhere."

Archer undocks the Aurora from the Gate, and backs off into a parking orbit around the derilect space station. With the spin stabilized, some of the space junk that was near the gate has shifted and settled.

Over the following several days, Oi and Archer use one of the shuttles to inspect the communications arrays on the outside of the Stargate. The antennas and relays are intact, merely powered down; and as a side-effect, the team now has a high-detail scan of the surface of the Stargate. They locate a second open docking port, and nearby, another broad patch of the silicone-based adhesive that Jiro stumbled across near the port where the 'tin can' is docked. This second docking port is empty.

With an aptitude that surprised everyone, Oi performs six different space walks without a hitch or even a case of motion sickness. By the end of the week, the communications and power grids will be ready for operation.

Meanwhile, Jiro and Leandra examine the area around the Embassy, starting with the ransacked comissary. In the dim and dusty lighting, it looks much the same as when Jiro left it - a small building off the main street, its sidewalks overgrown with weeds.

Leandra makes her observations after careful study. "They took many medical supplies," she says, indicating several empty shelves. "It is hard to say whether this was done for the moment or as part of the visit to this place. Jiro, did you see any supplies in by the bodies? It would be interesting to know if any missions here got away alive before the failed one."

Archer says, "There does seem to be at least one other docking site."

"The plants here are rather simple and nothing surprising," says Leandra. "They were planted for the usual reasons. They were the easiest to tend and as we can all see, the most likely to survive." She continues, her tone calm and even, "Those here curiously did not take electronics, it would seem they instead took junk food and clothing, none of which is likely to be much different than we have on our ship. I wonder why they even came here?"

During one of his transits, Jiro stops, pausing to listen. He doesn't make a move, unwilling for even one bundle of artificial muscle to flex.

"Uhm... hey guys..." Oi pipes up over the communications system, with a rather, amused and somewhat worried tone to his voice. "I've just realized, that well it's incredibly easy doing this software installation. I er, can't help but wonder if it wouldn't be easy for someone else to get ahold of the communications network? Or any of these other things?"

Leandra pauses in her steps just as Jiro does, frowning in thought for a moment. She remembers herself, then, and continues recording. "It seems the station is either haunted or has other occupants," she says casually. She wonders how she might draw them out.. she wonders if she should draw them out.

Archer says, "Probably easy enough. But who's here to do it?"

"Weeee-ee-eeell... isn't that the million dollar question?" Oi chuckles nervously, "I have a feeling we might be figuring it out soon enough."

Archer says, "I thought your little ionic overcharge scheme didn't find any movement?"

"Leandra," murmurs Jiro over the link. "Sound sensors. Do we have some here? I need to amplify a sound. Archer, to answer your question, it didn't find any movement outside a large and sealed region - the embassy."

Archer says, "Well, yes - but I don't think the Embassy has any of the local folks living there. The machines don't seem friendly - and humans would've cleaned up the bodies sooner or later."

"Could be. You don't know. Maybe it's some kind of human/machine thing like that guy. Or, who knows? We'll find out soon enough, I wager. What are you guys hearing?" Oi's curiosity is getting the better of him.

"It's.. meaningless," murmurs Leandra softly. "I can hear it, but it's.. it's nothing. Perhaps a malfunctioning communication device of some sort? Perhaps it was a machine meant to speak?"

"I'm transmitting a copy now," reports Jiro. "Archer, I suspect that someone or something that was hibernating. But we need more facts. Oi, see what you can do with this sound sample." And so saying, he motions, directing a file-transfer back to Aurora.

Even as Jiro speaks, the babble suddenly becomes coherent, for a moment. _It is not safe. You must leave. Do not rebuild the antennas._

Archer blinks. "Did you all get that? Whatever it is doesn't want the antenna grid reactivated."

As a soldier, Jiro understands the value of instincts. "Oi, discontinue the communications repairs," he directs, quickly and crisply. Then, facing the wall, he speaks more softly. "Can you understand me?"

"Okay, something is very strange here," says Leandra. "It's talking to us, now." She believes machines are alive, of course, but to have one speak to you like this. She keeps a sharp eye about and leaves the talking to Jiro.

The babble continues. A dozen seconds pass, and then a single word floats to the top of the noise. _Almost._

"I am a friend," says Jiro, more audibly, consciously choosing the simplest words and expressions he can. "I want to help."

A longer pause. The murmur of sound rises and falls. Then, _You must not let it out. We are contained here._

Slowly Jiro considers and digests this. "Are 'we' and 'it' different?" he asks. "What are you like?"

A half a minute passes, and the sound rises and falls. It seems to come from a larger part of the wall now.

Nealy a minute has passed before the phantom voice speaks again, very quietly. _We were once two. We are now it. It is not safe here. You must leave. Do not force us._

"We will leave, but we must return sometime," says Jiro, speaking calmly and levelly. "Is it permitted to ask you more questions?"

The noise continues for over a minute. _It is difficult to speak. Difficult to be seperate from it._ A pause of a few seconds. _A decision is made. Starve us both._

"We will do what you ask," says Jiro. "Starve you of power? Air? Or something else?"

"I think we need to cut power," suggests Leandra. "I think that is what it is suggesting.. but.. they will die." And to her, that's a hard thing to handle, it seems.

Archer says, "I read that as two entities, one of which sacrificed itself to control the other - but it's tired and wants to end it all."

The added volume and tone of the voice is just perceptible. _Yes - stop power inside. Fear not for me. This is not the only battlefield._ A pause. _I knew this might come. Bring me hope._

The murmuring suddenly stops.

"Right." Jiro settles in for a few moments, thinking, and comes to a decision. "We'll do what it asks," he announces. "Oi, Archer, Leandra, if you aren't wearing armor, put some on. I want everyone armed. We need to get into the embassy and cut off the power system."

Leandra frowns and sighs. "It's.. it's really a soul," she whispers faintly, her words so soft they can barely be picked-up at all. "We will honor its wishes. We must free it."

"Every soul has the right to seek the end it wishes, Leandra," smiles the cleric. "We're going to try to get the remains inside out as well, so please prepare for a medical examination."

"Er... mmm hmm. You know, this is really rather puzzling. Armor... sure." Oi slips on his bodyarmor, and from his personal effects, retrieves his Gauss weapon. "Very well then... armed and armored. Well I will be anyway."

Archer is getting ready as well, though he still prefers his antique pistol.

Jiro begins examining a projection of the map of the gate - or at least, the gate he's familiar with. "We're looking for an external power plant first - if we can't find one in a likely location quickly, we'll breach the door."

"Yeah. We're going to need to get through to the internal plant, I believe. If we're sure we're doing the right thing. So... first things first, we'll have to sever the links..." Oi muses over this, while reinforcing the firewalls, and in general beefing up the computer security.

The crew gathers minutes later, armed and wearing heavy vacc suits (and in Jiro's case, a battlesuit) at the entrance to the Embassy. The slab-sided building looks distinctly ominous and coffin-like in the dim emergency lighting - a mysterious and dark twenty-meter tall edifice. Leandra stands a few steps back from the others, looking grim and determined; Oi stands near Archer and Jiro, in contrast, looking somewhat uncertain while handling his gauss rifle.

In first is Jiro, and he stands guard, his suit's sensors peering around in every direction for physical danger. The doors have shut of their own accord before; he has no intention of letting them do so again, especially on one of his teammates. One by one the others enter, and Jiro hauls one of the heavy planters, his suit's stress gauges whining quietly in his ear and on his HUD. He lets go, ensuring that the team can exit the embassy if required. And so doing, he indicates the remains he saw before to Leandra. "Genetic analysis, if possible. But that can come later - let's concentrate on our first priority."

Archer nods. "According to the maps, the power plants should be on the lower levels." He looks around nervously.

Jiro hoists his rocket rifle confidently. "If that's not all there is, we're prepared," he replies with a grim confidence of tone.

Leandra does as told, getting to work right away with her scanners. She frowns in thought for a moment, but carries on. It is their will, they must be set free. She doesn't have to like it, though.

The first level of the Embassy is built around the foyer, made of a dark-colored marble-like material. The room is six meters tall, twenty meters long, and twenty wide. Hallways lead to the left and right, and through the rear wall, directly across from the entrance. The entrance to the rear hallway is where the two corpses lie in crumbled, dessicated heaps. The floor makes little sound as you walk.

The crew moves around in a group. The left and right hallways lead to offices and conference rooms; stepping gingerly over the bodies, you can see that the rear hallway ends in a bank of elevators, with side doors that are marked as stairwells.

After a few moments deliberation, the team descends via a stairwell, looking for the emergency reactors. The stairwell seems to have collapsed, or have been forced to collapse, below the first landing, and so only the first sublevel is reachable. The heavy fire-door opens into a large room about the size of the embassy's footprint (fifty meters square). The room is dark, except for the searchlights on your spacesuits... and the glinting of multi-colored lenses on more than a dozen service robots of various sizes.
