# Synthetic Saints 2004-06-24

With the backup generators to the mad AI shut down, the embassy is a quiet place. The only illumination comes from the searchlights built into the Aurora Team's spacesuits. The basement level is littered with the wreckage of drones, including several that appear to have been destroyed years ago, and also the mummified remains of five figures in orange spacesuits similar to the ones found on the upper level. The other two also remain where they were left, huddled in the darkness like archaeological specimens.

Jiro carries the uniformed corpses to the Aurora's sick bay, where Leandra performs a thorough analysis on each of them. Some of the conclusions are obvious - the two from the entry hall were killed by projectile weapons, similar to the ones that they were carrying; the other five, recovered from the basement, were killed by chemical lasers similar to the ones that the drones used. All were between the ages of 20 and 40 at the time of death, and genetic markers show that they came from a relatively isolated population, consistent with the spacers living on Dromedary. The space suits have only one marking - a patch on the shoulder with the silhouette of a camel on a white disc. Four of these are marked with a '1', and three are marked with a '2'. Both of the bodies from the entryway bear a '2'.

Inspecting the 'tin can' shuttle for forensic evidence is more difficult, and yields little results. Any biological traces appear to have been destroyed by the anaerobic bacteria in the rebreather tanks, and Leandra finds no analyzable material.

Archer helps with the grunt work of dealing with the bodies. "We should probably load them back on their ship and tow it with us."

Oi finds the backup vault in the Embassy, which contains optically encoded disks with the initialization program for the Gate's systems. The vault appears unbreached and is even free of dust. It takes several long hours, swapping between many multi-terabyte disks, to restore the Gate's system to some semblance of operation. The jump system is still inoperative, as is the strange generator system the team just deactivated, but the solar arrays and ion thrusters are operating, so the Gate's rotation will remain stable.

Oi sits hunched over a console on the Aurora's bridge, brow furrowed in concentration. "I've seen this mess before. Most of the computing cores were filled with random noise - or random-looking noise, anyway. But the stuff in the Embassy cores... we've seen that before." His hands dance over the terminal, sometimes poking at icons in the holographic display. "In fact, I think we've seen it at least twice."

Archer says, "The AI again, eh?"

Oi nods. "Yeah. Signed with the same cryptographic identifiers - TAC, and SG. With SG marked as a German-language phrase." He hits some more keys. "Nothing from that sleeper, Halunen, though."

Archer says, "That's good, since he's in another star system. TAC and SG are part of the AI matrix, then."

"With each answer more mysteries," murmurs Leandra. She is paying attention, but she has nothing to offer to clear up what has been found. "Hopefully we will learn something of use from those on Dromedary."

Archer says, "If we haven't scared them so far down a hole that they've pulled it in after them."

Jiro and Archer set out on their inspection of the Gate, walking widdershins along Main Street in a complete circuit of the torus. The old space station looks different and feels different with power restored. The gravity is a steady 0.8G, with none of the mild but disquieting variations of the previous day, and the lights, while still dim, provide a uniform simulation of twilight. The holographic starfield flickers in and out of operation; apparently there isn't sufficient power for that system yet.

Archer keeps his eyes open for any additional robots. "We should probably figure out how to shut the holofield down - the batteries aren't going to charge if it keeps draining them."

Jiro waves a hand. "Nonessential systems should be shut down anyway," he suggests. "That voice warned us about the communications relay. Whether that subsystem - and maybe others - is infected or not, or whether it could have simply been used as a contagion vector, I'd rather be sure of everything here."

The starfield flickers a few more times, as if to punctuate Archer's words. The brighter lighting reveals other signs of the Crash; broken ties in the light-rail track, smashed windows, and the occasional smashed bit of automation. Jiro and Archer pass no other human corpses, and after half an hour of picking their way through the remains of the city, come back to the entry port where the 'tin can' is docked, a quarter turn around the Gate from the Aurora.

Archer nods. "So let's make a list of things to deactivate."

Jiro nods. "I would say anything but life-support, the station-keeping engines, sensors, and external communications is nonessential," he offers. "We have our radios for now, and if Oi's operating system backups are complete, we can purify those first."

At the end of the day, Oi announces that the auxiliary systems are as stable as he can get them in a hurry, but that the jump system is still offline. The asteroid called Dromedary is now just visible on long-range telescopes, coming out from behind the corona of XR2. With the primitive 'tin can' space vehicle stored in a docking bay, the Aurora begins a slow thruster burn to intercept the isolated colony.

Despite the constant broadcast at regular intervals, including recordings of the Domwun Symphony Orchestra and meditative chanting recorded in Exile temples, the Dromedarians do not signal back. The only detectable emissions are the radioactive and thermal signatures of crude fission plants operating on the surface.

As the mission makes its way towards Dromedary, Leandra reports her findings. Most of the plain facts are known. "I have yet to locate the mission log for the people of Dromedary who can to the gate. The thing of greatest note is that two of the dead were apparently not slain by the automated defenses. They were slain with projectile weaponry. Judging from what I have found thus far, they were killed by the same type of weapon, possibly the same weapon."

"Both men were slain at point blank range," Leandra adds, frowning. Even speaking of killing things draws a strong reaction. "It is hard to say whether they were slain at the same time or not, but it would seem very likely. I will provide more information as I find it, but.. the site is far from ideal, and the tin can is still hiding some secret, I imagine. Perhaps Oi and I can learn more later."

Archer says, "Perhaps you can at that. I had a thought about it... Leandra, could those flashing lights have hypnotized some of them into attacking their own party?"

Leandra pauses to consider for a bit, then frowns. "It is... possible, I suppose. The requirements for it would be remarkable." She says nothing else yet. Clearly this will have her doing still more investigation into just what happened on that gate.

Nodding, Jiro collates for a moment. "This changes little, but it gives a clearer reason for the Dromedary inhabitants to fear us," he says at last. "Especially if the team who escaped the gate concluded the same things. Here are our objectives, as I see them. Our first priority is security: there is a medium probability that they will attack us pre-emptively. Our second is communication. Depending on whether factionalism existed and/or still exists, this will probably be easier, as the chances that any one faction may wish to contact us are better than the chances of a unified but fearful populace wishing to do the same."

"Their reactions are likely to be drawn from one of a few basic emotional responses," continues the cleric. "These are mistrust, fear, anger or need. Mistrust can be overcome with communication and signs of friendship. To that end I proposed bringing the 'tin can' and the bodies back with us. Burial of the bodies of fallen comrades is one of the most primal human traditions, and we must not come as scientifically advanced saviors, but as fellow men. Fear can be fought if we do not seem to threaten them. That is why I am going unarmored and lightly armed. I don't expect any of you to come with me for the first encounter. Anger can be solved by negotiation, if we can analyze the root cause. Need can be satisfied if we can supply whatever it is - food, medicine, space, etc."

Archer sighs. "We've just got to convince them that we're on the level. Let's hope they hold fire long enough to do that."

"I think this is a wise course of action," says Leandra. "Remember that they may well know nothing of Coulam. My appearance might cause difficulties, and history has shown us that humans react poorly when confronted with beings like them, yet not quite like them."

Oi looks stunned for a few moments, then just says simply, "Umm... yeah." Clearly the young hacker is out of his depth dealing with soft-coded beings.

Archer nods. "She's right, y'know. Heck, for a while there were entire political systems based on the idea that having the right skin color was a prerequisite for political power."

Jiro smiles and shrugs a bit. "If they turn out to be a body of crazy murderers, I will be surprised," he says. "However, there's dozens of men like me on Ayer, and I've already pledged myself to die if necessary on this project. Best if I go find out what we're up against before anyone else steps into harm's way."

After two days in flight, the asteroid of Dromedary is close enough to see with the unaided eye - insofar as such a thing is possible on a starship. Even so, the sensors pick out the lumpy former comet without high magnification. It's at this time that the Dromedarians finally break radio silence with a single message. "Spacecraft Aurora, this is Dromedary. Stand off in local orbit at a distance of no less than ten kilometers from our surface and await further instructions. Do not approach closer than ten kilometers." The message repeats three times and then all is silence once more.

"Dromedary, Aurora acknowledges. We comply. Our intentions are not hostile," relays Jiro through the communications system. He waves a hand to Archer, nodding in support of station-keeping. Once contact is broken, he signals Oi as well. "Keep a very sharp eye out," he cautions, sternly.

Oi taps at the sensor console. "Jeez, it's a rock. Hollowed out like a worm-eaten apple. Lots of small fission plants on the surface... makes it hard to scan anything inside. I might be able to see more if I use active sensors..." He looks over at the others, and decides against it. "But I guess that would be the wrong thing to do. In any case I don't see anything that says 'I'm a big freaking gun.'

Jiro shakes his head. "Nothing active," he says quickly. "They can't object to telescopes and navigational radar though."

Archer says, "Just as well." He decides on a parking orbit 100 kilometers above the surface, to give the locals a nice wide safety margin.

Victor flickers into display at Jiro's crew station, and speaks in a low voice. "I didn't want to say anything in front of all the others, Jiro, but you seem to be taking a large risk by volunteering to be the sole diplomatic contact. I cannot say if this is good or ill." He pauses. "I think I can say it is a selfless and self-sacrificing act."

Jiro nods slowly. "You're right, it is," he observes. "Do you agree that a personal diplomatic overture is necessary, given the circumstances? And if so, do you suggest sending noncombatants into a potential danger zone?"

The infomorph shakes his head. "It's unclear what the best course of action is, even to me. On the one hand you are most qualified to make contact; on the other, if the team loses you, they also effectively lose their military options. The strongest motivation for contacting the Dromedarians is humanitarian. They have been isolated a long time. They probably want to have their world opened again. But I can think of little that is selfish to serve as motivation. I trust selfishness over altruism with humans I don't know. It's more reliable."

Several hours tick by, during which Oi detects several powerful radar scans directed at the Aurora, powerful enough to image the hull, but not to penetrate the metal skin. Finally, another radio transmission arrives. "Aurora, this is Dromedary. Insert our shuttle into orbit at an altitude of 50 kilometers and retreat with all your personnel back to your current position." Again, the message repeats a few times, then is followed by silence.

Jiro motions for the others to join him, and heads down to the bay to facilitate the order. "Sounds like they want to check things out themselves first," he says. Along the way, a thought occurs to him, and he bridges his radio gear to Aurora's main transmitter. "There are forensic anomalies in the bodies we have," he transmits. "You will see for yourselves, but we might be able to explain details, if you are interested."

A different voice replies to Jiro, relayed from Aurora's bridge. The new voice is female. "Aurora, understood, proceed as directed, more instructions will be coming soon."

"We comply," replies Jiro. "We are beginning insertion. One object will detach from our hull; that is your shuttle."

Archer remains on the bridge as the others go to the cargo bay. When the Dromedary control requests the dropoff, he initiates the sequence that's been plotted out. First, the retro-thrust which paradoxically speeds the ship as it drops to the lower orbit, then a forward thrust when the desired 50 km height is reached, to stay in a circular orbit at the new altitude. Once that's been achieved, he tells the others. "Ready to release."

Jiro replies, "Go ahead when ready." For his part, he's personally watching the little shuttle's fate from the viewport adjacent to the bay where it resides.

Archer releases the docking clamps on the Tin Can and reverses thrusters momentarily to allow the small spacecraft to 'fall' out of the docking bay on its inertia. Once the vessel has reached two hundred meters distance, he nudges the thrusters again and begins the burn to take the Aurora back to its higher orbit. As he does so, an indicator on Oi's console chimes. The young hacker taps at the keypad and looks surprised. "Incoming transmission from Dromedary... on a very narrow band. I think it's supposed to be private."

A voice crackles through the bridge speakers, distorted by the narrowband single-sideband encoding on the transmission. "Aurora, this is Dromedary. Please explain your 'forensic anomolies'." The message pauses, and then repeats - but it doesn't sound like it's a recording.

Jiro returns to the bridge quickly, then re-establishes communication, replying on the same band. "Seven bodies were found. In five cases we established the cause of death as laser, and encountered remote drones carrying similar weapons. We believe those drones, or similar models, were responsible. The other two were killed by projectile weapons, of a similar type to the weapons we found."

On the surface of the asteroid below, a large hatch opens, revealing a landing bay fifty meters across. A space vessel a little smaller than the Tin Can, but with much larger engines, emerges. Periodically, the maneuvering thrusters on the vessel will glow orange with a gout of chemical rocket exhaust; the machine clears the asteroid's docking bay and begins a slow climb to match orbits with the Tin Can, even as Aurora begins a faster climb to leave it behind.

The voice comes back, a hint of trepidation coming through even with the poor-quality of the low-tech, low-power transmission. "Aurora, please describe the laser and projectile weapons you found."

Jiro briefly describes the weapons the drones had first. His postmortem of the battle included a 'best guess' estimate of power output, and he includes this data. "They didn't seem like battle-use lasers; more like repurposed tools," he concludes. "The rifles have been included with the bodies in your shuttle." And with this he briefly gives estimates on physical dimensions of the weapons, propellent used, caliber, and more.

"And now," adds Jiro, finishing his brief summary, "our doctor is coming on channel to describe the injuries in more detail. I'll explain our conjectures after that, if you wish." And he motions to Leandra.

Leandra explains succinctly what she found in her examinations. She recounts what Jiro has already said, explaining that five were slain by laser and two by projectile weapons. The projectile deaths earn far more of her attention. "We have reason to believe that the gate may have caused those on the mission to harm each other unintentionally, but we have no solid proof of this yet, save to say it is possible. It is also highly likely they were killed by the same weapon. The holes and angles of the wounds indicate they may have been slain one after another in a single spray."

Archer waits until Leandra is finished, then switches to internal vox circuit. "Be very very careful. They're nervous as the proverbial long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs down there. I was real close to hitting the main drives for a moment - but Leandra said the right thing."

There is a minute of silence. Meanwhile, the primitive tug is climbing to intercept the tin can. The radio crackles back into life, the same woman speaking. "Aurora, this is Shetal Windzi, Chair of the Dromedary Council. I speak for Dromedary. Please move to an orbit of 200 kilometers. We must make some internal arrangements before proceeding with contact. Will you allow us opportunity to make the appropriate preparations?"

"We are at your disposal," replies Jiro. "My name is Jiro Uzuki; we are natives of a planet called Ayer. We will take up high orbit and await your signal." He mutes the channel before letting out a long sigh of relief.

Less than a minute later, a second tug exits the same landing bay on Dromedary, and makes a harder burn to catch up with the first tug. There's a brief flurry of radio chatter on open channels. The first is the same harsh voice that first spoke over the radio when you made first contact. "Camelback, we see Tug 2 on the way, we made no request, please advise."

The reply comes back less than a second later. "Tug 1, Tug 2 is on discretionary dispatch. Follow instructions and maintain radio silence."

Archer nods to Jiro and gently nudges the thrusters to shift orbits again. The asteroid's gravity is weak, but not nonexistent - the high orbit will take more than a week to make a single circle, and the ship moves on a practically direct ballistic flight rather than the S-transfer orbits used around planets. "I think we'd best stay out of this."

The dialog continues. "Tug 2, I order you to return to dock." Tug 2 simply replies, "Negative."

Jiro nods slowly, then begins considering the matter. "Leandra," he says at last. "There's a chance someone may want to wipe out that shuttle for the evidence onboard. I want you to start assembling your forensics data and any logs you made while doing the investigation."

The harsh male voice on Tug 1 speaks again, sound irritated. "Dammit, Tug 2, this is a hazard situation, I have authority. Return to dock."

"Jiro, it has occurred to me that another possibility exists," says Leandra. "The men wore 1 or 2. What if they arrived and one killed the other?" The Coulam sighs, shaking her head, "What if this is a civil war?"

Archer says, "If it is, it's their civil war. Let them deal with it in their own way. We have no idea which side is preferable."

Jiro thinks a moment longer, then opens a transmission of his own, broadcasting to whomever may be listening. "Dromedary, this is Aurora. If it would be faster to receive records of our forensic analyses and mission data, we have a complete record." He discontinues transmission, then nods. "I thought the same thing," he admits. "There's evidence that a second tug left the gate, after all. In fact I consider it the likelier explanation, but I can't just say that to them."

The voice that you can only assume to be the dispatcher speaks again. "Tug 1, priority instruction. Follow strict hazard protocol and cease chatter immediately. Tug 2 has been dispatched to aid you. Proceed as discussed."

Archer chuckles. "Good thought. If they know the evidence is available, they'll be less likely to do something stupid to destroy it."

"We may be opening an old wound," says Leandra. "Perhaps they glossed past this and found a way to peace. Now they may be incapable of maintaining peace," she suggests. The Coulam frowns thoughtfully and taps her lip, "It would be an odd course that makes the truth so deadly."

Dromedary makes no reply to Jiro, but the radio chatter between the tugs and their dispatcher continues for a few more volleys. The voice of Tug 1 states, "Dammit, Camelback, shut your mouth, you don't order me to do anything. Tug 1 is proceeding with the mission. Tug 2, you've got a decision to make and you know it."

Tug 2 makes no reply. Camelback makes a final statement: "Tug 1, Council directs you to comply with hazard protocol or face censure. That means radio silence." Tug 1, apparently coming to some decision, makes no further noise.

Archer says, "Well, let's see what they do. Turn the telescope onto Tin Can and let's see what they'll do when they get there."

Over the course of the next several hours, the two clunky tugs dance around the larger cylindrical shuttle recovered by the Aurora. The magnified view throught the telescope shows each vessel extending a pair of bulky, crude pincer-style manipulators, latching onto lugs on the outside of the Tin Can. The three vessels draw together in a maneuver that is vaguely reminiscent of insects devouring each other; then there is the orange glow of thrusters as they edge their way out of orbit towards Dromedary.

---

Twelve hours elapse from between the retrieval of the Tin Can by the Dromedary tugs and the next transmission. The voice that claimed to be Shetal Windzi crackles over the radio. She sounds like she's trying very hard to keep emotion out of her voice, which is not hard on a narrowband voice link. "Aurora, this is Windzi, speaking on behalf of the Dromedary council. We welcome the diplomatic mission from Ayer and are ready to receive your ambassadors. Please take a landing craft to our tugs' docking bay; as Chairman of our council, it will be my priviledge to greet you upon your arrival."

"Windzi, Aurora acknowledges," radios Jiro. "I will come alone. In light of evidence from the gate and recent events, I will be coming lightly armed. I pray that you will understand why. It is my belief that trust is inevitable when people speak openly with each other, face to face, and I look forward to demonstrating our good intentions to you."

Windzi transmits, "It is agreed. We can work out details upon your arrival. I guarantee your reception under diplomatic terms." A pause. "Please understand this is a fragile habitat. Avoid inappropriate equipment."

"I understand. Our habitats have similar constraints," replies Jiro with a smile. "Aurora out."
