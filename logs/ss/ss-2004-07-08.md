# Synthetic Saints 2004-07-08

The following day, Shetal Windzi asks to speak to Jiro and Archer in her office. The small chamber is hewn out of the rock, and is only about four meters across. The walls are covered alternately with crude cloth banners and wire-frame baskets, the low-gravity substitute for shelving. The baskets contain a variety of objects - odds and ends of technological junk, pieces of clothing, even a few paper books. Windzi sits behind an open-frame steel desk, wearing a different patchwork spacesuit from yesterday, with more muted colors. Fatigue shows on her round face; she looks as if she hasn't slept much.

Windzi speaks. "I'm sorry about what happened yesterday, my friends. Under the circumstances, I thought it best if you were not informed of the results of the Gate Expedition of fifteen years ago, until after you presented your evidence. To do otherwise would have called the veracity of your findings into question. I'll answer your questions now."

"It's clear now that Miller was likely the leader of a second vessel," says Jiro. "I'm guessing two teams went. One returned - Miller, presumably alone. He reported the destruction of the detail. Perhaps he described entering a lower level and encountering hostile drones. Since then he has exhibited signs of guilt or reticence." The cleric sits back. "How close is that?"

Windzi nods slowly. "Very nearly dead-on, except for the 'guilt and reticence' part. Miller has always been our best pilot, both before and after the expedition. He was different before... nothing in space could scare him. That was why he was selected for the mission, although not as leader. When he returned..." She pauses. Clearly the memory is painful to her. "He was a different man. The laughter had gone out of him. He was still fearless, but he was also... far more distant."

Windzi folds her hand on the desk. "You must understand that we live in precarious circumstances. When the Crash came here, there was no biosphere even remotely habitable where we could retreat. We came here because it had water; that was the closest thing there was to a terrestrial world. Those first years were hard. Most people died. Our parents and grandparents spent years building this place up to support life. So we admire strength, and skill. Miller was always one of the strongest. When he came back, it didn't affect his competence at all. The people still followed him; many of us believe that a harder edge is necessary to survive here."

Windzi pauses. "Miller appeals to the survivalists among us. So any distance or reticence he possessed, was not a handicap."

Jiro nods slowly. "Then all that remains for us is to lift the burden he carries," he volunteers in a soft voice. "If it can be done. We understand what must have happened; if anything is necessary to help him, it is that."

Archer sighs. "And you're probably right about the hard edge. The unfortunate thing is, he may be feeling guilty for something that wasn't his fault. He may have had to shoot his own people if they were hypnotized by the AI."

Windzi nods, slowly. "That doesn't explain why he lied on his report. I do not think that Miller would have concealed that fact. He reported that the seven other members of the expedition were killed by hostile drones, and that he escaped in one of the transfer craft."

Windzi looks at her folded hands. "I... have a favor to ask."

Jiro waves a hand, inviting follow-through. "We are here to help you, after all."

Windzi says, "I understand the importance of precaution, and survival preparation. But... Miller was a close friend of mine once, long ago. There is a fine line between preparedness and paranoia. I want to know which side of that line he's on. He commands great respect here, and if the people who follow him can be persuaded to help you re-activate the Gate, then our future generations will have a chance to live a better life. It's not bad here... not anymore, anyway. But... we can't live forever like rabbits in a warren."

Windzi says, "Your doctor has offered to treat him. I do not believe he will accept. I would still appreciate it if you tried to find out what happened there, fifteen years ago."

Jiro nods again, attentively. "If it's necessary to ensure a smooth transition to reactivating the gate, we have no choice," he concludes.

Archer nods. "And if he won't talk to our doctor, maybe he'll talk to a fellow pilot - or a fellow officer."

Windzi says, "Perhaps. It has been some time since he talked to me. As outsiders you have the gift of a fresh perspective."

"On an earlier note," adds the cleric, after a moment's thought. "It's quite logical that he would lie on the report. You said that this community respects an 'edge' - in short, valor. The flip side of valor, Counselor, is pride in oneself. The strong man cannot bear to be defeated; shame will compel him to conceal such an event, if he lacks the willpower to resist the urge. And to commit the deeds we suspect, I'm certain the shock would have made many things possible."

---

Windzi escorts you to the area where Miller is being held. Apparently he's under house arrest. A guard with a slung machine rifles stand at ease outside the door to his quarters. He nods as you approach, but does not step aside. He looks inquisitively at Windzi.

Windzi speaks to the guard. "The physician from the Aurora has offered to examine Commander Miller."

The guard looks uncertain. "Commander Miller still has his rank, Counselor, and has asked to not be disturbed."

Windzi sighs. "Trooper, I shouldn't have to explain this to you. These are unusual circumstances. Let us pass."

The guard pauses a moment, then turns and raps on the door. "Commander! You have visitors!" And without waiting for a reply, he opens the door, and waves Windzi through.

Miller's quarters are a bit bigger than Winzdi's office - three meters wide and about seven meters long - but still quite cramped, with Jiro, Leandra, Archer, Windzi, and Miller himself present. Miller is sitting at a table, hands folded, and stares daggers at you. He does not rise as you enter. "So. Shetal. I see you've brought your new friends with you." The sneer in his voice is unmistakable, even if be betrays none on his pale, angular face."

Abruptly Jiro steps forward, closing to the table and pushing it aside. With the space open, he steps into it in a confrontational closeness with the spacer, then turns his attention back to Windzi. "Counselor, excuse me for a moment." That said, he returns to Miller himself. "Get up and hit me," he commands.

Miller stands slowly, nose to nose with Jiro. "What the hell are you trying to prove, son?"

"What are you?" retorts Jiro. "You don't like me, so take your shot. Let's get this bullshit out of the way."

Archer just watches with a raised eyebrow. He hasn't yet felt any urge to intervene, though.

Miller nods slowly and shoots a glance at Windzi. Windzi herself seems to understand what is going on, and ushers Leandra back in the half-second between that gesture, and when Miller swings at Jiro... a simple and direct right hook at Jiro's face.

Jiro twists rapidly with the impact, taking the blow squarely and falling heavily to the floor of the compartment. He regains one foot tepidly, raising a hand to his mouth and wiping away a hint of blood. "Feel better?" he asks in a slightly ragged voice.

Miller pants for a moment, surprised that Jiro didn't fight back. He slowly sits back down in his chair, arms crossed. "No," he says, simply. And after another moment, "Say what you came to say. I'm listening."

Jiro rises up, nodding at Leandra and Archer. "We were on the gate," he says, simply. "We saw a light. It hurt our eyes. I had alternate optics - passive radar, operating on the millimetric wavelength. They shut their eyes. We went further in. But I think that light would have done something to us if we'd kept looking at it."

Archer nods. "It would have. I sensed a ... wrongness about it, and knew to react."

Miller says simply, "The lights were a distraction. When the drones came, they had the advantage. Chopped us to bits." He pauses. "It's in my report."

Miller says again, after a moment, "You're here because you think it was more than that."

"Yeah, we do," says Jiro, levelly. "You want me to lay it on the line?"

Miller shrugs. "Fire away. My wings are suspended, not like I'm going anywhere else."

"I think you saw the light. I think you either blacked out or lost your memory. You're a pilot, and even with the fuels out here, you know about blackouts. I think your memory came back about the time you noticed some bodies on the floor, bodies that no laser had killed. I think you didn't really know what had happened to them, but you maybe suspected. I think you came back and filed your report because you didn't know what else to say, and 'I am afraid I shot those men' would be trouble, because no way in Hell was another living soul going to brave that gate." Jiro stops for breath, wiping his mouth again. "You're a tough, smart guy. A good leader. I think you had your guesses and decided it was best for all to just forget it."

"You didn't bring those bodies back - even one - at the time. Maybe you just didn't have time. But if you did, bringing back a corpse with bullets in it, bullets from somebody's gun who'd gone along, that would have been trouble. So you knew," says Jiro softly. "Commander, if any of this is what really happened, who are you helping by staying silent? Yourself, now under confinement to quarters for causing trouble with the pod transfer? Your colony, who needs a good pilot and a good officer? Your people, who have noticed your withdrawal and even now have been prepared to take you out ever since I arrived, if you made a wrong move?" He waits for a few seconds, studying the other man. "Your friends out there are home now. Whatever happened is in the past. Right now all we want is to get the gate running. To do that we need you. Not you in your quarters. You being the man these people look up to."

Miller looks increasingly agitated as Jiro speaks. Finally he stands up, and stalks to the back of the room, facing the wall. "Whether it's true or not... that... THING... might still be out there. It might be everywhere. Every gate in space, at the same time..." He spins back, a determined look on his face. "That wasn't coincidence. It couldn't be. What if we were the only place left? What if this was the only way to survive?"

Archer says, "We're not questioning your decision at the time. We just want to clear it up now, Commander."

"How will we ever know what dangers there are, if any, unless we rig the gates for operation?" asks Jiro, calmly. "My planet can't afford to hide away any more. We have to open up, or we may end up dying out. Your colony, as much of a testament to human power as anything I've ever seen, has to reach out too. The more gates we unseal, the more we'll learn about what's waiting for us. But we need guts to stay alive."

Miller deflates some, and sits on a cot at the back of the room. "You're going to do it with or without me. You're going to bring that thing back."

"No, we're not," says Jiro, emphatically, shaking his head. "Whatever that voice was, we're making sure it's gone. The gate computer network's been purged and restored by now. The rest... well, that's what we need the colony's help for."

Windzi steps forward, slowly. "Seren... do you remember when we were young? The promise you made to me before going to the gate?" A few moments of silence. "You don't, do you? You said, you were going to the Gate, with the others, because it was time to widen our world. Time to go back to the stars, because we couldn't stay here forever. You _believed_ that. What could have changed in one day?"

Miller looks up again. His face is carefully composed, but his hands are trembling. "I... don't know... what changed. But something did. I said we couldn't stay here forever, but... now... we _have_ to. It's waiting for us.

Archer nods. "The old system depended on the whims of one being, apparently. He seemed to have humanity's best interests at heart, but something went wrong. It's up to _all_ of us, now, to put things right again. Your people as well as ours, and the rest out there, wherever they are. That thing probably is waiting for us, some places. But this time we know it's there. And this time, we'll win."

Miller doesn't look up as he speaks his next words. "Who are you, and why have you come to me?"

Archer takes the question metaphorically. "We are the children of Ayer. We have come to re-open the Gates under Human management, not that of some benevolent master, and cleanse the Entity which tried to kill us all. And we are your opportunity for redemption, Commander."

Miller stands slowly, and nods once. He looks shaken, but his hands aren't trembling anymore. He starts to say something several times, then just says simply, "I'll think it over." A glance at Windzi. "Leave me alone."

Windzi nods, and opens the door. Clearly she expects you to precede her in leaving.

Jiro waves a hand at his shipmates as well; solitude is called for. "I apologize for us going past your guard, commander," he calls over his shoulder on the way out. "But I'm glad you talked to us."

Archer salutes Miller on his way out. "We'll be here if you wish to talk further, Commander."

Miller nods once. "I know what you lot are trying to do. But I'm not fool enough to resist just for that."
