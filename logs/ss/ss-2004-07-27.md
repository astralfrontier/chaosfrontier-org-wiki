# Synthetic Saints 2004-07-27

The Dromedary infirmary is quite spacious, compared to the rest of the asteroid colony, and luckily quite free of patients. Windzi and the Council have arranged for Leandra to interview Miller in an isolation lab in a corner of an otherwise open ward. The room is cleared of everything except a pair of padded chairs, and a pair of dark-suited troopers, unarmed. Both look ill at ease.

Miller is escorted in by Windzi. Windzi looks troubled; Miller looks irritated. He stops short of the isolation ward door and looks over the two orderlies. "Yes. I suppose I should have expected that." He looks across his shoulder at Windzi, and looks like he's about to say something... but then closes his mouth and stalks forward to one of the padded seats. "Let's get this over with."

Leandra sits at ease in one of the chairs. She looks more troubled by her clothing than by Miller or the guards. She motions for the other chair and smiles, "Yes, I imagine that is an attitude most would have. Do try to relax, else this may well prove impossible. We only want the truth, don't you agree?"

Miller shrugs. "Truth. Maybe. What do you think it is that drives me?"

"I do not know enough to have an opinion on that," answers Leandra. "But perhaps soon I will be able to make a fair judgement. For now, it will be best if you relax. If you have any questions for me about what we are doing today, please ask."

Miller settles into the chair. "I suppose a good question would be... how does this work? I've never been very susceptible to hypnosis before. I guess I didn't see the point."

"I will help you relax, and when you are properly prepared, I will guide you into a hypnotic state. You will be fully aware of yourself and your actions the entire time. You may remember what happens, you might forget. I leave that up to you." Leandra pauses, then goes on, "Normally hypnosis cannot cause you to take actions that you actively resist. This can be done only with the use of drugs, sleep deprivation, and other repulsive actions. Hypnosis is powerful, but it is by no means all-powerful."

Miller nods. "And if that's true," he says slowly, "then what sort of lasting effect could that odd light have had?"

Miller continues, "I mean... if hypnosis can't make you take actions against your will, then those blue lights couldn't have done more than distract us... right?"

"It is possible those lights used a subliminal pattern to make certain changes in the mind," says Leandra. "Whenever we deal with such advanced technology, we cannot be sure what we accept as probably is truly correct. Today we are going to be seeking what happened and what the lasting effect may be. Any buried suggestions can be worn away, in time. We just need to know what they are, and we can start fixing them."

Miller is silent for a moment, and then says, "I'd like a moment to speak to Windzi, alone."

The two orderlies take a short walk across the ward, but still within eyeshot. Windzi steps into the isolation room and exchanges a few words with Miller. Their voices don't rise above a whisper, but clearly Windzi is against whatever Miller is suggesting. After a few moments she returns and murmurs to Leandra. "Miller has requested a change in procedure. He'd like the orderlies to leave. He doesn't want to reveal anything in front of others; apparently, you're an outsider and don't count. I'll be armed. Will you agree to it?"

"If that is what is required," says Leandra. "Though I do not see the need for you to be armed." She seems unruffled, settling back in her chair slowly. "We'll want to dim the lights slightly. It tends to make things easier. The mind is used to relaxing when things are less bright."

One of the orderlies presents a sidearm to Windzi, and then the orderlies depart. "Miller requested that we do it this way." She steps to the door and touches the lightpad. The room dims.

Miller says, "I want to explain this to you, Doctor, so you understand. I'm stubborn, but I'm not an idiot. I want to know what happened. But I'm nothing on Dromedary without my reputation. I'm not asking anyone to hide anything. But if there's dirty work to do here... Windzi's the only one I'm going to trust to do it." He pauses a moment. "I'm not going to trust you, or your friends. Not for a long time. But we can do this today." A wry smile crosses his face. "And since you're an outsider... I don't think my position here is of any interest to you anyway. Professional detachment... right, Doctor?"

"All living things are an interest to me," answers Leandra. "My duty as a doctor is to see those around me feeling well and growing towards greater health." Her voice changes just slightly, growing softer as she speaks. She lifts a small stone from her lap. The stone starts to glow slightly, a concealed button squeezed to turn it on. "The focus helps you relax. As I count down from fifty to one, you will find tension draining slowly from your body." And with that calm voice she begins to count, pausing only to explain further just where the relaxation spreads, starting at the feet and going steadily up Miller's body.

It takes some time to put Miller under. It's clear that the man always lives at a very high level of tension; however, Leandra is an expert, and talks him down as the minutes tick away. Finally, Miller rests, eyes almost shut, arms limp on the sides of the padded seat.

Miller recounts the events of the Gate expedition of fifteen years ago. Two tranfer pods left Dromedary and made a slow transit to the Stargate over several days; one pod commanded by Miller, then just a Flight Lieutenant, and the other by Commander Ambrose. The two pods docked at opposite ends of the gate and used disposable rocket pods to stabilize the giant structure's rotation. He speaks mostly of the conditions aboard the pod - clearly, he and his fellows were used to long periods of confinement, and he doesn't regard the experience as unpleasant; he also recalls the thrill of the docking procedure, most of which he had to perform manually.

Miller continues his tale; the details match his report. The expedition encountered no resistance when they docked, and easily fulfilled their primary objective, which was to loot some of the storehouses on board the gate for non-perishable items that couldn't be manufactured on Dromedary. With plenty of time to spare, both crews met on the main street and scouted the Embassy. In his younger days, Miller was clearly far more brash. "I live for this kind of stuff... all those crazy theories about the crash, I'm here to kick some alien ass... heh. Maybe not really. They always come in peace in the comic books."

Leandra listens to the recounting of the mission, noting what is said with care. So far, it seems the official story is being stuck-to. She allows Miller to continue, waiting for him to speak of the less pleasant aspects of the mission, should he choose.

The next part of the story strikes Leandra as very odd. Miller loses a lot of inflection, and, even discounting the trance, seems distracted when he speaks. In fact, Leandra realizes, that he's recounting his written report almost word-for-word. "When we reached the second sub-level, we encountered odd illumination conditions. Soon after, six units of hostile automation, a common type of laser-armed drone, entered sublevel 2 and opened fire. We returned fire and sustained heavy losses due to the unidentified lighting effect. We dispatched the drones, but I was the only one to survive. I returned to Pod 2 and performed an emergency departure. The bodies of the expedition were not recovered due to potential interference from other automation."

Leandra makes note of the oddity in Miller's speaking. She waits for a moment, and then draws him back towards the start of the conflict, putting him in that place. "Use different words and tell me what you see and what happens. Go slowly and try to remember all that you can," she suggests.

Miller stops for a moment. "When we reached... I remember walking down the hall towards..."

Miller speaks slowly. "We just finished sweeping the entry level... it's so clean. Almost nothing out of place, like it was abandoned yesterday. We're walking down the hall towards the elevator. Ambrose tells Zane and Adolfo to wait here... we step inside, the doors are closing. It's dark. All I can see is the lights on our suits, and the lights on the control panel. It's odd. The rest of the place is so well lit."

Miller continues, "The doors open... we're in a sub-level. The map says it's a warehouse level. There's drones here... mostly busted junk... well... there's a few that might still be operable, but they're shut down. They're all armed with lasers. Leola removes the fuel cells from their welders. Without those they're just tin cans. It's still creepy."

Miller pauses before continuing. "We see the light, coming from the stairwell. Ambrose says that's the reactor level, where the emergency generators are. He's ordering the others to stay here... I get my sidearm and follow him down. The light... here..." He stops. You realize he's sweating.

"You don't have to be nervous or afraid," Leandra says softly. "What happened then?" she asks asks curiously. She imagines she is at last starting to break into the truth. This is the most dangerous part, where Miller's concious mind confronts what it has buried so carefully.

Miller says, "Someone is talking to me... it's not Ambrose... it's a voice I don't recognize. I think... I think it's inside my own head... Ambrose... I'm asking him if he hears it too." He's still agitated. "The commander just told me to keep walking. He's got his sidearm drawn... so do I, I... think. It's darker at the end of the hall... wait, it's brightening..." He starts to breath heavily, not hyperventilating, but like a man trying hard to calm himself. "Who... are you..."

Miller continues to breath, a half a dozen breaths, and then he speaks again. "It's here... it's talking to me... I can't see anything, but I know it's here. It's shouting at me, it wants to know my name. Why does it want to know my name? ..." A rictus of pain passes across his face. "You're not getting it, damn you... yours first..."

Leandra listens calmly, watching Miller with care. "What does it do to you next?" she prompts gently, using the calm of her voice to try and give Miller more confidence as he faces his memories.

Miller's breathing slows. "It keeps asking, but I'm not telling. I know my name. My name is Miller. And it will never know that." He frowns. "It's irritating now. It won't shut up... but I still can't move. This place... looks so odd."

Miller's head rolls a bit from side to side. "The strobes have stopped. Nothing is moving. I'm not moving. There's someone else here... not ... it... not Schwarzgeist... someone else? Who is Schwarzgeist? Who are you? ... I don't know why my mouth won't move. I think I've been here a while."

Miller starts a bit in his chair. "I heard something... what was that? I thought I heard a noise... yes. I have to get moving... what happened to Ambrose? The light's gone, but... nobody is here. I'm in the... I think it's the reactor room. I can move again."

Leandra senses the hardest part is over. And that she's done enough on this first exploration. "And where do you go then?" she asks. She keeps herself very focused. She senses the danger may have passed for the moment, but sees this as very much touch-and-go yet.

Miller says, "It's telling me I have to go before Schwarzgeist comes back. It's telling me that I won't remember... that I can't remember if I want to survive." A few tears leak out of the harsh man's closed eyes. "It's telling me that the others... killed each other? Why? What happened to Ambrose?"

Miller continues, "I'm walking down the hall... the chronometer says... twelve hours? My suit shouldn't still be running... oh, no... Everyone here is gone... why was I spared? It isn't fair..."

Leandra sees the tear, and thinks this is far enough. Her voice is gentle as she speaks, "You no longer at the gate. You are safe and resting. When I count down from ten to one, you will slowly realize that you are in the isolation lab in Dromedary's Infirmary. Slowly you will feel refreshment and contentment flowing through your body." With that, Leandra begins her count, carefully guiding Miller back out of his hypnotic state.

Miller's eyes open, but he doesn't move. He isn't crying, but when he speaks, his voice is barely above a whisper. "Leave me alone."

Leandra rises and nods to Miller. "When you are ready to talk to me, please let me know. Your strength of will is amazing, and only that saved you, but I may be able to help you. I am at your disposal whenever you wish."

Miller gives only a single nod as Leandra leaves. Windzi hovers by the door for a moment, then just draws a curtain across the viewport and shuts the door. "He'll be alright, sooner or later. If you'll do me one more favor... since this wasn't recorded, we need two witnesses to convince the Council to re-instate his rank. You and me. I'd... prefer if we stuck to the facts."

Leandra looks to Windzi and taps her lip. "This interview revealed that he has a will that seemingly was greater than the others. He resisted. I suspect they did not do so well. If anything, he is more worthy of respect than previously thought. A return to work is just the thing to help him realize that."

Windzi gives an exasperated snort. "He's a stubborn and arrogant bastard." Her expression softens. "But he's ours. If it saved him once, it may save us again. Thank you, Leandra cal Maratain of Coulam."
