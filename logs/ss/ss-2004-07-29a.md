# Synthetic Saints 2004-07-29a

Half an hour later, the wardroom where Archer, Oi, Methusalah, and Minh have been playing poker has not changed. However, Jiro and Leandra have been summoned, since the wager Methusalah is proposing has gone beyond the realm of a simple game and into the realm of affecting the mission. The four astronauts from Ayer are gathered on one side of the same green felt card table, while Minh, somewhat nervously, seconds Methusalah on the other side. Methusalah himself shows no nervousness at all, and appears quite serious about the bet. He waits for the others to finish deliberations.

"Oh ho ho..." Oi leans in a little closer. "So now the game gets interesting." He takes the time to consider this. "So we're to wager against your information... hmmm, allow me to consult..." He turns to the assembled crew. "Well this is it. All comes down to the Game. We have to match his wager. But how? Maybe give them the tech to grow their own food? That'd be a good wager..."

Minh snorts. "We can grow our own food just fine. Of course, we have to eat vegetarian... you have cattle on Ayer?"

Methusalah raps the table once. "Minh. This is more serious than that. We're looking for a capital asset, kid. To whit, a starship of our own. Or at least the engines for one."

"Ahh." Oi considers. "The engines to a starship. Yeah. I can swing that I think." He turns to the others, "I mean if we have the spare parts, we can whip up anything. Although it won't matter too much. After all, we're going to win."

Archer shrugs. "Ships are ships, Methusaleh. Once the Gate is up and running, you can use any ship at all to make the jumps. The derelict that Sosa, Chang, and I explored would work fine for you once it's cleaned up."

A grin split's Methusalah's lined face like a cracking asteroid. "Hey, you are a fast one, Mister Collins. Yes. That's what I was thinking. But that old rust bucket will run a lot better with the high-tech antimatter-pulse engines you use in the Aurora... and we're years away from being able to make those ourselves. And it occurs to me that, thanks to your Doctor, we have our Commander back; thanks to you and Chang, we have a ship to stick him in; and thanks to you all, we'll soon have a stargate to fly him through. But if we want to be partners in your operation, instead of gas station attendants, we're going to need some serious engine power."

Archer leans back, thinking about that, and turns to the others. "And I think we could certainly offer that wager - our help and spare parts to re-activate that freighter for them?"

Methusalah nods vigorously, and you swear you can hear the bones in his neck creak. "Yes. The higher we bet, the more you provide to us; and if you win... well... the more I tell you. Things I'm sure it will take you a long time to find out on your own."

"Not to mention the know-how." Oi taps just above the forehead visor. "I do more than calculate odds in here y'know... so, unless there're any objections, sounds like we have ourselves a wager."

Leandra snorts. "You're both mad... you're wagering with the essence of survival here. If you need engines - Gods, if you need a _ship_ - you could just ask. And why would you _withhold_ information from us that might be the difference between life and death at the next star?" She looks over at Jiro. "I know I can't convince Oi, but surely you can see it!"

Archer shakes his head sadly. "Leandra... _you're_ the one that doesn't see it. A wager they can win or lose is honorable. Asking for charity just to speed up something they could eventually do themselves goes against the grain."

Methusalah holds up a hand. "Young lady... and I use that term with emphasis... it's my life, and I've lived it a long time. The things I've seen, and the wonders I've known... those moments belong to me. And you know what I've learned in two hundred years?" He pauses for dramatic import. "The only worthwhile human activity is exactly like one of two things - blackjack, or poker. Anything else can be done better by a computer." He shoots a long stare at Oi. "You have yet to learn that... yet to learn why we Play. You know, I think, that everyone does it, but you don't yet know why. You will learn, someday."

"Maybe that is true, maybe not." Oi regards Methuselah. "I know a little more about The Game than most. But then you're probably right, I still don't get it. So maybe, that's something else we'll have to wager on. A little later." Oi grins. "Or I'll learn myself."

Methusalah nods... "Well, then... if nobody has anything else... let us play."

The poker deck is passed to Archer. "You came out the worst of that last round," Methusalah says. "Go ahead and deal this one."

Archer shuffles, lets Methusaleh cut, and deals. "And so."

"The game begins." Oi nods as the cards are dealt.

The hand is played; betting is short, as the real stakes aren't dependant on them. Minh folds quickly. Archer has a pair of pairs; Oi manages to turn part of a flush into... a slightly larger part of a flush, and ends up losing to Methusalah's straight. Methusalah, oddly, doesn't seem very happy about winning.

"Well," he says, "The camels are getting a starship. Horray for them... and as for Ayer... well, come back when you can play, kid. And remember what I said about knowing why you play."

Oi places his cards down. "Well... I suppose it just wasn't in the cards." Oi nods, "Sch as it is. No shame in losing to the better Gamer though. Well-played." He leans back, "Well, looks like I'll have a bit of work to do, I think." He grins at Methuselah, "By the time I learn to play, you'll probably be all wasted away, geezer." He shakes his head. "Bah."

Methusalah wheels back from the table. "Heh... I don't think you'd be that lucky. See you around." He brings the lights up to a normal level as he leaves.

Jiro claps Oi on the shoulder as the round ends. "Good luck paying for what you just promised them," he says, calmly.

Oi nods to Jiro, "Yes, well luck will have nothing to do with it. Clearly it has nothing to do with this." He shakes his head, "Okay then. I'll get to work on the engines..."

Archer steeples his fingers and hmmms. "That could've gone ... differently. But regardless of the outcome of the wager, Jiro, this is good diplomacy here. We'll have them as partners, regardless, now. And I think Methusaleh will find a way to slip us the important part of what he was offering, sooner or later."

Minh speaks up at archer's comment. "He might. But it's part of his ethics; he can't give things away. He insists on the contest, he insists that things are won. He only resorts to charity as a last resort." He sips his water, and adds some ice and something that might be lemon juice. "I think he was disappointed that you didn't give him a chance to give it up, either."

Oi turns to Archer, "I don't think so. What would the point of wagering have been then? There'd be no risk, no real aspect of play to the Game. He's just better. For now. Someday I might be the best."

"This is, without a doubt, the biggest farce and fit of pure stupidity I have ever been subject to," says Leandra calmly. Too calmly. "If my superiors had informed me that I would have to deal with idiocy on this scale I would be back doing useful work and not wasting my time. I imagine now they won't even accept my resignation upon our return. Gambling! Next time lose yourself, instead."

Oi turns to Leandra, "You just... don't get it..." He taps on his vidglasses, bringing up the specs for the engines. "Well, don't leave without me. I'll be a while in getting the engines up to par."

Jiro simply turns and walks away, stone-faced. What he is thinking cannot be spoken here; it must be settled personally, privately, and that requires space and time to be found elsewhere.

"I get it very well. You do not need a doctor, you need a jester," says Leandra. "My hope is that when I file my report the Coulam decide to withdraw all support for this project and focus on good science, instead. That way, maybe I will not be utterly humiliated for the rest of my life."

Oi considers, "Oh. Well, and if I'd won? Imagine for a moment I'd had the winning hand and we were receiving knowledge unheard of for eons. Then where would we be?"

Oi says, "Then what tune would you be singing?"

"You do not understand. You lost the moment you picked up the cards," answers Leandra.

Minh walks out of the room quietly. "Looks like maybe you need some time to talk about this."

"Well, actually, I won a few hands..." explains Oi, "So, I don't think you're quite right."

Archer says, "We're not going to strip the engines out of the Aurora. We should be able to upgrade that old freighter's system using our spares."

---

It has been just six weeks since the Aurora jumped into the Crossroads system. Slowly, the Stargate has been restored to a semblance of working order. After the 'Exorcism' of the Stargate by the Aurora team, dozens of spacers from Dromedary have come to the gate to establish a foothold. Their first priority is to re-activate the fuel skimmers locked in the Gate's hangars. With the heavy cargo vehicles restored to operation, and the orbiting junk cleared from the Gate's vicinity, regular refuelling operations can begin.

Oi has been supervising the restoration of the Stargate's main function as faster-than-light travel device. Preliminary tests show that one of the reasons the Gate is so reluctant to function, is because a certain cosmological constant, referred to as 'gate permittivity', appears to be different in the XR system than the 55 Cancri system. Before the Crash, this would have caused a revolution in physics; permittivity was previously measured to be a constant to twelve decimal places at every star humanity ever visited. Now, a hundred years after the Crash, it just adds one more item to the mystery.

Even with the skimmer fleet operating in reduced capacity, enough fuel has been gathered to fire the gate for several jumps. Message canisters are passed back and forth with 55 Cancri, who send recorded congratulations to the Aurora team from MacArthur, Strang, Greyrobe, and Takeda, among others. Finally the day arrives for the Aurora and her crew to make the return jump to 55 Cancri. They have gathered in a conference room on the Gate Control building, across the street from the Embassy, for a last telepresence engagement with the Council of Dromedary.

Windzi sits in the center seat. All six of the other Council members, including Miller and Methusalah, are in their usual seats. Miller looks sullen, but doesn't seem to be grinding his teeth this time. "Well, my friends. So it would seem that you're heading home to report? I'm sure you'll be back. In the meantime... we'll work on calibrating the Gate for a jump to New Queensland." She glances across at Methusalah. "I would hope that you'll consider our diplomatic exchange equitable, and we look forward to greeting your next emissaries."

Jiro bows politely, smiling as he rises up again. "This has been a good sign for our exploratory program," he replies. "It's been a pleasure to be here, to see strength and determination from our fellow man beyond the gates. You've aided us in everything, and even bested us a few times." He nods politely in the elder councilor's direction in mute recognition. "We're glad to have you as friends."

Once again, the Aurora team gathers in the 'storm cellar', with Archer in the forward bridge. The wedge-shaped starship detaches from the XR stargate and drifts to the center of the ring. The Dromedary controller makes the countdown... "Good luck, Aurora-1, and don't be a stranger... jump in five... four... three... two... one..." And then the strange silence.

Archer feels the same eerie sense of observation that he did before... a moment, frozen in time, with nothing outside the viewport except inky blackness. He can't move... but strangely doesn't feel paralyzed or restrained. He knows, without moving, that a giant eye is watching him, just over his shoulder.

And this time, he's not the only one. Jiro, seated six meters behind him, is conscious of an extension of time during the normally-instantaneous gate jump. Although the feeling of observation isn't nearly so intense, the prolonged moment is as unexpected as it is inexplicable.

All that the cleric is can be found, crystallizing together in those few brief seconds. The basis of his faith, his beliefs about the Aeons, and his general feeling of auspicious prospects for the mission come together in a brief prayer. _Continue to watch over us._

Archer speaks to the Presence. "And here we are again. Who are you? _What_ are you? What do you want?" He chuckles. "Who's winning the Game?"

Archer's words don't come through his lips, but the thoughts do cross his mind. It's unclear if anyone hears; a moment late, with a sensation like the blinking of an eye, the universe winks back into existence outside the viewport... and the unmistakable shape of the 55 Cancri stargate is spinning several kilometers ahead of you.

The radio crackles into life a few moments later, cutting through the odd radiation that accompanies a gate jump. "Aurora, we have you on visual, can you hear us? Please report medical and operational status..." The message repeats several times.

Archer responds as soon as he gets over the odd distorted feeling of the Jump, keying the microphone. "This is Aurora. We're fine, physically... no alarm lights on the board after the jump. Requesting permission to dock."

Strang comes onto the radio. "Aurora, permission granted, please expedite docking... as you might expect we're eager to get your report."

The docking goes smoothly, and in a half an hour, the Aurora is once again moored in a drydock back in the outer ring of the Stargate. Strang meets you at the airlock... save the span of six weeks, it's exactly the same scene as when you departed.

Briefly Jiro experiences a flash of _deja vu_, recalling his own experiences on the other Gate. Nevertheless it doesn't hinder him. "Glad to be back," he says with a smile. "It gave me.. a new perspective, I'll say."

Strang smiles a toothy grin. "So... you made it. And you found survivors there! We've been swapping data pods for two weeks. MacArthur wants to speak to you. We're too far out for a teleconference, but we'll put your reports on the high-power transciever as soon as we can download them.

Strang leads the way back to the main concourse. "So... what do you have to say for flipping through more than two parsecs in two months? This project going to work?"

"Every gate will lead somewhere different, I feel," replies Jiro thoughtfully. "But, the Aeons are watching over us. I don't expect you to believe me or what I think, but there was an experience coming back that convinced me we're doing the right thing. We just need to be adequately prepared."

Archer twitches an eyebrow at that. He'd asked before, and no one else had noticed. He makes a mental note to have a long, private discussion with Jiro as soon as possible. "They'll be fine associates in this endeavor, even if we did have to make a ... somewhat unorthdox grant of aid."

"Unorthodox?" she asks, as you board the tram to the Embassy. "What did you have to promise them, a herd of heifers?"

"Er..." Oi chuckles, "Nah nothing as valuble as all that. Just some anti-matter pulse engines. That's all."

Strang turns slowly, dumbstruck, as the street slides past. "Engines? Like, from an Aurora-class vehicle? Oh, jeez. Those are damn hard to come by... how many?"

Leandra, through just about everything since preparations to return to Ayer have really been made, has been remarkably quiet. Her outburst perhaps drained her of any further desire to comment. She reflects inwardly how curious it is that she's not all interested in making her report to the Coulam.

Archer says, "They want to be partners, not lackeys. We promised them we'd help them refurbish an old derelict freighter up to our standards. The ship's in good shape, just needs modern engines."

"Since they are going to be important to the maintenance of the Crossroads Gate, it seems like a wise investment anyway," puts in Jiro. "I think there are some on the team who question the method by which the deal was brokered, but I don't dispute that they need something like an engine one way or another."

Strang sighs. "Well. It could be worse. Parts we can spare... entire engines might be harder. MacArther will have some convincing to do. And if it gets the gate operating more reliably, then maybe it's a cheap deal."
