# Synthetic Saints 2004-08-05

The Aurora Team is spending a week on the 55 Cancri startgate while Aurora-1 is in refit. Since the previous excursion was shorter than expected, the refit process takes little time - fresh comestibles are loaded, and tech crews run diagnostics on the ship's systems. The antimatter canisters are replenished. The crews also make adjustments to the Aurora-2, which is being prepared in the adjacent berth for Q'in Gatta Sammy and his crew.

Messages are exchanged with the governments on Ayer, including the 'request' for antimatter engines for Dromedary's salvaged ship. The diplomats overseeing the Aurora mission balk at the cost, at first; but over the next few days, MacArthur persuades them to agree to send personnel and parts to Crossroads. The substitution of manpower for finished devices will delay delivery, but is more acceptable to all involved.

Leandra's report to her people is a long and detailed one. Surprising so, considering how little really happened on the mission. Due to what Leandra cites as numerous failures in the handling of events and the inability to foresee the rather obvious lack of care in the matter of technology and information exchange, she also offers her resignation, should the council deem it fitting to remove her from the task. Even as she files it, she is not sure which would shame her more: to be ordered to step down, or to continue, knowing what has happened.

Leandra's answer comes in the form of video-mail from Vedus Greyrobe, in his capacity as the intercessor for the Aurora project. Greyrobe delivers the response from a desk in front of a broad bay window that must be near the dock, because the verdant landscape of the Coulamite colony stretches to the distance behind him. "Leandra... the Council sees no need to accept your resignation at this time. I need say no more than that; however... I do want to make mention of something."

Greyrobe gestures, and a map of New Queensland appears. It zooms in on a teardrop shaped island in the sub-polar regions south of the eastern continent. "This is the Island of Tasmania... not to be confused with the island of the same name on Earth. It was home to a large branch of our people on New Queensland. One of our reasons for backing this mission is to re-contact them. Now... you're concerned about the status of the mission, but you do not express it as fear; which is to your credit. Therefore, we'd like you to make contact with the Coluam on New Queensland. When you return, if you still wish it, we can discuss your re-assignment then."

Meanwhile, Jiro speaks briefly with Strang, aboard the Gate, about Aurora-1 and the upcoming mission to New Queensland. He repeats for her the arguments he's made to his superiors via video, citing in particular concerns about detection while in space and in orbit.

Strang taps at the top of an archaic, ugly steel workbench. "The possibility of encounters with hostile automation seems to increase with all the intelligence we receive... and so I see what you're asking for. This could be tricky. The Aurora wasn't built for stealth. But perhaps we can work something out."

With the refit complete, MacArthur delivers a final briefing via video mail. "Your mission at New Queensland, is essentially the same as your mission in the Crossroads system. In light of the information that you have brought back, it seems certain that you will encounter remnants of hostile AI. You should be aware that New Queensland had a much higher level of technology; in the hands of hostile AI, that technology will be correspondingly more dangerous. So our only modification to your mission description is... if you encounter resistance, find somewhere safe to establish a beach-head. Captain Sammy will be following you in the Aurora 2 in eight weeks. The two teams together will make the decision to re-open New Queensland, or to retreat to 55 Cancri using hibernation equipment."

With the Aurora's refit complete, the team once again boards through the docking port. Strang is there to see you off; the holographs on the wall show your ship. The swarm of technicians have moved away and are working on the Aurora-2. Once again, Strang seems pensive.

"The mystery just keeps deepening," she begins. "The Sleepers, including Halunen, remain comatose. And you've encountered remnants of hostile AI in Crossroads as well. I do hope we will see each other again soon, my friends." She pauses. "One other thing, Jiro. We pulled some ECM pods out of the wreckage of the Woomera, which had been parked not far from here. Oi will find a briefing on his console. It's the closest we can come to stealth. Just be warned - masking yourself is no substitute for remaining undetected in the first place."

"That's why I asked for a gate-entry that would mask our presence as much as possible, and why I want to run dark," replies Jiro. "I'm assuming the worst. I'd rather be pleasantly surprised than just surprised."

Leandra remains rather quiet, considering what she was told by Greyrobe with care. She wonders if the Coulam will still be there now. And if they are, will they still be like her own people.

Strang grins. "We've plotted a course and a gate entry that should allow you to arrive with Delta Cancri 8 - that's a gas giant - between you and New Queensland. You can make a quiet approach that will get you into orbit in three weeks, and you won't have to run your reactors hot to get there. Someone may see the fallout from the jump, but they probably won't see you coming."

The jump to Crossroads is less eventful than the previous two. Nobody has the strange feeling of observation this time, not even Archer. In the intervening week, much has changed aboard the Crossroads stargate. The derilect light freighter has been brought into spacedock by skimmer-tugs. Bright lights show through the hull where technical crews operate welders and construction equipment. The gate itself is operated by a skeleton crew, and rotates much more slowly than before - enough to provide a simulation of 0.2G. Dromedarians walk carefully through the unfamiliar gravity, several of them panting with the effort.

The jump from Crossroads is more tense than the jump from 55 Cancri. Bo Minh has taken up the impromptu role of Gate Controller. The crew aboard the Stargate is a mixture of volunteers from Ayer and colonists from Dromedary, and so the radio carries a curious mixture of Australite and Camel accents. The stargate has been programmed to deliver the Aurora so that a gas giant masks their neutrino fallout from New Queensland itself; the same gas giant has a stargate orbiting at its trailing trojan point, much like Crossroads. It will be up to the team to decide whether the gate or the planet will be the first destination.

Whatever the team decides, Jiro lays out his conclusions, post-jump. "A-life so far has been principally hostile to humanity. New Queensland was more advanced; that to me means likelier that whatever technology is on the planet has been compromised. The planet will be the biggest potential threat; anything aboard the gate, the second biggest. Before we do anything else, I want us to run as dark as we can, and do signal analysis on radio traffic in-system. That should at least give us a clue on conditions."

"The section of the planet most immune to any infection would be the Coulam settlement," suggests Leandra. "If any place would not be struck by a computer virus, it would be there. We do not allow our main systems to interact with the rest of the world for that very purpose."

"Well... yeah. You make a good point..." Oi is inclined to agree with the idea about encountering more A-life. "So... more dealings with the Crash hmmm?"

"That, and the coastlines, are where I would expect to find human survivors, but I am not the expert," replies Jiro calmly. "A search for habitation using our telescopes should be a priority."

Archer nods to Oi. "More than likely. I quite agree... we run as dark as we can, and use passive systems only for now."

"You know, it might be possible to take one of the Rampant things, and see if we can't engineer the Crash somehow to get it into a state of Transcendance. Wouldn't that be a neat trick." Oi considers this, then sort of backs down, "Although, I guess, not really all that practical. Nevermind."

Jiro explains a bit more: "So far the a-life we've seen really hasn't innovated. It uses existing computers, existing drones and other systems. We have few data-points, admittedly. Records indicated a 'backdoor system' on New Queensland technology. If such failsafes are still intact, that may serve as a defense against compromised drones, sensors, or weapons. I leave it to Oi to investigate that if we have opportunity."

Archer says, "I don't suppose the records actually _gave_ any backdoor codes, did they?"

The cleric shakes his head. "I don't think so. But if we pursue that as a project, we should have the relevant records in our databanks."

"Who needs backdoor codes when you've got me on your team?" Oi grins, then considers, "Well... I guess the backdoor codes are a little more uhm, yeah... we can find those."

The Aurora is orbiting behind Delta Cancri 6, a gas giant striped with multicolored bands . So far... all is quiet. There are many radio sources, but all natural, including the planet itself, which is a bright radio source... and neutrino sink. The jump should go undetected by anyone in a closer orbit.

Over the next four hours, the team collects passive radio and telescope data from all over the Delta Cancri system. The computer predicts the location of many smaller deep space habitats. They are visible as bright reflections in the telescopes... but there seems to be no radio activity. In addition, a good fraction of the smaller habitates are gone - either destroyed, or moved.

Radio traffic from New Queensland itself is minimal - almost undetectable. Commercial traffic is entirely absent. The only signals that Jiro and Oi are able to locate are heavily-encrypted communications in a microwave band typically used for remote control of unmanned deep space probes.

Archer says, "And that is troubling. It hasn't been long enough to expect a lot of natural losses in deep-space habitats. We're seeing either internal or external attacks, or deliberate move-and-hide operations."

"It seems that wherever you find a lot of humans conflict is likely," Leandra says quietly. "The question is, how do interact without getting involved by accident? Or more directly, what do we do next. They are pretty quiet, it seems."

Archer says, "And we seem to have done this right. We came out exactly as hoped, and we're not in line of sight to anything that should have been able to pick us up."

A plot of twenty-seven seperate objects in distant orbits appears in a hologram near Jiro's console. Most are near planest or large asteroids; the rest appear to be following transfer orbits between these points.

Most of the objects are too distant for Aurora's telescope to get an accurate image. What can be learned is that the objects are metallic and highly reflective; if they are artificial, they probably mass about 100 tons. Each is followed by a distinct, actinic blue spike indicative of a high-power ion drive or magnetic sail.

Oi hmms, "Huh. You know, if I had to make a guess here, which I may very well have to do, knowing you lot, these ships are a dead ringer for the old tax enforcement fleet."

Oi says, "Uhm, the important thing to mention here, is that the fleet are largely automated. So uhm... they could all be bonkers or running amok, or something..."

"That means we need to address the issue of New Queensland," concludes Jiro. "I don't think we can restore any of the gates without being noticed and presumably interfered with."

Archer is looking something up in his personal files. "If those are the Tax Enforcement Fleet ships... D'you all remember what those things were? They were supposed to scan, inspect, and levy duties on all arriving ships. If the little blighters are still active, and they spot us..."

Jiro nods his agreement. "We're not equipped to disable that fleet," he concludes. "At least not without further study."

Archer says, "Thing is, they were all automated. They either avoided the Crash, or they are still working AI's."

Archer says, "We're safe enough here; arriving at the gas giant masked us, and they won't be able to see our radar signature against its backdrop unless they're already up close and personal. But if we move away, that could be problematic."

Jiro thinks carefully for awhile. "Knowing what they are doing seems like an important task," he concludes. "If they haven't been compromised, we're relatively free to operate in the system. If they have been, it's valuable intelligence to know what they're being tasked to do."

Archer says, "So we sit tight for a day or three and watch them. Let's see if we notice any patterns."

Jiro nods. "And we try to decode that microwave-band traffic."

Oi nods, "Sounds like a fine plan to me..."

In the next 24 hours, the Aurora makes a full orbit of the gas giant. During the transit of the light side, New Queensland becomes visible on the telescope. The image of the blue-green world is much the same as it does in library data... from which Leandra can conclude that the biosphere, at least is intact. Sunlight glints off of the cloud of space-junk in orbit. Higher resolution images show that the outlines of the continents are intact; there are no new craters (at least not ones large enough to be seen from this distance).

"As near as I can tell, the power plants are not operable," announces Leandra. "The temperature isn't high enough for it. Unless of course they decided to mask such use for a reason I have yet to understand. For now, evidence indicates that they have no power plants, and so the quality of life there is dubious, at best."

Archer says, "You can mask a power plant's location. The heat still has to go somewhere. This could be boding better..."

Archer and Jiro continue their observations of the fleet, detecting signals from another 32 patrol craft... apparently those are all of them. The craft reach particular areas, loiter for several hours, and then begin a burn for another waypoint. The prelimary plots of the patrol routes are quite different from the traditional routes used by the Fleet before the crash; in particular, they cover many of the smaller outposts that probably would have been ignored before.

Still, the sensors detect no radio emissions apart from those of the tax fleet. Oi is hunched over his console, attempting to crack the encryption. The protocol is quite advanced, and it seems that the relays are using quantum encryption to exchange keys... and so the task is made much more difficult.

Archer says, "Just fifty-nine of them? That's down quite a bit. Even allowing for some on the far side of the primary, that's less than two-thirds of the original fleet. Maybe they still are operating under the old programming."

Jiro studies the display. "Is it possible that they are only partially compromised?" he asks, sounding uncertain. "That their sensors are being used for something, but their navigation systems are intact?"

Archer says, "It's _possible._ Or they may just be using the old search protocols because they're good ones, and be under command of a rampant AI now."

Archer says, "The question is, do we want to risk moving, or just sit here until Two arrives?"

"That's an important distinction," concludes Jiro. "If they constitute the bulk of the a-life fleet - if there even is one - then we can work on the gate whether or not they detect us, as long as they can't move. If they CAN move, or if they can ship something else toward the Gate, the game is up."

Archer says, "So, do we try to sneak over to the Gate when they're elsewhere?"

Jiro nods. "I think the second smaller gate can be a good base of operations, if we can find a way to hide Aurora-1 from detection. If we aren't detected, we can do everything but load up the necessary gasses for a gate-jump."

"Does the other ship have any better weapon systems?" asks Leandra. "If not, waiting seems unhelpful to me. We'd just have twice as many targets."

After studying the situation a little more, and conferring with the others, Jiro lays out what he thinks is the best next step: approach the 'further' small gate, perform an EVA to sever the leads on any communication antennae on the Gate to block a warning signal, then dock and begin repairing the Gate itself. All that the team will have to delay is gas-skimming, and the repairs will give time to gather more data from the system.
