# Synthetic Saints 2004-09-02

Now that the Gate has been temporarily left behind, and the singular encounter with 'Aurora' is finished, the team begins a furious study. Nagging feelings of doubt have crystallized into clearly actionable items with the portentious conversation the team engaged in. The team's online knowledge-base, which forms the core of Jiro's written reports and acts as a sink for raw data from the ship's sensors, crew logs, and other things, is re-opened and re-examined. Particular attention is paid to Oi's thoroughly-used portable computer. And everybody presents their analyses and conclusions.

Oi begins with the dataset that Aurora interfaced with. Aside from the need to re-set the operating system into a stable configuration, the machine is intact - a fact Jiro finds remarkable. Further, new information seems to have actually been added to it. The files detail, in an inhumanly precise and Spartan fashion, the low-level interface mechanisms the crystal entity's 'brain' uses. In human terms, if the crystals and conduits were a human brain, the electrochemical signals and neurons it would use are now revealed. The higher-level functions remain the team's to decipher.

Leandra is next. Based on her hypnotherapy session and her former reading, she has an idea about the identities of 'TAC' - Theophrastus Albert Cohen, a polymath scientist of the 22nd century - and 'SG' - Schwarzgeist, a name Commander Miller of the Dromedary colony said in passing. 'GH' presumably referred to Galil Halunen, the only other occupant of the Icereach Station at the time. Cohen supposedly dabbled in faster-than-light travel and "other dimensions", and the connection between his initials and current events seems more than coincidental. The significance of "Schwarzgeist" remains unclear at this time, though its translation according to the ship's library - "Black Ghost" - is uncomfortably suggestive in light of the computer-based entities the team's encountered.

Jiro, the soldier, brings up something heard at the Dromedary Gate - "this is not the only battlefield" and something Aurora said - "the luminal entity fears \[the Shining One\], for it won victory by the barest margin". On Icereach, in the Crossroads Gate, and here, there has always been a friendly force and a hostile one, and the hostile one has never (apparently) attempted communication. Either it is unable to do so (and though Aurora "spoke" with it, Aurora also easily mastered the team's own setup), or it is unwilling to. And he adds one other thing. "We cannot simply keep calling poorly-understood things 'them' and 'the other' and 'the entities'. Provisionally, I believe the beings similar to Aurora are cognate with the 'Aeons' of Exile theology and I will refer to them as such. I don't expect you to as well, of course."

Archer is more concerned with keeping the Aurora undetected by the Revenue Fleet, and sets up the sensor cameras to watch for sudden changes in brightness; light-speed delays will cause sudden dimming of the objects in the system for some time as the wave-front reaches the Aurora after reflecting from planets, asteroids... and ships. "Aeons is fine. We have to call them something, after all. We need to send out probes."

In the wake of the giant EMP at the Delta Cancri 8 gate, the Revenue Fleet appears to be preoccupied. No less than fifteen spacecraft divert from their routes and fly to the derilect stargate, leaving much of the inner solar system unpatrolled. The crew takes advantage of the distraction to move into the asteroid belt between Delta Cancri 8 and New Queensland.

Once the ship is in safely in motion, drifting quietly through the system on minimal power, Archer starts a rapid photographic survey of the system. "When the sun dimmed, everything out there that reflects sunlight blinked as well. That event will make local objects obvious, and by the geometry of the situation, the closer they are the quicker we'll see the blink. If we've missed any ships, that'll be the way to spot 'em." Once that is underway, he begins modifying the exploratory drones into a stealthy spy-satellite network. "We need to find out if we can crack the Crystal Entity's communications with the hints that Aurora gave you, Oi, and to do that we need to tap their comms. Even if we can't, signal analysis ought to be able to tell us if there are any other nodes that we don't know about." He also keeps a close eye on the Revenue Fleet ships that have already been identified.

During the 11-day voyage, the crew busies themselves with preparing unmanned probes. The computers contain a large library of service spacecraft; after 800 years in space, there's hundreds of off-the-shelf designs available at the touch of a button. The limited factory facilities aboard the Aurora can easily handle a number of 21st century plans, some bearing the markings of such venerable institutes as 'JPL' and 'Energia'. The final product is quarter-ton cone-shaped probe festooned with solar panels and a pair of manipulator arms. The factory has sufficient parts for four such craft.

The drones are launched from the Aurora as they are completed, heading for the largest nearby hulks and derilects, ones that have had contact with the Revenue Fleet. The final one is dispatched to the Tango Hotel, a deep-space transfer station hollowed out of an iron asteroid. The Tango Hotel is a short distance from Aurora's intended hiding place in the DC7 belt.

In between working shifts, the crew has many long discussions in the ship's wardroom, analyzing the clues that they have thus far found. Many of the answers only breed more questions. If the Shining One and Schwarzgeist were in conflict, who won? Where is the Shining One now? What is Schwarzgeist? The team's concensus is that, whatever else is going on, it's important to make contact with the crystalline 'viral brains' that were infesting the DC8 gate, and learn their purpose.

Fortunately, Oi uses the information left by the hyperspace entity to construct an interface module for the viral brain. The module is similar in construction to the viral brain itself - a chunk of amorphous quartz prepared by nano-assemblers in Aurora's factory. The single module theoretically has more computing power than all the other processors on the ship combined. Oi completes the device with a personality simulator that will put an anthropomorphic illusion on top of the odd signals; if all goes well, it might be possible to 'talk' to the next viral brain the team encounters.

At last, the Aurora arrives in the Delta Cancri 7 asteroid belt. Delta Cancri itself is more of a major asteroid, a Mercury-size ball of iron and carbon that is half an AU ahead of the team's current position. The rest of the orbital position is occupied by sparse collections of asteroid junk, ranging in size from clouds of pebbles to big rocks weighing more than ten thousand tons. The belt is hardly the active meat-grinder of science fiction stories, but it provides adequate cover from prying eyes... or prying sensors.

The ship settles in near a small cluster of comet cores, and the crew uses the long-range telescopes on the Aurora to inspect New Queensland. There's more detail visible here than there was at the gas giant or the stargate, but high-resolution data is still elusive. The thermographic profile of the planet shows irregular radiation patterns consistent with the dimming and brightening of the system's star. From this range, however, one thing is readily apparent - the city lights that would usually light up the dark side of the planet at night, are absent everywhere except the location of New Perth; and the outline of the illuminated area, while similar to the outline shown in the century-old atlas, shows quite a bit of difference. A disc-shaped chunk in the center is totally dark. Some lights head upstream along a river that runs through the city.

Archer points to the image of New Perth. "Something hit it. Either a bolide, or a nuke. Half a megatonne level, at a first estimate."

"Yeah... somethin' hit it. What was yer first clue?" Oi chuckles. "So, uhm, I guess we're goin' down there..."

The results from the transfer station probe come through as soon as it is in range of the old asteroid. A cluster of quartz pillars on the surface, approximately half a meter tall, are putting out the same kind of radio traffic as they did on the Delta Cancri 8 gate. Over the next hour, it detects three more such clusters, arranged in a roughly tetrahedral form on the surface of the asteroid. Also, it detects magnetic anomolies that can only mean that at least one large fusion reactor is operating inside the rock.

"It seems this may be a good spot to begin our experiments," says Jiro, indicating the transfer station on the display as he studies the readouts from the bots. "Sending something to orbit New Queensland for the close-in survey we need will take time." He confers with Leandra and Oi for a few minutes, then continues. "Okay. If the interface rig we have can monitor radio communications, this is one more important source of data. We can park Aurora nearby, build and deploy a second interface module right near the antennas, then go inside and start our experiments. Opinions?"

Archer says, "Should work. Though we might want to monitor for a day or so before we go in."

Jiro nods. "Of course."

"With some effort, we should be able to learn just how this entity functions," suggests Leandra. "I'd like to have as complete a picture as possible. We might start to see how the mind processes the stimuli it receives, but we need to gather a great deal of data to achieve this." In other words, she thinks this could take a lot of time.

Archer says, "We'll do what we can before the second ship arrives. But we need to see about survivors on New Queensland, too."

"Making friendly contact with the crystal entity might help with that," says Jiro. "But I find it likelier that we'll find them via survey or deduction. Still, rushing in won't help them any more than it will us."

Archer makes clever use of available cover - which is a hard thing to do in space, where you're either totally obscured, or out in the open for all to see, and no matter what angle you have covered, there's many more where there's no cover at all. It's impossible to avoid 100% of the sensor scans, and Aurora is painted by low-power radar on the Tango Hotel several times. It's unclear if anyone or anything on board reacts to the movement.

Archer says, "It's hard to be sure if we were above their detection threshold. Nothing locked in and tried to follow us, though."

The closest Archer is able to approach with the Aurora is behind an orbiting iceberg nearly a hundred thousand kilometers from the transfer point. Any closer, and there won't be enough cover to hide the big refitted fuel skimmer.

Archer nudges the shuttle into a quiet orbit toward the rear of the planetoid. His usual singing is in a minor key today. "Something's not right. I'm not sure what."

Jiro nods slowly. "We can't act on just a hunch," he says in a quiet voice. "But I'll keep my eyes out.."

The chunk of ice isn't big enough to have a significant gravity field of its own, so there's an unavoidable few moments where the shuttle must be exposed and powered while it makes a short burn to get it moving towards the transfer station. Everyone is watching the instruments, and everyone is sure that, if there are sensors pointed your way, they're easily able to see you coming. After the burn, Archer powers down nearly everything on the shuttle, and all is eerily quiet - the only audible sound is, literally, the breathing of the crew, and the sound of one small fan in the backup rebreather.

Archer says, "_You_ may not want to act on a hunch, but I've made a career of it. Something is definitely off. I don't think it's disastrous, but it's definitely nasty."

Archer says, "I think it knows we're here, and is baiting us in. Keep your eyes open and your weapons primed."

"You really think it knows?" asks Leandra, looking at Archer closely. "If so, we'll have to try and surprise it in some other way. As long as it can't see our every movement, it should be possible."

"Aurora told us the 'master node' had been told of our existence. Presumably it could have alerted other nodes," theorizes Jiro. "This site may not expect us specifically, though it may be ready."

Archer says, "And if they're alerted somehow, we'll run afoul of general preparations but not a specific response aimed at us. Be prepared for anything."

While the shuttle drifts towards the transfer station over the next two hours, Oi remotely programs the original drone, sent days before, to monitor the power distribution inside the station. It's easy enough to bring the drone onto the surface, and to find an intact communications port. The manipulators efficiently pry off the protective housing and insert probes and sensors into the network hardware inside.

Applying meaning to the data it obtains, however, is harder to do. It seems that the sensors are a minor draw on the station's power core; most of the power is going... somewhere else. Something inside the station, that isn't recorded in the original plans. The good news is that it's not going into hostile drones; the bad news is, there's no telling where else it's ending up.

"Well, by making a great deal of assumptions, I would say that the entity here is going to have a mess of a few tons. Surely no more than ten tons, unless it has found yet another fuel source to charge its growth," says Leandra. "But this brings up an interesting point. Considering the conditions we've seen here and elsewhere, I have to wonder just what tells each node how large it should become."

Archer says, "Probably controlled by the central node, I'd think. It grows them big enough to handle whatever local autonomous functions are needed."

"But if there is a central node, where will it be.. and what will supply all the power it would require?" asks Leandra. "Perhaps one of these dominates an entire planet."

Archer says, "I hope not, but I fear it's possible."

Leandra thinks for a while, "Or perhaps something far larger than a planet, something that provides almost unlimited energy. The stars themselves. It reminds me of a few papers I read on Matrioshka Brains. They were to be computers so large they could only be powered by stars. Naturally only hypothetical, if you would even call them that."

Jiro smiles faintly. "With Aurora feeding off the system star, and demonstrating what it demonstrated, I wouldn't call them hypothetical. I would call them the Aeons."

Archer chuckles. "That's pre-supposing your beliefs are accurate, of course. Be prepared to adjust them as we get more data."

From an altitude of 30 nautical miles, the Tango Hotel isn't much to look at - a mottled red and grey lump of iron and granite, a slightly flattened spehere about 700 kilometers across. One exceptional feature is the crystal columns detected by the probe. From this distance, even the smaller telescopes on the Walkabout can detect the sharp edges of the slabs of quartz, and the sporadic, faint purple glows that swim within the translucent monoliths.

The Walkabout is still dark and silent, but no missles, lasers, or ravening space monsters leap from the recessed hangers on the surface of the rock to tear you bulkhead from bulkhead.

Archer waits as long as possible in quiet mode, then brakes and lands the shuttle just a little way from their target, in a small crater out of line-of-sight to the access they plan to use. The landing jets kick up dust from the surface which arcs high but falls rapidly again in the absence of air.

Armored and armed, and carrying an interface module the team developed in all-purpose utility webbing, Jiro cycles the airlock and carefully touches down on the surface. Walking carefully, he approaches the meter-high pillars that seem to be acting as relay points for the 'brain' that's lurking here. With Oi's guidance he wraps the device around the base of the pillar, and fiddling with a it a bit before creeping carefully back.

Oi gets a signal almost immediately. The personality simulator comes on-line and shows a representation of the transmitting entity as an image on the monitor. Like Viktor, the hologram is about 20 cm high and humanoid - and there the resembelance ends. The surface features of the figure shift rapidly, as if its skin is made of billowing black silk. Within a minute, the approximation algorithms inside the simulator adopt this metaphor and render it as a cloaked and hooded figure, wearing dark, rippling cloth. It turns in the center of the display, waving its arms as if conducting an unseen orchestra. The simulated figure does not act like it notices your presence... but there's no way of knowing if you are worthy of its full attention, or just a minor stanza in its mysterious, silent symphony.

Archer comes back through the airlock to see the silent conductor in the simulator hologram. "Now that is just spooky."

"This is the external feed," says Jiro. "To get better results, we'll still want to get inside, I think, and find whatever else might be waiting."

Archer says, "Eh. Want is perhaps not the right word. 'Need' works."
