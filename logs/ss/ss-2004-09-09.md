# Synthetic Saints 2004-09-09

The Aurora Team is parked on the surface of the asteroid known as Tango Hotel, near a crystalline pylon identical to those found on the Delta Cancri 8 stargate. Jiro has just returned from planting a remote sensor, built from designs left behind in Oi's dataset by the hyperspace entity that called itself 'Aurora'.

The personality simulator is already able to interpret the coarse form of the entity inhabiting the pylons. Although the specifics are still lacking, the holodisplay shows a dark figure, cloaked in shimmering black rainments. The figure twists and gestures as if conducting a macabre rendition of a Wagnerian sympony.

With the team's knowledge base, "SG" was revealed as "Schwarzgeist" - possibly. The word translated into "Black Ghost" in Aurora's linguistic library, and this is the thought on Jiro's mind as he speaks. "If this is 'Schwarzgeist', this is too much for me to be comfortable with coincidence. I wonder if whoever assigned that name was looking at the same personality-simulation data as us?"

Archer is humming 'Danse Macabre' to himself as he watches the simulator. "If he wasn't, it's too spooky for words. Do we want to go inside, or do we go back to Aurora and head toward New Queensland?"

Oi prods at a console. "I'm not sure where it's getting its ideas from. If I read this right, this means that whatever is here, on this rock, is doing some heavy number-crunching. But it's more than that, it's also trying to work in data from other sources. That's the part where it's acting like a conductor."

"Could that computation be related to the recent event?" asks Jiro. He need not specify which one. "I'm thinking we're safer for the moment here, and if there is also apparently danger waiting for us inside, how much more near the planet itself?"

Archer says, "Aurora said there were still humans on the planet. Of course, we may have stirred things up a bit."

Oi hammers away for a few more minutes, before saying "Yeah.... yeah, this part here, that matches some of our own data on the spread of the EMP... and this part, if this is seconds... is precisely the interval that the sun dimmed..." He trails off, one hand absently tapping the keypad.

Leandra considers what Oi says and nods. "So all this activity is due to the appearance of Aurora. I wonder what it will make of us, though. I don't wonder enough to risk finding out yet, but if we are going to claim this system, we'll have to deal with the crystal entity sooner or later."

Jiro taps his chin thoughtfully. "The thing must know we're here if it's prepared a cold reception. Now that we're here, we may as well try some sort of first-contact protocol through the rig we have." He gestures at the black-cloaked thing visible on the display.

Archer says, "That would certainly get its attention. Do we want to do that so soon?"

Oi shows the data to Leandra. "I think this is data from a lot of different observations. It must be, I'm not wrong about stuff like that. But... umm... it's hard to tell precisely where. It's all telemetry, and astrophysics, and... things. I'd guess a lot of it is from the other blips we found, other hulks, the Revenue fleet, the Stargates." He pauses. "Oh, and New Queensland. Probably."

"The longer we delay, the longer it can plan," says Jiro. "Communication is a logical step once the element of surprise is lost, which based on what you say must be true."

"We can't really do much but experiment, then," says Leandra. "Is there any way you can give me a little more precision concerning just what data this entity is processing? It might be important. I'd like to know if it has been watching us," says Leandra. "Perhaps we could do some analysis using the coordinates our ship has travelled through and see if it's paid attention to those areas?"

Oi nods, absently. "Well. I don't think I've done anything to alert it to our presence... here, this may be helpful." A window opens in the hologram, showing a wireframe map of the Tango Hotel outpost. It's a kidney-shaped three-level habitat dug into the side of a crater near the north pole of the planet; the base of the crater has several landing pads, fuel tanks, and enclosures that serve as hangers. "Bottom level is engineering. Middle level is crew facilities. Top level is... umm... a greenhouse, I think. And a rugby field." He blinks. "In low-gee. What a concept."

Leandra considers for a time, looking at the immense amount of data that Oi is picking up. "The computational power of this node is incredible. We can't really tell just what it is and is not interested in. Save for one certainty. It's very interested in what happened with Aurora. As for us, it is beyond my knowledge to say. We may be a passing interest. Perhaps we are no threat?"

Archer says, "Perhaps it hasn't connected us to the Event yet, or doesn't realize we're important to it."

Oi touches a part of the display. "Hey, this is odd..." As he speaks, the crystal pylon outside glows a bright purple. The figure on the screen stops its dance and points to a spot far in the distance of its virtual space. The spot glows brightly; the computer helpfully adds the logo 'DELTA CANCRI 6' below. Whatever it is doing, it's related to the world of New Queensland.

Jiro frowns. "My assumption was wrong," he says after a moment. "If it knows we're here, noticing the interface would be easy. Essaying communication after that would be easy as well. But there's something else.."

Archer says, "Concentrating on it, or getting orders? I think we're lucky so far. It looks like Aurora did successfully cover up our presence on the Gate."

Several seconds elapse, and the pylon dims to its usual translucent state. The dark figure resumes its deliberate routine as if nothing had changed. Oi, however, is tapping rapidly on the keyboard, his brow furrowed. "I think it was phoning home. It... probably wasn't about us."

"But you can't be sure," says Leandra. "Can we tell if most of the traffic is directed out to New Queensland or coming from there? It would be interesting to see just how these larger nodes associate."

Archer's current humming is something dirge-like. He twitches an eyebrow at Oi's comment and asks, "How probably are you talking, here?"

Jiro shakes his head. "It's talking on a relatively open channel," he mumbles, still thinking hard about something. "It won't discuss its plans with us listening, if it knew we were."

"It's going... ummm.... from everywhere, to everywhere, Leandra," Oi says. "Some places are acting as relays... New Queensland is both the most common sender and receiver."

"Is there any way we can find out where else New Queensland is sending signals to?" asks Leandra. "I'm interested to learn more of how this system functions. I would guess it works like a computer network's messaging system."

"Hey... now that you mention it, this is really funny..." Oi's typing slows. "I don't know what this means. But some of this stuff that's coming up from the ground, still has standard network packet headers on it. Like some of the old computers are still operating there." He frowns. "Which I can only tell because the 'digital rights management' crap on it is so thick. Next it's going to be telling me that I have to buy a license for 'Alien AI 2816'."

Archer chuckles. "Won't you just forge a license for it, then?"

Oi's frown deepens. "This is Enn Kew, remember, mate? Can't forge a wrapper for a pack of chewing gum there. Society about as free as a tax audit..."

"How much do we know about the backdoors into the New Queensland systems, Oi?" asks Jiro. "If the entity is dependent on such systems, we may be able to take advantage of that fact."

Archer says, "Even if it's not dependent, per se, if some of the old architecture is still inside it, the back doors are there, too. Interesting thought..."

"Love ta oblige you, Jiro," Oi says. "We didn't have much about that on Ayer. Government secret and all that crap. But no government every threw away its own keys." He shrugs. "Maybe someone on the surface will be able to tell us? Or maybe I can chisel some meself. Can't take that long. All that spyware was written by the lowest bidder."

"I was thinking that we might be able to send some of our messages out," says Leandra. "If we can duplicate the proper codes, we can find out if these nodes have any of their own intelligence, or if they are just like a large nervous system."

Finally Jiro seems to snap out of his thought-trance. "Alright," he says. "We'll do data collection. We have a probe heading to New Queensland. If human survivors can last a hundred years, I trust them to survive three weeks more. Our priorities are the entity and its radio traffic, and the backdoors into the mundane systems."

Archer nods. "Sounds good. Stay here, or go back to the ship?"

"Stay here," says Jiro, pointing at the display. "We need to learn everything we can about this."

The day passes slowly. There's not a hell of a lot to do on the grounded Walkabout. Fortunately, the shuttle is big enough that each member of the crew can retire to seperate areas and not irritate each other. Several hours later, Oi and Archer are napping in hammocks in the cargo bay, while Jiro and Leandra are sitting on the bridge.

Leandra and Jiro's efforts have yielded some results towards deciphering the alien psychology of the entity you are calling Schwarzgeist. Each of the derilect spacecraft, abanadoned outposts, and other mysterious sources of radio traffic seem to have some unique characteristics - not quite a personality, but just enough variation that they might be very similar individuals, rather than a single individual.

Archer and Oi have contributed tweaks to the data collection to allow filtering and graphing of traffic with a crude guess as to origin and endpoint - and as Leandra saw, the bigger the node, the higher the volume of data that goes through it - and, presumably, the larger its ability to number crunch.

The screen on Oi's dataset shows bar graphs of the traffic between the top fifty nodes in the system, with New Queensland being far and away the largest. The bars fluctuate slowly. Then, suddenly, the display freezes, and flashes red. A buzzer sounds in Oi's bunk, followed by a muffled crash as the hacker clumsily rolls out of his hammock in the low-gee environmnet.

Archer nearly trips over Oi, but gets to the flight station before he reaches his computer. "Talk to me. What's wrong?"

The main display on the bridge clears and shows a projection of the space nearby. An ominous red blip, marking a single craft of approximately 100 tons, has just departed another location in the sparse Delta Cancri 7 asteroid belt, and is thrusting towards the Tango Hotel. It's unmistakably a Revenue Fleet ship, and it will reach your location in 48 hours. The window containing the projection of the robed figure pauses momentarily, spreading its arms towards the bogey in a welcoming gesture, before resuming its orchestral routine.

Archer says, "Ah. I believe we have another deadline, people. I want to be back on Aurora and outbound in no less than 24 hours before ETA."

Jiro nods. "Make it so," he says, rousing himself from his own thoughts.

Archer says, "Anything else we need to do here?"

Oi fumbles with his datagoggles. "Get the probe back. Or leave it... it will take me all day to make another one."

Archer says, "Hmm. I think it'll be safe enough to wait another twelve hours if you're getting good data."

"If we have twelve hours, then I'd like to confirm what's inside the station," says Jiro. "I'm getting an idea, but I need more data about the layout of these things."

Archer says, "Hmm. They haven't noticed us much yet, and they don't seem to have many mobile units. Probably safe enough... Who should go along with you, Jiro?"

The cleric smiles. "Whoever trusts me. Oi should stay here at least. Leandra as well. But if you are willing to act as my prior warning, you'd be useful."

Archer says, "How far are you planning to explore? I think I'd be interested in coming along."

"I want to see if anything from New Queensland has been left over here, but more importantly I need to look at how prevalent the crystal entity is inside," explains Jiro.

In the short time remaining, a plan forms. Together, Archer and Jiro will enter the transfer station proper. No more than eight hours will be allotted to this operation. What Jiro is looking for is two-fold: examples of New Queensland technology that may have the famed security backdoor code in it, and knowledge about the crystal installation here. Leandra and Oi will continue monitoring the entity and contact the pair if trouble becomes imminent.

Archer buttons up the ship and prepares for liftoff, choosing a profile to minimize the powered flight time above the horizon of the little worldlet.

Archer docks with Aurora just long enough for Leandra and Oi to scramble back. The two crewmembers quickly make their way to the bridge and begin preparations for departure. Archer is preparting to depart for the transfer station on the asteroid when Jiro notices that his communicator is beeping; he's being hailed by Viktor.

Jiro answers. "Go ahead?"

A low-resolution version of Viktor's simulation flickers onto the display. "Jiro... may I accompany you on this excursion? I think it is both germain to my role as your advisor. I also am personally curious about the entity." The infomorph's tone betrays none of its usual sarcasm. Viktor seems serious.

"Very well," replies the cleric, after a moment. "Hard-wired link to the suit only, A/V only. I don't want anything getting into you."

Viktor nods. "I appreciate the need for precaution." He derezzes. The departure of the shuttle is delayed a moment for Jiro to retrieve the circuit module, and Archer un-docks, bound for the transfer station below.

The Tango Hotel habitat is built into the wall of a shallow crater about half a kilometer across. Archer puts the shuttle down onto an abandoned landing pad. Even though it appears nothing has landed here in a hundred years, the shuttle kicks up only a small amount of regolith - on the airless world, there's no wind to drive the dust over the pad. Several other landing pads and hangers are scattered haphazardly in front crater wall. Some of the portholes in the wall glow with light, indicating that the base must still have some power. Otherwise, all is silent and immobile.

Jiro's armored suit is an impressive sight, striding powerfully across the old landing field, the on-board computers carefully compensating for both his extra mass and the reduced gravity. Archer, however, has an uncanny adaptation to low-gee environments, and bounces along lightly. Archer reaches the primary airlock first and finds that, remarkably, the control panel is still operational. Even so, the controls show that the inside of the base is depressurized.

Archer says, "No air inside. No surprise, really; the crystals did seem to prefer inert atmosphere on the Gate."

With the pressure on both sides of the airlock equalized, it takes only a minute to cycle through. The airlock opens onto a large reception area, lined with spacesuit lockers and benches. The room is dimly lit by old lighting fixtures in the cieling. There is little dust to speak of, but most of the supply lockers hang open and empty. A few empty bottles and bags are scattered carelessly on the floor. A large bulkhead door at the rear of the room is closed - that must be the entrance to the complex proper.

Jiro takes a breath of his suit's air supply. He feels it filling his lungs, feels the oxygen cycle into his bloodstream, feels himself exhaling. _You never know whether your next breath will be there,_ he reminds himself. _Nor what comes next in this life._ "Alright, let's go," he says, stepping forward.
