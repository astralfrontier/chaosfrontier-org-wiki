# Synthetic Saints 2004-09-16

In the shuttle on the way to the transfer station, Viktor has a quiet chat with Jiro. The 'artificial conscience' projects himself on a screen inside of Jiro's helmet, and so there is little chance of interruption. The program presents the usual robed philosopher's aspect; Viktor clears his throat and begins. "Well. I don't suppose I have to tell you of the risks involved in this undertaking." He pauses. "Nor do I think you would be dissuaded by them."

"But I think you will tell me anyway," says Jiro with a smile, as he leans back a bit. "So go ahead, and we'll see how I take it."

"Very well," Viktor nods. "Let's grant for the moment that the Aurora entity was, in fact, an Aeon as we understand them. It was quite powerful, and seemed mostly benevolent. Or at least indifferent." He shakes his head. "I'm sorry I wasn't there for that. I hope we have another opportunity to meet one." He continues. "The entity we're calling Schwarzgeist... does not seem to be of the same type. And its benevolence is by no means guaranteed."

"I don't think there's any evidence of benevolence," counters Jiro. "The words I would use for its behavior so far are curiosity and tolerance. But go ahead."

Viktor nods again. "I think that makes my point, however. Aurora was quite powerful - exceedingly so. To use a crude metaphor, when one dances with mammoths... one must expect to get one's toes stepped on. Or worse. Perhaps walking away from such an encounter with one's head intact is a kind of indifference that might be called benevolence if one ignores the relative scales."

Viktor adopts a meditative pose. "For most people, the threats to their gnosis are either quite simple, or quite abstract. The Exiles prohibit certain activites that they know to be dangerous - the classic example of this is a worldwide neural uplink - the sort of thing that could, as they say, 'rewrite' everyone involved. With Schwarzgeist, we're dealing with something much more concrete here. I'm sure you've already considered that your fellows on Ayer won't want it following you home."

Jiro nods slowly. "I'm not sure they'd be terribly anxious to have the Aeons too close either."

Viktor asks, "So that brings us to the important question. Do you know why you are engaging in this activity? Specifically descending into another place infested by a dangerous entity, and also the activity of dealing with it in general?"

Jiro holds out his hands, gesturing as he speaks. "This system is the home of a dangerous entity. The planet certainly is under its control. Our mission requires we inevitably go there. Confrontation with this being is midway through every decision tree I can envision. This station seems to be the least dangerous of our options for more direct contact."

Viktor nods. "Then you are picking your options carefully, and that is good. As Nietzsche said - 'If you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you'.

"It's my life," smiles Jiro. "As to Schwarzgeist's intentions, either it is hostile to humanity on general principle - in which case I'm surprised that it would know of human survivors on New Queensland and tolerate them - or it simply wishes to achieve its objectives without interference. Here, where we are no direct threat to its Gate ambitions, it seems likelier that we can discover what its motives are without a fight."

A diagram appears in front of Viktor, showing the relative positions of the Tango Hotel and the approaching Revenuer. "The likelihood of avoiding a fight... is probably directly realted to whether we can accomplish that goal before this interloper arrives."

---

The ready room inside the Tango Hotel is lit by flickering light panels in the cieling that cast a dim blue-white glow over the room. The walls are lined with vacc suit lockers, benches, and shelves for helmets and other equipment. Many of the lockers hang open and empty; pieces of space gear litter the floor - expended gas cylinders, EVA gauntlets, and flashlights.

The ready room opens onto what was once the spacious lobby of a luxury hotel. The plush carpet is still mostly free of dust and springy underfoot. There are signs that, a long time ago, this was a less luxurious facility. The cielings are vaulted, ribbed rock, about six meters high, and festooned with pipes and other mechanical fixtures. The lighting panels are still operative, and still flickering.

The reception desk is flanked by doors on either side that lead to the subjective north, and to the west, a large archway opens into an atrium 15 meters across.

The doors behind the reception desk show signs of having been blasted open, quite some time ago. The locking mechanisms are charred and slagged. The doors open into a room that you gather to be office space - movable partitions section off workstations, and glass-line cubicles along the back wall contain desks. All of the display screens are cold and dark. The lighting here doesn't flicker, but it is quite dim. Doors lead back to the reception area, and a bulkhead to the west opens onto another large room.

The team heads west into a room full of carts of linens, and lined with surprisingly low-tech washing machines. There are other lockers for maintainence and cleaning gear. Four service drones, about waist-high and festooned with cleaning and repair equipment, are gathered in a clump in the center of the room. The only light is from panels attached to the rough, vaulted cieling.

A discreet double-door leads to the atrium you saw from the reception area, and a single person-sized door leads west.

The door heading west is locked, but Oi uses a trick he learned on Ayer to energize the bolt without transmitting the proper code. It's tricky, but within a minute, he's convinced the bolt to withdraw, and the door opens.

Oi chuckles wryly as the door opens. "Heh. Reminds me of old times, back with Beazle... 'cept I don't think we're gonna find some professors secret stash of..." he stops himself, "Cooking spices," he decides, "In here."

Archer chuckles. "So what -did- you find in the prof's secret stash?"

Oi dead-pans. "Cinnamon."

This room looks like some form of warehouse, or storeroom. Shelves, loaded with boxes of many different sizes, extend from floor to cieling. Small, inert robots once ran along to tracks on the shelves to retrieve items; now they seem to be inert. A similarly-inert terminal is nearby. The south wall looks like a counter, and is closed off from the corridor beyond by a heavy rollaway steel shutter.

Archer says, "Room service, maybe?"

Jiro hmms. "This may be one of the things we've been looking for," he says, after a moment. "Let's do an inventory, if we can do one quickly."

Oi nods, "Certainly..."

Oi hmms. "Well, the good stuff'd be up there..." Oi scales the shelves, taking a look near the top, "Probably locked in a sa-blight..." Oi gives a dissatisfied grunt, "They've already been and looted the good stuff... although... hang on a tic, yeah... found some medkits. Oooh, all fancy and such. Mind helping me get 'em down? Huh. Wonder who took 'em?"

Archer says, "Might have been people here when the handbasket left the station, after all. They could've taken them along when they evacuated."

Jiro examines a small selection of datasets, nodding in approval. "This is a great start," he says to nobody in particular.

As you remove the medkits from the top shelf, you notice a movement near the front of the room.

Immediately Jiro hoists his rocket rifle from its sling and into the ready position, taking aim at the slight flicker of motion that caught his eye.

Archer turns more slowly, not sensing anything dangerous.

In the airless environment, the thing makes no sound... but a brief investigation shows that one of the inventory robots isn't completely lifeless. It bumps from left to right at about head-height on a track attached to the front shelf. It appears to be stuck.

Oi hefts his Gauss Rifle towards the door, scanning the room for whatever it was that caused the movement. Upon spotting the robot, Oi considers, "Think we can use it?"

Jiro stands down after a moment, breathing out a sigh. "Whatever we can get ourselves, let's take to the airlock, just in case this isn't the only animate thing here," he counsels. "After that, yes, check it out."

Oi nods, "Alright. Sounds advice Jiro. Thanks..."

The team fills a few shopping bags with small, expensive items and meets with no challenge on the trip back to the airlock. Then they come back to the storeroom through the door that Oi gimmicked open. The warehouse droid has stopped moving, but a few indicators glow on its surface, indicating a sembelance of life.

Archer peers a little more closely at the service drone. "Jiro, does that look like it might be vacuum-dried blood on the arms?"

"It does," the cleric concurs. "And it supports what we've seen elsewhere... We still need to be on alert."

Archer says, "Fair dinkum."

Oi considers, "Hey didja know that... er... dried blood. Hmm. You don't suppose though that those indicators mean anything? Hope it's not coming back to life..."

The drone doesn't move. Its optical sensors, normally only able to track items on the shelves, are panned all the way over to the drone's shoulder, and are focussed on the Aurora team.

"More things may start coming to life here. We should finish quickly," Jiro says, a note of urgency in his voice.

Archer says, "It's trying to. But if it was room service, it could've gotten people unaware. We're not going to be taken by surprise, at least."

"It's watching us..." mutters Oi, half to himself, half to the others. "Wull, we can at least find out about it."

Archer says, "Let's keep moving, before something that _is_ dangerous shows up."

Oi taps at his dataset for a few minutes, and isolates the robot's connection to a local radio network, which is almost devoid of traffic. Tt's transmitting an information signal that identifies it as a drone, property of the Tango Hotel resort, function of inventory control. Oi 'negotiates' acceptance as a maintainence techncian, and approaches the robot. Even so, the drone takes a feeble swipe with one claw hand, thumping it weakly against Oi's helmet, before Oi is able to shut it down.

The team returns to the reception area, and then goes into the atrium. There are the dessicated remains of a few trees here, planted in reservoirs of soil built into the floor. The south leads to a vertical shaft. In such light gravity, personnel don't bother with elevators. Vertical belts with attached pull rings are spaced along the walls; in better days, visitors could move up or down simply by holding onto the ring. A door in the back wall leads to a more conventional stairwell. It seems that the top level is about twenty meters up; and the bottom level is about twenty meters down.

A long, wide corridor leads from the atrium to the southwest. At this end of the corridor, and at twenty-meter intervals, a short stair on the left side goes up to an elevated walkway that parallels the corridor, seperated by a low glass wall topped by a banister. There are doors at ten meter intervals along the walkway that you gather lead to suites. There is a bulkhead door halfway down the corridor on the right; the bulkhead is closed.

The team detours from the bulkhead to check the suites. The sliding doors are protected by electronics locks similar to the one Oi defeated on the storeroom. Only one is unlocked, and it is luxurious indeed, even after a hundred years of neglect and exposure to hard-vaccum.

The beds are not covered in simple linen; at one time, it was a pseudo-living nanotech construct, self-cleaning and self-warming. Now it is dormant and inert. The closets contain, not just clothes, but a miniature factory for textile fabrication. Even now the floors shift with an exotic pattern of lights where the team steps. The bath is almost the size of a stateroom on the Aurora. The cieling and walls are an exotic arrangement of thousands of water and air nozzles; a plastic instruction card indicates that in the low gravity, it can scrub someone standing in it without touching them at all.

Archer says, "Impressive stuff, here. I don't think I'd trust any of it, though."

Oi curses. "It's sunk too far into the wall... I can't get at the right bits and pieces. Of course, we could always try the more conventional, projectile opening method..."

Wasting little time, Jiro approaches the barrier. As his mechanical hand contracts tightly against the suit's wrist, triple talons extend and slice effortlessly through the armored door, taking the locking mechanism with them. "We're on a schedule," intones the cleric, resuming his guard duty.

Archer says, "Remind me not to shake hands with you when you're wearing that thing, Major..."

The door swings silently open, the shredded plastic barrier looking much worse for the wear. The room inside has a row of consoles on one wall, under a wide-screen holographic projector. The other wall has a gun rack, populated with four stunners. The sterile decor is marred by a dessicated corpse slumped on the floor in the corner.

Archer says, "Looks like someone didn't make it out."

Jiro holds out a hand. "This room was locked for a reason," he says, stepping across the threshold.

Oi nods, "It was... wonder why this poor sap was still in here..."

Archer says, "Who knows? Maybe he was the owner and didn't want to evacuate. This does look like a central control room of some sort."

Oi says, "Maybe he was sealed in here."

As Jiro steps in, the consoles come to life. Some of the displays show signals from what are obviously security cameras in other parts of the complex. Some show only static. The cause of death is pretty hard to determine; a hundred years of exposure to vaccum have pretty much mummified the poor soul who was trapped here. He doesn't show any signs of pre-mortem trauma.

After several minutes of work, Oi announces success. But before he gets up, Jiro holds up an armored hand. "Just a second," he says. "Is the entity still monitoring the security system?"

Upon hearing in the affirmative, Jiro nods. "And what are we classified as to the security system? You said earlier something about 'pests'. Is that the reading we're still tagged with?"

After a moment of reading what the display says, the cleric nods again. "Relabel us as foreign ambassadors, and re-activate one drone. Monitor its status, and ours. I'll go down and attach the interface rig. Evacuate if there's trouble."
