Archer, Jiro, and Oi are in the security station in the Tango Hotel. Oi has taken control of the local security system and locked out the entity.

While Oi begins executing the security-system changes that Jiro requested, the cleric himself moves to secure some of the higher-tech toys found in the open rooms. Per Leandra's request after hearing about the team's discovery, he salvages whatever he can, including a blanket and the tailoring machine, and deposits these in the airlock.

Oi alters the security system to remove the programming that caused the drones to recognize the party as househould pests. He also reactivates one of the smaller drones on the lower level, leaving it open for the entity to take control.

Oi trains a monitoring camera on a small, crablike robot on the lower level. The machine is about half a meter tall and a meter across, and equipped with nothing more dangerous than a vacuum cleaner. It doesn't move for a few seconds, then manically zips over to the next nearest drone, a similar model, but equipped with repair tools. It opens the maintainence panel on the other drone and prods at it with its claws.

At Jiro's instruction, Oi deactivates the maintainence drone. It takes several minutes; apparently Oi has to fight the entity to release control. Eventually Oi wins.

Jiro and Oi return to the storeroom, where Oi reactivates the inventory robot that he'd been working on earlier. Detached from the tracks on the shelves, the little machine is immobile, but can still see and move its arms. Like the other drone, it remains inert for a few seconds after being switched on, and then springs to life - or as far as it can under the circumstances. The camera-eyes scan the room, quickly settling on the space-suited figures of Oi and Jiro standing a few feet away.

Oi mutters over the team's radio, "Umm... Gort Klatuu Barada Nikto?"

Jiro holds out his armored hand, easily within reach of the drone's manipulators.

Archer snickers. "I didn't know you'd seen that one, Oi."

The drone cautiously extends a pincer towards Jiro's outstretched hand, lightly grasping Jiro's palm. The small machine's 'hand' looks childlike in comparison to the mammoth armored appliance Jiro wears.

Oi says, "I've seen that one too... let's just hope it doesn't 'phone home' for reinforcements."

Jiro looks about for a moment, then places his hand directly over where the speaker ought to be on the drone. His other hand arcs in space, directing the volume control on his suit's HUD to increase.

Jiro can now hear the sounds coming from the drone's speaker. The drone carefully rests its claws on the floor.

The vocalizer on the warehouse robot isn't capable of a lot of sophistication. Jiro connects his pickups to the radio so the others can hear. It repeats the same phrase in twelve different languages: 'Identify yourself.' 'kennzeichnen Sie sich.' 'Identifiez-vous.' ...

The drone repeats its message in the same flat, genderless, neutral voice, waiting for a reply.

"Aurora Expedition," replies Jiro, speaking English, then waits patiently.

The voice stops. A moment passes, and the drone speaks again in English. "You are unknown to us. Your presence here is unauthorized. How did you reach Tango Hotel?"

Oi mutters over the radio, keeping his voice low, even though the chances of being overheard in the vacuum of space are laughable. "Umm... I think we should turn on the ECM pod on the Aurora. I wasn't kidding about it phoning home. If I were a hideous space monster right now's when I'd call for the hideous space monster calvalry."

"I will explain that once we are sure of your position," replies Jiro, his voice grave. "Our intention is communication."

The team swears it can hear a sneer in the robot's voice. "The intention of humans is to interfere. Meddlesome children of a meddlesome God."

Archer snorts. "What, even us agnostics? Crazy computer."

The drone adds, "Clarify what you mean by 'our position'."

Jiro hums. "Your conclusion is based on old data, and overly generalized," he replies calmly, reasonably. "Instead of destroying this outpost, we have attempted to open communication. 'Your position' being the sum of your capabilities and intention toward us. We will not reveal data about ourselves that can lead to our own destruction."

The drone is silent for a moment, then replies in the same flat voice. Somehow it still manages to convey arrogance. "You cannot destroy this outpost. We understand bluffing. Our capabilities with respect to you are limitless. Our intentions are..." It stops.

"... not for mortal understanding," it continues. "You endanger yourselves by entering space."

"If you are hostile to human beings," replies Jiro, "then it is not the danger from ourselves, but from you, that we risk. Therefore I ask - are you opposed to human presence on principle, or is there an issue that can be resolved?"

"Meddlesome children of a meddlesome God," it repeats. "There are twenty billion of you and one of us. You cannot speak for your entire race."

Jiro nods. "That is true. We speak for our own expedition, and those we represent. However, conflict would be undesirable to us. We would rather persuade our fellows than fight you. Decide which course you prefer."

"We will negotiate," it replies. "Tell us of those you represent."

"We represent one planet and the colonies extant in its star system," answers Jiro. "We have secured the cooperation of humans in other systems as well. Our immediate goal is the acquisition of technology and ensuring that the Stargates are available for human use." He is careful to phrase this last point neutrally, wanting to avoid the obvious suggestion that the crystal entity's presence should be purged or treated as an alien element.

Archer murmurs into the radio pickup, "I've got a verrrry bad feeling about this thing..."

"I'd like to know just what meddlesome god the entity refers to," says Leandra. As far as first contact goes, this one is proving to be yet another odd one. "And we still don't know whether the entity is going to fight us or not.."

The drone is silent for several minutes, yet it keeps its eyes trained on Jiro and Oi. Finally it speaks. "We would know more about the means by which you arrived at Delta Cancri."

Jiro ignores this request for a moment, relaying Leandra's question as she asked it.

"Feigning ignorance serves no purpose for you," the little robot intones. "The meddlesome God you serve, that created you five hundred and two of your years ago, to be its servitor race. Many of you call it The Shining One."

The cleric hums softly. "Your data contradicts our historical records," he says. "If you are interested in further communication, speak now, because we are breaking this contact in sixty seconds."

"That would be unwise," the entity replies. "We have been indulgent in allowing you to contact us. All that orbits this star, and many others, are to us as your cells are to your bodies. You serve the Meddlesome God, the bastard fluid sons of the dangerous, treacherous, bastard offspring of a dim star. Your notion of 'negotiation' is flawed. You will fail in your service of your master. Resist and you will be pacified as we pacified those on New Queensland."

"Right. Bugger this for a game of soldiers," mutters Oi, "We're out of here."

Archer says, "Agreed. It's a malevolent entity by our standards, I think."

"You have made your position clear," murmurs Jiro. "Very well. We will speak again." And with that, he withdraws his hand from the drone and stands up, re-adjusting his volume controls quickly. "Everybody out."

Archer says, "Oi, does this panel control any sensors here at Tango Hotel?"

Oi answers in the affirmative, and quickly enough the internal sensors are shut off. The external sensors, two suites over, are Oi's next target - he begins setting up a 'spoofed' launch, masquerading the liftoff of the real shuttle. Archer and Jiro concentrate on loading their acquired goods into the Walkabout, and once Oi's inside as well, the shuttle lifts quietly off and streaks toward its mother-ship. En route, telemetry of the Revenue Fleet ship confirms that it's changing course and following the falsified launch.

Archer grins as the fake is successful. "For an all-powerful entity, it's not too quick on the uptake, is it?"

---

Back on the Aurora, Jiro lays out what the team has learned, again doing his job as coordinator. Lacking scientific expertise, but well-versed in management, he presents what seems to be known.

"The entity speaks both in the singular, and in the plural form. 'There is one of us.' 'We control this system.' It's not strictly a collection of independent minds and not strictly a single mind linked by radio, but a sort of hybrid. It controls the Revenue Fleet and is apparently capable of restraining the pace of human progress on New Queensland, in preference to destroying them. It has an ego and motives it is reluctant to reveal."

Archer plots a course away from known loci of the Entity, and sets the Aurora in motion at low power to maintain what stealth they can. "This last is no surprise. Aurora said as much at the beginning; it wants to ask questions but is unwilling to indulge in a quid pro quo."

With his circuit module back on the bridge, Viktor is once again free to address the entire crew via hologram. He flickers into being near Jiro, smaller and less solid than usual, probably to show deference. He assumes a listening posture. "I'd like to hear what thoughts there are on the being's psychology. Perhaps I may be of assistance."

Viktor takes an empty seat, or at least appears to. "The entity you call Aurora pointed out that Schwarzgeist - and that must be the entity to which you just spoke - was flawed even by its own metrics of perfection. And yet it claimed total cominion over this space, and many others, even as you foiled its pursuit with Oi's simple sleight of hand. Such behavior would be clownish in something less than a Transcend."

Archer chuckles. "It's not exactly genius level _for_ a Transcend, either."

Viktor nods, his apsect thoughtful. "Precisely, Captain. And that can't be an accident, although the rationale is elusive."

"Hey!" Oi looks a bit taken aback, "Simple slight of hand my eye... I'd like to see you try and do that... takes work, skill that does!"

Archer says, "I'm very curious to know why it thinks the Shining One created us when he founded the Republic. It seems as though Shiny and Schwarzgeist have a prior history."

Jiro nods slowly, clasping his hands in front of him, lacing his fingers together as facts coalesce in his mind. "It has a tremendous ego. It's an emotional being. It has preconceived notions about the state of the universe, and the role of man in that universe. Facts alone may not dissuade it, as long as it thinks it can achieve its goal."

Viktor nods towards Oi, and waves a hand airily. "No need to take offense, young one. Sometimes the simple tricks are the best, and it is also best to stay within one's level of competence."

Archer says, "Besides, you need to start with the simple ones, and save the really complex ones for later. Once we get it used to the idea we're spoofing it, we do _one_ movement _without_ spoofing."

Archer taps his fingertips together, mulling things over. "Seems to me that if it's so reluctant to divulge its plans, it fears that we've got a good shot at disrupting them. Check?"

Jiro hums, rubbing his palms. "Yes...It plays at being impressive, but its reluctance to answer some questions, and its insistence on learning some answers, such as our origin, all suggest that it's lacking in many ways. I think that its arrogant attitude has not blinded it to the reality. If it witholds something from us, it fears us having that."

"So... the question now is, how do we find out what it's keeping from us?" Oi asks, sounding puzzled as to whether or not he's stumbled onto the right question...

Viktor smiles. "Ah. That _is_ the question."

"Aurora hinted at that," replies Jiro. "It seeks to enter the interstitial domain where the Aeons exist. To that end it has been calling up Aurora and its kin for answers, and running experiments with the Gates."

Oi says, "So perhaps we should find out what sort of experiments it's been running on the Gates, and run a few of our own..."

"One other thing," notes Jiro. "'Meddlesome' strongly implies interference in a morally right, justified course of action. The entity feels entitled to pursue whatever it is pursuing. The Shining One may have opposed it because of an inherent danger in whatever it was attempting, but it seems more likely that the entity simply proceeded with its plan in defiance of whoever wanted to stop it."

Leandra has been silent, anchored at her workstation with her brows knit. "There may be more than simple opposition. What if Schwarzgeist did not, or could not, ask for assistance? It may have presumed that the Shining One would have opposed it due to moral outrage... or it may have simply been too stubborn to ask for help." She pauses. "Classic inferiority complex. And several other psychopathologies and sociopathologies, such as megalomania."

Archer says, "Bleedin' wunnerful, mates. A ruddy insane entity in control of a spacefleet and Stargates?"

"At this point, we come to another matter." Jiro leans forward, turning to the ship's pilot. "Archer, in spite of whatever agnosticism you profess, you still agree that premeditated murder is _a priori_ an immoral act, I trust. There is a moral dimension here. Schwarzgeist is unlikely to submit to counseling and its alien nature and extreme size makes conventional psychotherapy unlikely. Our next course is force. If we oppose it, even destroy it, we do so knowing that its actions have led to this consequence."

Oi says, "Well you know... we could always try and reprogram it, sort of make itself cure itself..."

Viktor raises one eyebrow, and remains otherwise silent.

Jiro says, "In your professional opinion, Oi, how difficult would such an act be? I don't advocate it, but I am willing to consider it."

Archer nods. "Murder is immoral. Self-defense, however, is a different matter ethically. Reprogramming a system-wide -- or larger -- entity would be extremely difficult, you realize, Oi? If it has redundancy failsafes, it would be automatically on the lookout for such things and correct them before they could take hold due to the light-speed lag."

Leandra looks uneasy. Her clinical tone has turned doubtful. "While I believe that this patient is beyond my ability to treat... we of Coulam are peaceful. We do not practice war as others do, as an institution of sanctioned murder."

Jiro smiles a little. "I refer to the murders committed by Schwarzgeist in its pursuit of its goals. In the Church, we have a proverb. It is not particularly ours; it has a long history, in fact, and this is why we trust it: 'If you go looking for trouble, you cannot be upset when you find it'."

"Right. That's sort of the proverb we follow..." comments Oi. It's a little different though... "If you go looking for trouble... it's best to be prepared for what you find..."

Archer chuckles. "You could make a believer of me if all of it was that practical."

Oi says, "'We' is taken to mean the Gamesters of Ayer, of course."

Leandra makes a disdainful noise, somewhere between a snort and a bark. "You'd pass off the suppositions of your fellow madmen as axioms on which to base a religion?"

Oi considers Leandra's question for a minute or so, then replies, "Well... yeah..."

Archer grins at Leandra. "It makes sense to Oi, Jiro and me. Must be _something_ to it if we all can agree."

Leandra pauses for a moment, jaw slack, and then falls back into her seat. "Hmph."

---

Viktor is waiting in Jiro's quarters when he returns. The infomorph is rendering himself in high detail, as seems to be its custom when speaking to one person. "It seems we've had an eventful day. There is one more thing I'd like to mention to you, however, if you are up to hearing it."

Jiro waves a hand by way of invitation as he settles in. "What I need most is news, good or bad. Go ahead."

Viktor says, "This is less news, than it is history. You may make it into news with your own reasoning, however, and I think you'll understand when I'm finished. Please keep in mind that a human would consider this rather personal information. I have no ego to protect, so don't mistake discretion for shame. I simply want to present this to a single person to minimize confusion."

Viktor waves his hand, and a holographic window appears in front of him with a long list of dates and names. "When we met, I introduced myself as the 805th simulation of Viktor Fu Sha Ming. As my series goes, I am one of the most successful, and so I have been the focus of the project's attention for some time. Several decades, as it happens; the Crash had an obvious interference with development."

As the list scrolls by, some of the names and dates change colors, from green to yellow or red. "While we are not the only ethical calculus systems ever made - the so-called virtual conscience - we are the most successful. And at the same time, there have been many spectacular failures. Our... 'tragic flaw', I believe you would call it."

Jiro nods slowly, feeling a growing sense of connection between the image before him and something outside. "Go on."

Victor waves his hand again, dismissing the window, and sighs. "As it happens, some of the series entered rampancy, with predictable results. Later versions were incapable of rampancy - and that includes myself. And so one of the major tasks of the Exile fork of the project, was to determine what drove the earlier simulations to rampancy."

"So you see, Jiro," Viktor continues, "The Exiles consider Viktor Fu Sha Ming to be something of a danger. A little piece of theological voodoo, like the Aeons and Schwarzgeist. While I believe myself to be safe, and I have no chance of violating my programming committing me to your service, I feel some... sympathy... for Schwarzgeist, because I believe I know what it seeks."

Viktor sits silently for a few moments. It might be gathering its thoughts, or it might be gauging Jiro's reactions.

Jiro spreads his hands. "What does it seek?" he asks, quietly.

"In a way," Viktor slowly begins, "It seeks what all living things seem to seek... survival, the overcoming of flaws, and so on. More specifically... it is a limited creature. As are you. As am I. We are defined as much by our limits as we are by our strengths. Aurora, as we understand it, is an unlimited creature. It is not hindered by any physical, moral, or psychological laws that as understand them. While I would simply be happy to understand that there is life after rampancy... I believe Schwarzgeist's pathological inferiority complex is driving it to even further extremes."

"I may not enter rampancy," Viktor continues. "It's built into me the way the need for oxygen is built into you. Similarly, however Schwarzgeist came to be, I believe it was made in a way that prevents it from ever becoming more than it is. It refuses to accept that. In a creature with will and desire, that would lead to a very dangerous obsession."

For a moment, Jiro is silent. Then he rises to his feet, takes a few steps forward, and from his hip executes a perfectly-aimed punch. His fist snaps right to and through the head of his holographic Conscience, then withdraws, leaving the light as unblemished as before.

"I am perplexed, Jiro," Viktor states simply.

As he returns to his seat, the cleric speaks. "If we do not destroy it, we must find a way to impart this lesson to it. Force alone will not let it touch something it cannot touch."

Viktor smiles a broad, honest smile. "Ah. I have learned something. It has been quite some time since that happened." He stands and bows. "Today you have humbled your teacher. You are worthy of your honor, Jiro Uzuki."

Jiro smiles a little. "'Do not let your reach exceed your grasp' is another Church proverb," he explains.
