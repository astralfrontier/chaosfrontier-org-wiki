# Synthetic Saints 2004-10-07

The Aurora is parked in a shallow orbit over a small asteroid in the Delta Cancri belt, having fled the abandoned Tango Hotel. The approaching Revenue Fleet cutter appears to have diverted to follow the false trail that the team fed to Schwarzgeist's sensors, and for the moment, all is quiet.

Oi spends the time dissecting the datasets recovered from the hotel storeroom. Within minutes he has the small appliances open and parts strewn over the Aurora's workshop. He quickly isolates the notorious 'backdoor chip' - a small quantum-optical CPU wired into the guts of every mass-produced electronic device on New Queensland. The eccentric hacker spends a lot of time grumbling and pacing on the zero-gee treadmill, muttering dire imprecations about the designers' lineage. "It's using quantum encryption," he reports in one of his more lucid moments, "so it's nearly impossible to crack. Nearly... but not totally. It's just going to take a lot of time to nail the protocol down totally. It would be easier if the datasets were actually 'under attack', so to speak. But in order to do that we'd have to put them in range of a working data radio network - as in take them down to the planet."

Leandra, meanwhile, has been working on the more prosaic objects obtained from the Hotel. The bedclothes, in particular, are masterworks of biological engineering. Even after a hundred years in hard vaccum, the quilts - somewhere between a smart material and a living thing - are 'revived' through the re-introduction of oxygen and warmth. In the zero-gee environment, they float off of the lab bench and flutter gently in mid-air, looking for a bed or body to cling to. The quilt material show distortions of color and striations where the fabric bends of its own volition.

Archer puts the Aurora on course for New Queensland, running the drives at only a fraction of their usual output. The acceleration produces a simulation of gravity on the scale of the surface of Dromedary, or the Tango Hotel. A few days later, the Aurora's probe reaches New Queensland. The first thing that the probe reports, even from several thousand miles out, is that the skies over the planet are cluttered with space junk - dead sattelites, abandoned and trashed habitats, smashed Revenue Fleet cutters, and derilect spacecraft ranging in size from a few tons to bulk freighters several times larger than the Aurora itself. The on-board computers request assistance from Aurora's navigation system several times, seeking solutions to approaching the planet without being demolished.

Archer says, "Interesting. We ought to be able to hide among the junk, if we're careful during the approach. Opinions?"

Jiro studies the readouts on his display, nodding after awhile. "Schwarzgeist will expect us to make a move," he says. "Either to hide here and formulate a plan, go to the planet, or attempt to seize control of a Stargate. The debris field will make good cover, and we need to find out more anyway."

As the probe works its way into lower orbits, it sends back an irregular and erratic picture of conditions on the surface. Overall, the planet is two degrees cooler than the average shown on record. The ice caps have grown slightly, and the presence of water vapor and greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is much reduced. There is some radio chatter in the microwave bands, mostly from the site of New Perth on the western continent. All of it is heavily encrypted; some is beamed directly to space, other transmissions are beamed to larger hulks in medium or high orbits.

After assembling the radio-traffic reports, Jiro points at New Perth itself on his screen. "There. That's the master node," he concludes, quietly. "We need to start assembling a contingency plan for it.. And I think I've got the start of one."

Archer says, "We need to enter orbit on the opposite side of the planet, and bring the shuttle in from that side, too, then. Let passive drift take us over New Perth the first time so we can get a close-up scan."

Finally, the probe clears the junk belt, and enters the relatively clear zone below 500 miles in altitude - apparently much of the low-orbiting junk re-entered on its own, or was cleared by other means. The probe expends the last of its fuel to establish a polar orbit that covers the planet about once every seventy minutes. While the sensors are relatively primitive, the power computers on the Aurora are able to interpolate and synthesize the stream of data, giving a detailed picture of conditions on the sruface. Neutrino emissions, the signature of advanced civilizations, are absent from the planet except in two areas - the site of the city of New Perth, and Fraser's Island, site of both the Republican Embassy and the Coulam colony. The only detectable radio traffic comes from New Perth, which is on the night side when the probe passes over it. In the thermographic image, the miles-wide crater in the center of the city stares out into space like an unblinking, diseased eye.

Leandra pays close attention to the planet below, monitoring the sensors with care before finally explaining everything she sees. "There seems to be operating fusion reactors in New Perth, operating in the gigawatt scale. I can't see any other heat sources there, which would indicate that there are no farms or vehicles. There are some signs of what I'm guessing are small cooking fires on the island of Tasmania. Perhaps they are serving to heat primitive houses, as well." She frowns in thought and goes on, "The planet seems to be cooling, as well. It may have something to do with the sun dimming during those experiments. It would seem logical."

Archer says, "Awfully quick for that to happen just from the last one. If it's been going on for a while, though..."

"From what I can tell this is more likely to have occurred over the course of decades, but a quick shift in the jet stream like I'm seeing here could, in theory, happen quickly." Leandra sighs and admits, "It's very hard to say, honestly, when so many strange entities could be interfering with us."

The Exiler stays busy on his own readings; while Leandra seems interested in the human populations, Jiro is more concerned with New Perth, and isolating the location of the 'master node' in the sprawling, if wounded, ghost-metropolis. Finally he pushes this work away and turns, inviting a conference of the team.

"We have unanswered questions," Jiro begins. "The Embassy on the planet is apparently still running. There are two major questions that I see needing answers. First, what is its status, given that we have seen co-opted Embassies on the Stargates? Second, what assets does Schwarzgeist have at its disposal to suppress mankind on the planet? I propose we land in one shuttle, allowing Aurora to drift over New Perth as Archer suggests, and see what we can learn from the more primitive people that seem to be indicated... After that, we visit the Embassy area."

Archer says, "I'd reverse that, I think. Land and talk to the Coulam first, then go into the Embassy with a bit of background info."

Jiro shakes his head. "Are we sure whoever's near the Embassy are the Coulam?" he asks. "Are we sure they haven't been changed? Remember Miller."

Archer says, "Well, no... that's certainly a possibility. But better to find out there first, rather than walking into the lion's den, eh?"

Jiro smiles a little. "Why not better to approach people even less likely to be affected first, for that matter?"

"I would be lying if I said that I am not eager to meet the Coulam of this planet," says Leandra. "And I'm afraid that impulse perhaps affects my ability to judge objectively. However, it seems logical to start with them. They are the least likely to have rampancy, but judging from what I see below.. rampancy has already had its way."

"We can visit both. However, I am firmly against going near the Embassy until we at least talk to some people with experience on the scene." Jiro sounds very firm in this conviction. "Once we do that, we'll evaluate our next move."

Archer says, "Only one way to find out for sure." He hmmms at his astrogation plotting. "I don't think we can get to New Queensland and back again before Aurora 2 arrives. What do you say we leave them a probe drone with a neutrino scanner and a database of everything we've learned so far? When A2 breaks out, it'll play back the information in case we've run into serious problems."

Jiro nods. "A drone works, and we've already built a few. We have our database of conclusions as well as the sensor data we just got."

Archer nods. "Fair dinkum. I'll get on it, then."

It's been several days since the team heard anything from Oi. The eccentric young man has only left his stateroom for trips to the fresher; the workshop is cluttered with empty foor wrappers and holographic scans of the backdoor chip from the gamma-ray microscope. Finally, Oi breaks the silence in his typical idiom, with a shout of triumph.

"GOT YOU,", Oi shouts, "You bastard son of a pair of brothers, I finally GOT YOU! You bloody fools!"

Jiro heads to the workshop quickly, from his own researches. "You broke the backdoor system?" he asks, urgently.

Archer is right behind. "I hope so. If he thinks he's found a roulette system, I'll put nitrous oxide in his air mix the next time we do EVA."

Leandra, for her part, isn't going to run around just because Oi is making a great deal of noise. Still, this time it might actually be important and have nothing to do with his foolish game. She doesn't say anything, but listens with interest.

The slender hacker shoots out of the doorway and ricochets off a bulkhead, chortling like a fool, and finally regains his footing. "Broke it? Broke it? I broke it, busted it, and rode it in the Kentucky freaking Derby, mate! Come have a look at this!" He gestures wildly at an electron micrograph of the chip, his arm passing right through some of the closer holograms. The image looks like a remarkably square set of mountain peaks and valleys, a small city etched into silicon crystals. "It's right there! I can't believe nobody saw it before!"

Archer says, "Bureaucrat design, eh?"

Jiro smiles quietly. "Alright. Now that you've got it, start working out what we can do with it. Ideally we will want to shut down ground-based defenses, if we decide to drop a big rock on New Perth again, but we may also want to disable other sensors and take control of computers on the ground."

Oi snorts and gestures at the valleys between the peaks. The image zooms in. "Maybe a beauracrat rubber-stamped this, but it sure wasn't any Solid Citizen who designed it. There's a back door in the back door. The encryption for the override protocol is nearly unbeatable - and it will probably take all week even to get into this dataset. But check this out. These are quantum-optical chips, right? Immune to EMP, right?" He's grinning from ear to ear, and it's obvious from the way he's talking that neither of these things is true.

Jiro hmms. "Just give us the executive summary," he says levelly.

Oi lets out an exasperated sigh. "The substrate of the optical circuit," he says, "is a traditional semiconductor. It doesn't do a damn thing under ordinary conditions - it's inert. Likely nobody ever thought to look at it. But just the right frequency in the millimeter-wave band will energize it and jam the optical circuit built on top of it. In short, if we get a big enough transmitter, we can blind or fry just about any infested computer on the surface of the planet."

Archer just whistles. "Cooo-eeee!"

Jiro nods slowly. "That's good, but not something we want to use immediately," he says. "What constitutes a 'big enough transmitter'?"

"Well..." Oi trails off. He pulls a slender wand from the workbench and presses a button in the end, waving it over the dismantled dataset on the bench. The micrograph brightens, and the valleys between the crystal slabs are filled with an irregularly pulsing light. When he removes the rod, the micrograph returns to normal. "Coupla watts at short range will jam it. Coupla tens of watts would kill it. At longer ranges... kilowatts or megawatts, depending on the area you want to cover."

Jiro nods. "The only major sources we want to knock out are the cities," he says, thoughtfully. "How about New Perth?"

Oi rubs his chin. "From low orbit?" He shrugs. "Coupla megawatts... the shuttle's engines could do it in a pinch, but they're thrusters, not radios..." He trails off again. "Gonna have to work on it, Cap... Major. We'll need a pretty big antenna."

Archer says, "Not likely to affect the crystal entity, I don't think. But we can jam any of their remotes built on the old templates, and it doesn't seem to be very ... innovative in that regard."

Jiro shakes his head. "No, this is important. Schwarzgeist can be disabled or destroyed with an EMP attack, as we have seen thanks to Aurora and the Stargate. If we can disable the linkages between it and its peer nodes, though, that is a valuable potential asset."

Jiro claps Oi on the shoulder and smiles. "Good work. I have one other project for you.. Work out the most efficient system to deliver an EMP attack capable of destroying a few thousand tons of crystal, once we locate it. The backdoor system can disable any sort of anti-missile defenses that might still be running, if what you come up with involves dropping something from orbit."

Oi looks startled, nearly losing his balance in the low gravity. "Uh... sure. I'll get right on it. Um. Dunno about the missle defenses, though. Remember, the spacers refused to use compromised gear? Well, if the military had any brains they'd do the same... but... We could just EMP those also..." He rubs his hands together. "This will take a little work. I'll get back to you."

The probe takes a series of high-resolution photographs of Tasmania on its tenth orbit. While the cameras aren't powerful enough to pick out individual people, it does pick out a small city. None of the buildings are bigger than a few stories high. Altogether it covers an area of about twenty square miles - perhaps large enough for a fifty thousand people, given the size of the buildings. The probe passes over in daytime, and can clearly see wharfs on the bay in the north side of town, with many ships at anchor.

As the probe finishes imaging Tasmania, it passes over the south pole, and then begins the second half of its orbit. This is the closest it has passed to the site of New Perth. As the satellite approaches the equator, a new stream of data appears - high-frequency imaging radar, coming up from the ground. The probe is on someone's air defense radar.

The probe detects the threat, and fires thrusters to change its orbit. With its primary fuel reserves exhausted, only the maneuvering engines are available to make the course correction. The probe localizes the source of the radar to a flat area north of New Perth, which maps show to be a military complex belonging to the planetary government.

As the probe continues its course, it passes out of range of the air defense complex, firing thrusters again to change course now that it's no longer observed. Even with the precautions, a few minutes later, the probe suddenly stops transmitting. The last milliseconds of data show an impact of some kind, and then nothing.

The team launches a log buoy, using one of the few remaining probe chassis, to rendezvous with the Aurora 2 when it arrives in two weeks. From its midpoint between the Delta Cancri belt and New Queensland, it should reach the ingress point within a few hours of the other ship's arrival. With the buoy in transit, the next stop for the Aurora is an abandoned habitat in orbit around the planet.

Archer moors the Aurora safely inside the wrecked shell of an old O'Neill-style colony cylinder. One entire end of the cylinder has been broken off somehow, and the structure tumbles slowly through space. The open end faces towards the planet about half the time, and Archer carefully points the sensor arrays towards the planet before powering down the ship.

On minimal power, the inside of the Aurora is a different place. Most of the holograms on the bridge are deactivated, leaving only the ribbed metallic walls. The 'storm shelter' in the forward section, already cramped, is dark and uninviting. Dim worklights come on in the halls as the team loads up one of the two Walkabout shuttles for the sortie to the planet. Overall, the power plants are emitting less energy that is reflected from the sun by the surrounding structure - which should hide the ship quite effectively.

The team straps into the shuttle carefully. After several months in deep space, a return to terrestrial gravity will be a shock on both man and machine. With procedures double- and triple-checked, inventories carefully computed, and vital systems mothballed to survive a few weeks of inattention, Archer seals the docking hatch between the Walkabout and the Aurora and casts off silently. The shuttle drifts out of the open end of the O'Neill cylinder, wrecked buildings and dessicated vegetation sliding by on the inside wall of the old habitat.

Archer steers the shuttle in a long arc over the surface of the planet, while Jiro and the others scan for traces of fuel that might be leaking from orbiting defense missles. The biggest risk is during the few minutes of the shuttle's de-orbit burn, when the engines will be visible from the ground - Archer chooses a moment when New Perth is on the opposite side of the planet for the maneuver. Then, several nerve-wracking minutes of silence as the shuttle falls towards the atmsophere, and finally, a rattle that rapidly builds to a roar at the moment of atmospheric interface. For better or for worse, planetfall is now inevitable.
