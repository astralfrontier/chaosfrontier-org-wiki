# Synthetic Saints 2004-10-14

The Walkabout shuttle enters New Queensland's atmosphere in a streak of ionized gas. For a full fourteen minutes, nothing is visible outside the viewports except the baleful orange glow of plasma, energized by atmospheric friction. Archer keeps the nose on the shuttle pointed high so that the ventral surface of the ship takes the brunt of the heating.

Soon, the orange glow fades, and the surface of New Queensland is once again visible through the viewports and cameras. The darkened mass of the eastern continent slides by below. The shuttle has re-entered from a polar orbit and the local time on Tasmania should be close to midnight. For the next ten minutes, Archer makes a series of s-turns to bleed of the remainder of the shuttle's energy, and then engages the shuttle's engines for atmospheric flight. The glider is once again an aircraft, and Tasmania is less than an hour away.

The thermographic cameras make it easy to pick out habitations. Even though the technology and cities have obviously regressed quite a bit, people still use energy. In this case, it seems that the use is pretty direct - burning fossil fuels for light and heat. There is a city with a large harbor that could house a quarter of a million people on the north side of Tasmania. The suburbs of that city extend for some distance, and thin out on the rugged terrain on the west side of the island. The team plans to land in a secluded area a day's walk from a village, and try to avoid detection.

Archer locates an area that isn't quite a clearing, but may have been at one point. The Walkabout is designed for landing under rough conditions. After several minutes of edging gently down on VTOL, the ship crunches to an abrupt and jarring halt, mashing a lot of underbrush in the process. Archer stops the engines. In the sudden silence, the sound of the ship's hull pinging as it cools is quite loud.

While Leandra hunches over her sensors, Jiro spends the time checking out his uniform. Identifying marks have been easily removed; what's left is a woven jumpsuit of synthetic arachnofiber with an eye-soothing blue color to it. He straps on his sword-belt, and after a few moments of consideration wraps his pistol up in its holster and slings it too. It'll take more time to draw from concealment, but it also won't attract the eye immediately.

Leandra needs a minute to just get used to being settled on the ground. She's no fan of reentry, even when she has something to distract her. There's just something to her about riding thousands of miles per hour in a fireball that is trying. "Well, here we are, then," she says calmly. "Things in the air are much as I'd expected, really. There are more people on Tasmania and the pollution indicates that they've been using coal and wood for some time."

Leandra will bring her usual array of medical gear and scanners, all stowed neatly in a bag that she makes appear as shabby as possible. It's amazing what a bit of dirt can do in that respect. She follows Jiro's instructions, wearing light body armor and doing her best to not stick out very much. She even consents to let her hair down a bit to cover her ears. "I hope they aren't completely backwards. It'd be a very major challenge helping them catch up on decades of innovation." She pauses to think for a moment, "And worse yet if it's centuries of technology that stand between us."

Archer locks down the shuttle and gets his gear ready. He's a little weighted down by the time he's finished; in addition to water and food, he's carrying his autopistol on one hip, a rapier on the other, and a compound bow and quiver of arrows on his back. His rock-hammer and Brunton compass ride his hip behind the rapier.

Jiro shakes his head. "Our job isn't to help them catch up for now," he advises firmly. "Right now we are here to learn what we can, then move on."

To his consternation, Oi is selected to stay behind and watch the ship. "Ain't fair, mate," he grouses. "I've never been to a place where you can breathe the air before. Not where they let me outside for more than a few hours, anyway." Nevertheless, the young man sets up a hammock for himself in the cargo bay and tunes his computer to monitor the radio traffic from the others.

Archer says, "If they're burning wood for heat, I think they've regressed a bit. Whether it's forced or not is the question."

"It's not our job right now," says Leandra. "But is a concern to me. We have to take very great care later. These people may have not even seen a ship that can enter space before. I hope they at least remember such things once existed, though. Either way, that's a concern for the future."

Archer nods. "It's not been that long. They'll have stories, at least."

Leandra gets to work as soon as she's got access to the soil. She's going to check soil quality for raising food crops, and also look around and see what she can learn about the local flora and fauna. She'll be in her own little world until Jiro tells her it is time to move on. Everything here is of great interest to her. She even takes the time to gather information for a weather forecast.

The night air is warm and moist. This is the tropical region of New Queensland. It's cooler and drier than similar areas on Earth, perhaps because the shuttle has landed in a clearing a few hundred feet above sea level. After months in space and a lifetime inside closed environments, the air tastes odd - rich and full of live. The surrounding forest teems with the sounds of small creatures and the rustling of branches in the wind. The trees are a mix of sub-tropical and deciduous plants, both native to the planet and hybrids made by splicing genes with terrestrial species.

The soil is a dark, airy loam, rich in nutrients. There has never been any agriculture in this area. Both the local skies and sattelite photos taken during the survey indicate that the weather is likely to be clear for some time, but Leandra estimates that it will be quite humid during the day.

"This is amazing!" Leandra declares, holding up a handful of dirt. "Simply amazing! This soil is as close to perfect as you can get for growing things! This place is so alive!" She laughs softly and turns about, trying to take it all in. "Don't you feel it?"

Under Leandra's expert guidance, the team rapidly leaves the shuttle behind. Even on this new world, the outdoors is of second nature to the Coulam - the field scientist has no problems finding the best paths, and avoiding harder terrain. Everyone stops frequently. The exposure to gravity after so long in space is only a small inconvenience - more often, Leandra insists that they take a few minutes to take samples of local flora and fauna.

Archer breathes deep as they walk along. "I can smell it, at the least. A bit like your gardens back on Ayer."

Leandra grows more and more thoughtful as the walk goes on. After about nine miles she stops and says, "Something is weird." She turns to face Archer and Jiro and breaks right into an explanation, "A lot of these are hybrids. They are Coulam work, but they should not be here. Coulam hybrids would exist on Fraser's Island, but to find them here is curious. My best guess is that we are going to encounter Coulam here, as well. Or at least there were Coulam here once. I'm not sure if this changes our strategy, but it does make me a potential risk, if there was a conflict over resources between the Coulam and the other inhabitants."

Jiro nods. "That is precisely what we are here to find out, actually," he says. "This is good. In the meantime.. no poison or radiations in the soil or air, it sounds like."

Archer says, "Shouldn't be. We'd have picked up serious radioactivity on the way down."

"Oh no, everything is very clean," says Leandra. "Well, except for the mess that burning coal is slowly causing. But we can fix that pretty easily once we get things secured."

Shortly after Leandra's declaration, the team comes upon a path - more of a rain-washed track than something made by man. But the path leads to lowlands, and within a few hundred feet, into an area with oddly different vegetation. It only takes a moment to figure out why - this is a tree farm. New trees have been planted on the stumps of those that were previously-harvested. The tall, slender poplars are planted in even rows that extend for quite some ways in every direction.

"This is more work that has been at least influenced by the Coulam," says Leandra. "Though it is.. odd. This is not something we would normally do. Perhaps they are desperate." To say Leandra sounds rather uncertain is to put it lightly. "This is not our way. I imagine things are not going very well here."

Jiro smiles a little, offering humor to lighten the mood a bit. "Your first sign of trouble in this system was the trees?" he asks.

Archer says, "Hardly a surprise. Should we wait, and arrive at the town after sunrise? Or should we try to arrive there and hide before the locals are awake?"

Jiro thinks a little bit. "Let's wait for awhile, then get to the town after people are up and about. We can at least observe them in action for a little bit before entering."

Leandra shakes her head at Jiro, "No, you are right. These are hardly the first sign, and yet.. these hit home to me in a way that little else could. I want to make things right here, Jiro. I don't really understand what is going on, but I intend to find out the full truth. I will not leave without answers." She laughs at herself a few moments later and lets out a sigh, "I will try to act more rational, as well."

Archer says, "Just don't let yourself be distracted by the puzzle, Leandra. We may run into hostile locals, and we'd best be ready to react if we do."

The team retreats to the edge of the natural forest and doses until first light. The sun has not yet cleared the horizon. The pre-dawn makes the ground steam, and a wispy low-lying fog that doesn't so much obscure visibility as rendering everything grey and indistinct. Within an hour, they've reached the village, and the sun has broken the horizon. The fog is starting to burn off and reveals fifteen small buildings. Some are made out of wood planks, others out of cinder blocks and sheet metal. Most are a combination of materials, including a few high-tech composites that look out of place in such a rustic setting. None are higher than two stories. The center of town is a simple, flat clearing, dry and dusty, with a ten-meter water tower in the center. The largest building has a wide, covered veranda on the front face, with a wooden sign hanging from the eaves. In the still morning air, the sign is easily readable - 'POPLAR GULCH - POP 50ish'.

The team hears noises from the buildings shortly after their arrival. Farmers wake up early - even tree farmers - and with dawn's first light there's the sounds of activity in the kitches of several of the buildings and the smell of woodsmoke from their chimneys.

Jiro finds somewhere for the team to hide, beneath a tarp with a cluster of very large rain barrels. They can hear the town waking up around them, but they shouldn't be visible unless someone trips over them.

The voices around them are loud, assorted male and female, young and old, gruff and cheerful. The team can overhear snippets of conversation from the two nearest buildings - apparently the nearest one is home to a carpenter, who complains loudly about problems negotiating prices for lumber with someone named Heath, who apparently owns the tree farms. There's no mention of Schwarzgeist, or visitors from space, or anything other than the pastoral setting around you.

After a few minutes, you hear the barking of dogs inside several of the houses, including the barrel-maker's house where you are hiding. The barrel-maker shouts out - "Hush up, Sadie! You're going to get fed just as soon as I do!"

Leaving as quietly as they came, the three natives of Ayer get out of town, avoiding detection from the locals - they hope. In order to excite as little suspicion as possible, Jiro recommends re-entering town by the road. Despite their precautions, a beagle manages to chase them down en route. Nevertheless they continue walking - they are interested in people, not dogs.

Well, they are mostly interested in people. Leandra is interested in other things, too. The beagle earns a quick study, and she says, "Well, this one seems rather friendly, at least. Of course we being on his turf probably has him a bit on edge.. maybe a little something from my own stores will rectify that?" It seems like Jiro isn't going to wait, though, so the beagle's bribe will have to wait, instead.

By now, the barrelmaker - the sign on his front porch says 'Cooper', although whether this is his name, his profession, or both, is unclear - has caught on to his dogs excitement and comes out onto the porch to watch. He is a tall man, and lean, with vaguely polynesian features, and rough but clean clothes that look like they are made from a simple textile, probably cotton. His big hands are calloused but deft, like the hands of a craftsman, but one that works with unpowered tools. He whistles long and low as he spots the team. "Crikey, Lois, have a look at this!" He steps off the porch as the off-worlders approach and walks towards you. "Yer ride break down or somethin'? You musta walked all night!"

Jiro smiles politely, inclining his head in a respectful gesture he hopes is universal across cultures. "It's been a long trip," he agrees. "We're travelers, interested in learning more about your town here."

Archer twitches an eyebrow at that comment. _Interesting. He doesn't seem too surprised by our gear._

Leandra will remain quiet for now. She's not sure yet what to make of things. Calling upon her vast lack of practical experience in first contact with primitive cultures, she decides to remain attentive but not too attentive. She's simply a woman from out of town, seeing what sights there are to see in this place. There aren't many, though, so her study is rather short.

The man starts for a moment, then guffaws. "Sadie! Heel!", he calls, and the Beagle retreats and swarms excitedly around his ankles. "What the 'ell for, mate? Nothin' here but trees. No need to be coy about it, you want to do business with Heath, he'll want to do business with you. Dunno why you'd come all the way from Holiday for that, he'd as soon have come to you if you've got the gow to throw at him!"

Jiro gestures vaguely in the direction the trees were found. "The crops around here are odd.. Like they've been altered by something," he explains. "We've seen similar things elsewhere, and came here to see if we could learn the source."

Almost as if summoned by his name, the front door on the large house bangs open. A shorter, swarther man, with caucasian features and missing most of his hair, hurries out towards where Cooper and the team are standing. "'Ere! Don't go defaming my good name, Cooper!

The man, who must be Heath, puffs to a halt. "Welcome to Poplar Gulch! I'm Heath, and we grow the best softwoods on the island! I see my reputation must have reached you in Holiday! Follow me! I'll be glad to tell you whatever you want to know!" He gestures back towards his house. Cooper has a bemused look on his face.

Archer gives Jiro a 'now you've done it' look.

Leandra considers for a moment, but decides it best not to break away to speak with others in the city. She isn't sure what story Jiro is going to be spinning, and now she's thinking she should have planned something with him before. That way she could be helping out by talking to others in the city. Still, she may be of use here, if she pays attention.

Breakfast is served inside Heath's house. The portly man, his wife, three young children, two dogs, several cats, and several dozen pounds of food are also in attendance. Heath alternates between small talk, and tries to direct the conversation towards the sale of his lumber.

One of Leandra's curiosities is answered almost immediately, as Heath brags about the lineage of his trees - "Yes sirs, my father made a deal with the Coulam to make us a breed of poplar that would grow to maturity in half the time of any other variety in this soil! With their tinkering, the extra alkalai content actually works to our advantage, and we can breed from a sapling to maturity in just twelve years! This is our third generation on this plantation and we're planning for a major harvest this year, prolly need to hire a dozen diesels to cart it all off!"

"That would explain the differences we saw," confesses Jiro. "I'm more of a people person than a tree person. But tell me more about the Coulam - do you need their intervention to keep growing the trees? Will they have to do something special with any finished product that gets made out of them?" He attempts to cast these questions in a light suggesting fear of further expense.

Somewhere in the sales pitch, Heath's youngest daughter is tugging at his wife's apron springs. "Mommy... the lady with them!" The mother shusses her daughter and gives a embarassed wink to Leandra.

Leandra nods to Heath's wife and offers a calm smile to the child. She imagines this means that her secret is no secret at all. Still, that alone is worth something. The relationship with the Coulam seems to be amiable.

Heath says, "Oh, no, no, no, mister... uh... sorry, I didn't catch your name... no, the finished product is totally stable. Tree's just another log, once you cut it down." He pauses, and then hurridly adds, "You won't be able to grow these half as well anywhere else, though. I mean, they're tailored for _right here_. If you're looking to start the breed somewhere else, you better go to the Coulam and ask them to have a look at your farm."

Jiro shakes his head and smiles, rising and indicating for Leandra to join him. "I'm afraid I've already gone to them," he explains, and gestures for Leandra to reveal herself. "I apologize if I've misled you about our intentions here. At this time, we can't really purchase wood. But for your hospitality, I'd like to repay you in some way."

Heath looks crestfallen. "Ah, damn. Well, I could tell you didn't have much interest in trees. City slickers don't often care much for annular density as much as they do for the bottom line." He sits back. "You... uh... mentioned some variety of repayment?"

Jiro nods slowly. "We don't have a lot of time, but if it is possible."

Leandra does as Jiro says, pushing her hair behind her ears to fully reveal her race. "Is there someone who is ill that you would wish to get healthy, sir?" she asks quietly. "Perhaps I can repay you, if there is. I am grateful for your courtesy, and you have such a charming family."

Heath stands and bows to Leandra, as she removes her hood. "I thought you might be from the Coulam! But I figger, if you're keeping a secret, you've got your own reasons." He thinks for a moment. "No... none as are ill right now... but... if you happen to have some panicillin?" He looks quite hopeful. "Nearest doctor is in Appleton, up the road, and that kinda thing goes for quite a few gow out here! Might save us a lot of trouble, next time Junior get a chest cold!"

Archer chuckles. "If I understand things correctly, I don't think it works on colds, Mr. Heath. But you can give him my share, Leandra... you know I'm allergic to it."

"Yes, antibiotics are of no use against a virus," says Leandra. "But if you would allow me to examine your child, perhaps I might find the cause of his problems. It seems this is a persistant issue, from what you say."

Junior is a scrawny kid of maybe eight years old. He sits quietly while Leandra examines him, trying not to stare at the points on her ears. His eyes get as wide as saucers when she pulls out her diagnostic scanners - for that matter, so does everyone else's. But nobody says anything, and Leandra is quickly able to isolate the cause - a persistent fungal infection in the boy's lungs, which has probably been there for several years. Panicillin won't cure it, but a slightly higher-tech derivative will.

Leandra smiles when she completes the careful examination, then draws out her kit, examing its contents carefully before selecting just the course of medicine required. "You have a rather stubborn fungal infection there, Junior," says Leandra. "But I have just the thing." She turns to offer the medicine to Heath, "He should take two of these a day. Probably easiest if you just give one at breakfast and one a few hours before he goes to bed at night. This should be done for 21 days."

Heath stares at the small bottles of pills for a few moments, and then takes a long, surprised look at Leandra and the others. "I'm in your debt," he states, somewhat hollowly, "Again..." He sighs. "So ...I imagine you'll want to be going now?"

Archer glances at the others, and back to Heath. "Well... perhaps, and perhaps not. Jiro, d'you think...?"

"It's probably for the best that we do," says Jiro. "You see, something happened, a hundred years ago. We have a few things that came from the time before that, as you've seen.." Here he gestures at Leandra's medkit. "We're trying to understand the secrets behind it all. What would be the fastest way to get back to Holiday?"

Archer says nothing more, willing to follow the diplomat's lead on this.

Leandra ruffles Junior's hair playfully and puts away her things with the same care as she always uses. Inwardly she's sighing, of course. She'd rather have healed him completely right now. She also wonders if she would rather have done so for the good of the child, or for her own pride. The thought does not stop her smile. "You'll feel much better soon," she promises.

The small boy just nods. His fascinated gaze travels between Leandra, her medkit, and the bottle of pills his father holds.

Heath thinks a moment. "I can take you there in my diesel. We can get there by tonight." He weighs the small bottle of pills in his hand, and then says, "If I don't have to save up for Doc Tybalt, then I can afford to burn the fuel."

Jiro nods slowly. "If you'll excuse us a moment, then, I think we want to discuss our next move. I appreciate everything you've done for us." With that, he moves to step outside, beckoning his comrades to join him.

After a few short minutes of discussion outside, Jiro peeks his head back in. "We'd very much appreciate a lift," he says.

It takes a little while for Heath to get his 'diesel', as he calls it, ready. The machine is a battered farm truck, with a small cab for two and a cargo area that could seat four, or carry quite a bit of gear. It definitely was not typical for New Queensland before the crash. It's powered by some kind of rotary diesel engine that was probably scavenged from a higher-tech piece of equipment. The large, knobby tires are perfect for the kind of uneven ground you'll be passing over. Of particular note is that there are no electical or electronic devices anywhere on the truck - not even headlights.

Heath loads several 20-liter canisters into the truck bed. They smell like they contain alcohol, and the oddly sweet exhaust of the machine seems to bear out that hypothesis. It's quiet, as combustion engines go, and soon you are bumping down the dirt road at a pretty good clip. Most of the farms around here seem to be orchards, or other plantations specializing in trees. The smell of fruits, especially apples, overpowers the smell of the machine.

Archer waits for a moment in the small talk. "What do you do if you're caught out after dark?"

Heath shrugs. "Enh. I don't get to drive that often. Fuel's kinda expensive for a tree-farmer, like to save it for the harvest. If I do have to go somewhere I just leave in the morning and get back by nightfall."

Heath continues, directing his comment at Leandra, "You know, M'Lady, if you needed my help, you could have just asked. We're good people. We pay back our favors. Even if Dad's dead I'd honor his debt to you, there was no need to get a new one on me."

Leandra is startled out of her inward debate of guilt by Heath's words of gratitude. "Every time your child takes in a healthy breath I will be repaid completely," she replies. "I do not demand payment for anything I do. So my people have helped your father? Or do you mean with the trees?"

Heath says, "Well, with the trees, of course. It was the usual deal, they engineered our trees, we agree to do sustainable agriculture only, give back a percentage to help the other refugees... not as many of those now as when he got started thirty years ago, thank Christi, but we still have a long way to go. I just hope you lot can figure out how to fix the sun. Every time it dims I gotta think that we're staring armageddon in the face. Now I know how all those poor bastards back in the 1900's felt, with all those nukes. Never know which day's gonna be the last."

Archer's ears practically twitch at that. "You're a student of history, Mr. Heath?"

Heath looks at Leandra for a long moment, ignoring his driving, before looking back at the road. "I know you never call people on it, but the favor of the Coulam is better than Gau. There's lots as would take and not give back. But me dad was one o' the refugees. Without the Coulam, they'd be dead. And I wouldn't be here."

"I did go to school, Mister Collins," Heath states. "Those were Interesting Times, as they say. The last days before space flight. I hope we get to go back someday." He guffaws. "Crazy thing for a tree-farmer to say! Most days, I can't get enough fuel for me diesel here! Not going on any rocket rides in my lifetime!"

Leandra nods, "We will do whatever we can to save this world," she says softly. She falls silent after that, not sure what else to say.

Archer chuckles. "Ah, but apparently you _listened_ in school, Mr. Heath. There's many that don't, and more that try to forget it again as soon as they get out."

Heath's diesel bumps along through progressively larger towns. The next one, Appleton, has a population of nearly a thousand. By noon, you've reached a suburb of Holiday, which looks like it might support ten thousand, and has streets paved in cobblestones. Once Heath reaches a road paved in asphalt, he's able to cover the last 50km to Holiday in just an hour. It's a sprawling city, more wide than tall. The buildings range between one and four stories tall and cover an area some thirty kilometers across in a semi-circular arrangment centered on the large harbor downtown.

There is little agriculture within city limits, and the city is a bustle of urban activity. Ground cars in dozens of different styles, some as battered as Heath's, some newer, fill the streets. Blue-uniformed constables direct traffic at major interesections. Many of the streets have gaslamps that are currently unlit. A lot of the buildings seem to serve either residential or industrial needs - apartment buildings, factories, workshops, and warehouses.

Heath navigates his way carefully through the city, stopping once or twice to ask directions from passerby. Finally he arrives at a block that might be public park. A carved stone sign in front proclaims 'Embassy of Coulam'. There is no fence, but low stone obelisks surround the block and clearly demarcate the line between the green Coulam area, and the bustling industrial city.

Heath gets out of the truck and begins tipping the cans of alcohol into his fuel tank. "Well. Figger'd this is where you'd want to go. Feel free to drop in on Poplar Gulch if you ever come out our way again. 'Fraid I have to get back and tend to my family, so... if there's nothing else?"

Jiro shakes his head, and offers a hand to the tree-farmer. "You've been a great help to us," he says with conviction.

Leandra bows to Heath. "Thank you for your help, sir. Perhaps when my other tasks have been seen to I can return and wander in your tree garden for a time. It would be nice to just listen to the wind there. For now, though, take care and be well."

Archer makes a note to himself. _And if it's at all possible, we'll get you your rocket ride, too._

Heath shakes Jiro's hand. "I dunno who you lot are," he says, "But I hope you find what you're lookin' for. And keep me in mind if you ever need timber." He makes a casual salute to Archer and a bow to Leandra, and climbs back into his truck. In a few minutes he's out of sight around the corner of a busy street.
