# Synthetic Saints 2004-10-21

Team Aurora is standing on an empty sidewalk next to a verdant block in the middle of the otherwise bustling downtown of the city of Holiday, on the island of Tasmania on New Queensland. In contrast the bustle of the pre-electrical industrial city around them, the Embassy of Coulam is flowering and verdant. Small granite obelisks, perhaps a foot high, mark the perimeter at intervals of about three meters. Between two of these obelisks, a footpath paved with marblesque cobblestones leads onto the grounds.

Archer looks around. "Well... there's a path. I'd think it would be polite to stay on it as we go in. Otherwise we might get attacked by a rabid cabbage or something."

"Well, here we are," Leandra murmurs. For all her expectation of this moment, she's suddenly rather uncertain. Archer's comment manages to break her nervous concentration, fortunately. "Yes, you know how the Coulam are always making fierce vegetation. Like our legumes of doom, for instance." Perhaps she's feeling ill. Unless she's trying to cultivate a sense of humor. "You are quite right, however. It is best to stay on the path for now. Let's see what we may see." And so she will take the first step, heading into the embassy.

Archer tags along behind her with Jiro.

The footpath curves gently between the low-hanging branches of several willow trees, modified for survival in the subtropical ocean environment. After walking fifteen meters or so, the explorers see a small gazebo-like hut. A young Coulam in a grey robe with white bands around his waist and wrists is seated inside, reading a leatherbound book.

Leandra leads the way towards the young man, holding her sudden excitement in check. She'll find out a lot about these Coulam soon enough, it seems. And it would appear the time for hiding the truth about herself has passed. Here they will know rather quickly that she's from a long ways off. At least she suspects they will. When she draws close enough, she will politely bow to the young man. "Good day to you," she calls out clearly.

The young man startles at your approach. He looks up and takes note of the newcomers. His jaw drops for just a moment when he sees Leandra, but he regains his composure quickly. He closes the book and places it on the bench, and walks out into the middle of the path. He keeps a distance of about five meters, and bows at the waist, hands folded in the sleeves of his robes, keeping his eyes on the explorers. "Well met, m'lady," he says. "Forgive us for not having a proper greeting prepared. We were not notified of your coming. If I might ask, what canton has sent you to us?"

Leandra answers truthfully enough, "I come from Ayer," she says simply. She was prepared for this moment, thankfully. Most Coulam always carry their markings when they are at their homes. Which is almost all the time, of course. Leandra hasn't carried hers very often on this voyage, but brought it along, imagining that this moment would come. The marking is not a great deal to look at for the average man, but to the Coulam it's length of colored bands and skillfully crafted patterns speaks volumes about the one who bears it. Test scores, the ages attached to various milestones, and even a considerable amount of genetic information is provided indicating the relative health of the bearer. "I can not imagine that any Coulam would forget what this means," she says, indicating a particular band. The healer's band, indicating her special gift.

Unobtrusively Jiro's hand falls near his belt, where his sword rests. It is less a conscious decision than the natural result of his training and inner character. His eyes flicker left and right, while Leandra speaks.

Archer suppresses the urge to glance at the surrounding vegetation. He hasn't gotten one of his 'feelings' yet, but he knows someone's out there. _Probably a standard precaution, and Jiro's seen them too. No need to disrupt anything yet._

The young man approaches, cautiously. "Ayer," he says, as if he has not heard the word before. "I... don't believe that I have heard of that one. Is it in the northern reaches?" He eyes are scanning the bands on Leandra's markers. He looks puzzled by many of them, clearly impressed by some. Finally he takes a good, long look at Leandra's face, making no effort to conceal the confusion on his own. "Forgive my failure of decorum, Lady. I am Selkirk, apprenticed to Aldous Greyrobe. Might I know your name?"

"Leandra Cal Maratain ve Maraan," answers Leandra calmly. "I am not from this planet, Selkirk," she adds. "These are my friends Jiro and Archer. We hope we have not come at a troubling time." She indicates her friends as they are named and waits to see how the other Coulam reacts.

Archer clears his throat. "We're not from a local, uh, canton. The planet Ayer. 55 Cancri 4."

Selkirk's short black hair frames fine, elfin features that are a mask of confusion, mixed with trepidation. "There have been no travellers from off-world in over one hundred years. If what you say is true... 55 Cancri... that's light-years away..." He stands bolt upright. "You came by Stargate?" There is excitement in his voice. He calls to the bushes, where Archer and Jiro noticed several someones lying in wait. "Summon Greyrobe!"

At least one of the waiting figures, is no longer waiting. After a moment, you can hear someone running off down a path that is out of sight. Selkirk continues. "Aldous Greyrobe will be with us presently. Please join me in the gazebo. I will do my best to make the delay pleasant." He motions with one hand towards the hut where he was waiting. It has wrought-iron furniture and simple canvas cushions similar to those the explorers saw in the gardens of the Greyrobes on Ayer.

"There is no need to rush," says Leandra. "We will not vanish with the next gust of wind. At least I don't think I've lost that much weight." She smiles and turns her mind to putting Selkirk, "So how long have you been an apprentice?" she asks.

You make small talk for a few minutes. Selkirk has been apprenticed as an Intercessor for six years, and has just completed his first summer as a gatekeeper at this Embassy. You gather that most of those who come and go are either local residents, or refugees. "Eighty years ago, most of the refugees seeking the help of the Coulam, came to us directly," he says at one point. "Now, there are many branches of Coulam, and refugees that arrive here have likely been in our care for some time." He inquires politely about Leandra's family - which, in Coulam, can be quite a complicated matter of genetics, and greets Archer and Jiro. He seems more at ease with the spacer, and less at ease with the Exiler soldier. Finally, he says, "May I ask, Jiro? You... are not Australite? You do not speak as one."

Jiro shakes his head. "I am from a different ethnic branch," he explains. "On Earth, the Asia-Pacific cultures." Gesturing with a hand, he indicates his companions. "I do not speak like them, or look quite like them, but like them I am also a human being light-years away from my homeworld, for the moment. We are alike in the ways that matter."

Selkirk nods, and at last smiles in honesty. "I mistook you for one of our Missionaries, Leandra Cal Maratain ve Maraan. They often travel with such irregular companions. Those who know the world outside our protected walls." A moment later, Aldous Greyrobe arrives. He is the spitting image of Vedus Greyrobe on Ayer, save for his bright red hair. Selkirk rises and confers with his master. You can overhear his excited whispers. "Sir... I believe they speak the truth! The woman with them, Leandra, I have never seen many of her markers!"

Greyrobe smiles and nods politely, and pats Selkirk on the shoulder. "You have done well. Now, sit at my right hand as we speak."

Selkirk's fine eyebrows nearly shoot through his hairline. "Sir?!"

Greyrobe says simply, "I am teaching you diplomacy, young one. You must learn to be at ease in the presence of the unknown, especially if they are, as you believe, our family."

Archer smiles at that, feeling a bit relieved. Aldous seems to be too kind and concerned to be anything other than honorable.

Greyrobe ascends the steps of the Gazebo and bows to Leandra. "Greetings to you, Leandra Cal Maratain ve Maraan. I am Aldous, Greyrobe of the Canton of Holiday. Forgive me for asking our Watchers to tell me what they hear and believe. You make some extraordinary claims in a dangerous world. So I invite you to convince me of them." He smiles honestly. "You are a scientist. You must understand, then, I must ask that extraordinary claims be accompanied by extraordinary proof. Especially because I want to believe you."

He also bows to Archer and Jiro. "Greetings also to our guests. I am told your names are Archer and Jiro. I see that the Coulam of Ayer have discovered the wisdom of finding companions from beyond our walls."

Archer says, "Ayer isn't fully terraformed yet, and we have different cultures living in different arcologies. We do try to use each other's strengths to cover our own weaknesses, at least when the politicians don't get in the way."

Jiro inclines his head politely at the greeting. In silent answer to the request for evidence, he unfolds the flap covering his rocket pistol and withdraws the weapon, then breaks open one of the magazines and extends it and the pistol for inspection.

Four humanoid figures, clad in black and lithe as cats, are instantly at the four corners of the gazebo. Greyrobe quickly raises his hand, as if he knew they would approach. "Hold," he cries. "See - the magazine is withdrawn."

"I only ask that you return it when you are satisfied," says Jiro. "I will retain my sword as my rank permits, but aside from it, no weapon is needed in the house of a trusted host."

Selkirk, to his credit, does not faint. Greyrobe stands and approaches Jiro, taking careful grip of the ultra-tech device.. "It is... odd... Watcher. Approach. Tell me what you make of this."

Jiro takes a step back, his body language radiating calm and patience.

One of the lithe forms steps up onto the gazebo, removing a gauzy black hood. Unlike most of the Coulam, he is bald - indeed, he has no facial hair of any kind. "A missing link of sorts, sir," he says. "Obsolete long before the coming of the Bug. But beyond our current level of manufacturing." He fingers the magazine. "The programming will tell. If it is from here, there will be markers in the code - the old legal protocols. He turns to face Jiro, reflecting some of the Exile's demeanor. "Destructive as this machine is, I daresay that you would not surrender it, unless you were still quite armed, sir. With or without your sword."

"I would betray the trust my comrades have in me if I were unarmed, sir," Jiro replies equitably. "For I am their Watcher."

Leandra considers these Coulam closely, and for the most par, quietly. These Coulam are proving more and more unlike her people. Perhaps it is a matter of interbreeding with other races? Still, they seem to be avoiding the topic of her markings. She's prepared to prove every last one, if need be.

The Watcher nods. "I am Escobar," he says, as he retreats to his post. "Believe them, Greyrobe. This one would not accompany liars."

Greyrobe nods. "Very well. One last piece of empirical evidence, then. Leandra, may we have a blood sample for a genopsy?"

"Of course," says Leandra. She offers her arm to Greyrobe as if it were the most normal thing in the world. There is a running joke on Ayer that the Coulam there know the blood type of their girl friends before they know their name. There's a measure of truth to it, too.

Greyrobe produces a syrette and draws a sample quickly, which he gives to Selkirk. "You know where to take this." The young man nods, and hurries off out of sight. "And now, my friends," Greyrobe states, "I can show you to comfortable surroundings. Normally that would be in an isolation ward in the Dock... but in this city, our entire milieu is, essentially, the Dock, so isolation is not necessary." He turns and leads the way down the path. The four Watchers quickly fade into the foliage.

The genopsy that Greyrobe spoke of is completed rapidly. Selkirk comes to the Aurora Team's quarters, practically bursting with excitement, and leads them to a bungalow made of wood and a bamboo-like material, lit by sunlight reflected off anarrangment of mylar banners in the cieling. A dozen Coulam are seated in a circle around the room - some on the floor, some on wooden chairs, some on piles of cushions. Greyrobe himself seems to be acting as the master of ceremonies, and introduces the travellers.

The discussion continues for some time. Every so often, one of the Coulam gets up to adjust the banners to keep the room lit. When the sun finally sinks below the hills to the west, attendants bring in lamps burning some kind of vegetable oil.

One of the first questions is about the lack of electrical devices. The Coulam explain the anomoly. "Most electronic devices on this world are scrap," Greyrobe begins. "Compromised by the Bug. That includes many generating devices, so we had to start from scratch. Fifty years ago, when Holiday started to grow, we built a power plant. Within weeks, it was destroyed by an EMP of some kind. So... we keep our electrical devices hidden underground, or within faraday cages, to keep the Bug from detecting and destroying it."

Archer nods. "The Crystal Entity. We discovered on the space stations both here and at Dromedary, and in an isolated station on Ayer itself, crystalline growths on the old computer systems which are apparently sentient and somewhat malicious."

Another Coulam, an older woman with red hair similar to Greyrobe's and angular cheekbones, adds, "We have taught the survivors how to live without wasting energy. Electricity is a luxury good amongst us. It is produced and used only as needed, and never when there is an alternative." She frowns. "It appears that this practice also avoids attracting the attention of the Entity of which you speak. Greyrobe... I am uncomfortable playing into the hands of a being that seeks to limit our potential. Have we made a mistake?"

Jiro offers a question of his own. "I don't suppose anyone had the foresight to record the time of day or night that the EMP occurred?"

Escobar smiles. "I see what Captain Uzuki intends. It was in the evening, just after sunset. Either we can find a stopped watch from that day, or we can calculate based on the day of the year."

Archer says, "More than once?"

Greyrobe shakes his head. "Not here. But other places. The expedition to Echo Bay kept in touch by radio... for a while. Fortunately they took a sailing vessel and were able to return unpowered."

Leandra is one to understand coincidences are rarely as random as they might seem. "Always just after sunset," she observes. "That would make sense. During those times signals are more easily bounced off the ionosphere. It would seem the Entity knows its business quite well, wouldn't it?"

Archer snaps his fingers as Leandra jogs his memory. "Of course. The Heaviside Layer. Local dusk is when the signals would travel and alert the Crystal. And it reacts, as usual, maliciously."

The topic rapidly turns to another solar-related event - the dimming of the Delta Cancri. It appears that it has been going on for some time. "We remember the first taking place fifty-two years ago," Greyrobe states. "Averaging about once a week ever since. Sometimes several times in a week, sometimes an entire month would pass without any. It doesn't seem to be linked to any natural solar cycle... so..." He shrugs. "It's gotten cooler here. We knew of no phenomenon that could dim a star. The more religiously-inclined attributed it to divine intervention." His expression sours. "It seems they were right. An angry crystalline god."

Archer nods. "We had a long conversation with one ... node of the Crystal, and a much more useful conversation with an entity it had summoned by a very odd manipulation of the Stargate. The hyperspace mind told us that the Crystal seems to be responsible for the fluctuations in your sun."

Eventually, the Coulam speak of the fate of their original home on Fraser's Island. "It seems your 'entity' does not want us to go there," the red-headed woman begins bitterly. "Of course, our Colony survived the Bug, because we do not infest our world with machines. But..." She sighs. "Machines rained down on us from the skies. Re-entry junk. It seemed quite odd that it should always fall on Fraser's, particularly on the south half of the island, where the Republic maintained its embassy. Eventually we abandoned it, rather than allow the biosphere to be pelted to death."

Jiro speaks up again. "Did the Coulam have access to the Embassy prior to their departure?"

Escobar speaks again. "We were no more or less invited than any other people. Still, we go back, at least once a year, to perform reconnaisance. The entrance to the Embassy has remained sealed since the Bug came. It asks for access codes that we do not have. We do not have the tools to coerce the gates into opening. If we are cautious, and stay for a short time in structures no larger than tents, we do not invite the rain of junk."

Archer says, "Hmm. We can get there quickly, but from what you say, it would be very dangerous. The shuttle would undoubtedly be a target. Is the Crystal in the Embassy? Or does it simply want to keep us out?"

Archer shakes his head. "I'm thinking out loud. I know you don't know."

Escobar shakes his head. "I've never seen anything like the crystal brains you describe. The forest re-grows quickly after the meteors, but... we've been all over the island in the last one hundred years. I'm sure a quartz obelisk would have been noted. If I had to guess... either something in the Embassy wants to remain undisturbed, or your 'entity' does not want us to have something that is in the embassy." He smiles toothily, exposing teeth that look vaguely feline - although perhaps it's just the light. "I think, my friends, that in either case, it is in our interests to discover what it is."

The council continues until after midnight. The Coulam ask many more questions, about Schwarzgeist, about Ayer, and about the state of the Stargates, and about returning to space. The council reconvenes the next day, and once again the Aurora team is asked to attend. "This may go without saying," Greyrobe begins, "but you must be careful how you use your machinery, especially above ground. It may be very dangerous for you to use your shuttlecraft. However..."

Archer nods. "I'd suspected that from the first. This area had too high a technology to be ignorant of electricity. I assumed there was another reason for its absence."

He rubs his temples. "As you probably know, Mister Collins, the Coulam have a reserved attitude towards technology. We use only what we need. When the Bug came, we taught the other survivors to live the same way." He sighs. "And in so doing, perhaps we have committed a sin of pride. Played into the thing's hands, telling ourselves that we were teaching humanity 'the right way' to live." He pauses. "We have been speaking at length. It is odd, that when we did not have a name and a face to put on the Bug, that we were willing to assume it was a blind quirk of fate, and live with the misfortune. But now that we do... well... many of us are unwilling to remain bound under it.

Greyrobe continues, "We have not yet informed the Australites of your presence. We leave that to your discretion. If your intention is to confront Schwarzgeist, we will aid you. There are few that will interfere with you when you travel with our banner."

Archer waves a hand at the sun. "I think it is becoming necessary. The Crystal wants to do something that is draining your star of its life. If you ignore it much longer, it could do irreparable harm to your ecosystem."

Archer sighs. "And the hyperspace entity's information and our own analysis seems to indicate that it will keep trying in spite of an innate inability to do what it desires. Schwarzgeist is insane."

Greyrobe nods. "Then we must cure it, or banish it, for we have no asylum to protect us from each other."
