# Synthetic Saints 2004-10-28

It is the day after the Aurora team reached the Coulam canton in the city of Holiday, on the island of Tasmania. Now, just a day and a half after they've arrived, they're already on their way back to the Walkabout for an expedition to Fraser's Island. Weather reports indicate a storm is brewing that should cover the shuttle's tracks. The Coulam find an diesel truck heading back towards Poplar Gulch, and assign Escobar to watch over the crew while they travel.

The trip back to the small farming hamlet goes without incident, although dusk is gathering when the team reaches the end of the unimproved road. Excuses are made to Heath and Cooper, and everyone marches off into the back country towards the Walkabout's landing site. It's about 7pm local time when you return. Oi is still inside, examining sensor logs, searching for radio traffic, and so on. The hacker only left the ship long enough to throw a camoflague net over it. "It isn't natural to breathe the air without a mask," is all he says.

The flight to Fraser's Island takes about three hours. Archer does his best to use the weather patterns to mask the emissions of the Walkabout from any watchers in orbit. The shuttle descends from the clouds amidst cold wind and rain. Fraser's Island looms below, six hundred miles long and three hundred at its widest point. The dagger-shaped piece of land narrows to a point at its northern end, at the site of the old Coulam city. The island is heavily forested; any old impact craters are overgrown with trees. The southern half of the island is mountainous. One particular peak, Fraser's Matterhorn, stands above all the others - the charts show the peak to be eleven thousand feet above sea level.

The entrance to the Republican Embassy is in an alpine meadow halfway up the side of the Matterhorn. The indestructible landing pads and roadways are clear, in stark contrast to the vegetation that has sprung up around them. Where once the lawns were carefully manicured, now there are wildflowers and stories-tall conifers growing.

Archer angles the shuttle for a VTOL landing. The Walkabout settles onto the pad in the usual howl of thrusters. Some of the noise continues as the engines shut down, as rain pelts the exterior of the craft. Thunder rumbles in the distance outside. The blast doors of the Embassy entrance are four hundred meters away, and even at this distance, they are an imposing sight - a gigantic slab of polished black marble, gleaming slightly in the gathering dusk, inscribed with a simple, perfect white ring.

Archer says, "First order of business is to get the camouflage netting up. If we have a net that matches the color of the surface, that is."

Outside, Jiro spends time working on the camouflage tarp. He's not really satisfied with the outcome, and he spends a few extra minutes trying to improve matters. Once he returns to the shuttle interior, he talks to Oi quietly for a minute or two, then brings up another point: "We need a Faraday cage or something similar near the entrance. There's a possibility that Schwarzgeist will still be attempting to break into the Embassy electronically. Opening the front door, or tampering with the security apparatus, may give it an opening."

Oi adjusts the AESA on the shuttle to jam signals in the immediate area. "Can't do a full faraday cage, but this should overpower anything that makes it this far. Assuming that Tall, Dark, 'n' Gruesome isn't already waiting inside with his Little Grey men."

Archer says, "It'll also announce our presence in glowing neon letters. Let's be quick."

The team alights from the shuttle, wearing the monocrys liners from their space suits as armor. The light rain splatters off their visors, promising to become heavier very soon. The exceptions are Jiro, who tromps out of the hull in his fighting suit, and Escobar, who wears his form-fitting black Coulam Watcher outfit, with the addition of a long hooded poncho made from the same slick material.

Oi twiddles at a keypad on his wrist. "Maybe I should leave it off until we get the door open, then?"

Jiro nods. "Of course."

The portal the the embassy is, as expected, sealed. Inspection of the twenty-meter edifice reveals that it is smooth and seamless. File photos show that the giant marble slab seperates horizontally in several sections, parts of the bottom half retracting into the ground, like a row of giant teeth. There is no other entrance apparent. The paved path leads directly up to the marble wall, and ends.

Escobar says, "This is as close as anyone has been in a hundred years. There's an access panel over there, that we've never been able to gimmick." He points to a protrusion from the rock face. Oi quickly finds the hinges for the hidden panel and tugs it open. Even after a hundred years, the panel swings open easily and noislessly. The young hacker rubs his hands together and then runs cables into the panel. "OK... open wide, because Doctor Oi is drilling."

Escobar murmurs to Leandra, "That's your technician? Is he always so glib?"

"He is surprisingly capable," says Leandra, sounding strangely defensive of Oi. "He has taught me a great deal about how to view the world." Mostly lessons that he had no idea he was teaching, of course. "If anyone can get us into a place where someone else would not wish us to be, he can."

"Aha," Oi shouts, less than a minute later. "Brilliant defensive strategy! Speak the Word 'Friend', and press Enter!" he triumphantly strikes a button inside the access panel... and nothing happens. Oi looks perplexed.

Archer quirks an eyebrow. "Wrong language?"

While the others attend to their respective tasks, Jiro begins running his own sensors. While his comsuite runs across the electromagnetic spectrum, scanning for transmissions from the hostile entity, he studies the surroundings using passive sensors, in case the Embassy has more active defenses that are warming up.

"Umm... no," Oi reports. "No power. This doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense... our scans from orbit indicated that there's a fusor of at least a megawatt operating on the premises. But there's no power to the door." He pulls out a tool and tries to pry open the panel further. "Umm... Jiro? Can I get a hand here?"

Jiro easily prys the access panel free from the rock face, exposing a thick bundle of cables. Oi returns to the shuttle for a moment to retrieve a power cell, and improvises emergency power to the door. He taps at his keypad, and finally, something happens.

"The door can be unpowered, and the fusor can be here, if the power to the door was deliberately severed," suggests Jiro, idly, as he stands back while Oi continues working.

There is a momentary groan, and a snap, as the central section of the great marble wall retracts into the ground, leaving a gap three meters wide and as many tall. As the doorway opens, it also exhales forth a brief white cloud of vapor, as the pressure inside and outside the mountain equalizes. Inside there is only darkness.

Archer says, "Bring the power cell along, we might need it again." He shines a flashlight into the opening. "Anyone home?"

"Hold on a moment," says Leandra. She looks at her scanners. "Interesting.. very interesting. Until that door opened the inside was a mixture of seventy percent nitrogen and thirty percent argon." She frowns thoughtfully. Very curious.

Jiro claps Oi lightly on the shoulder. "Well done," he says; his smile cannot be seen behind the Templar's armor he wears. And doing his job, the Exile takes the first step forward. His AESA switches over to high-resolution ladar; alternating between this and his other sensors, he leads the way inside. Should anything unexpected spring out, he prays it will find him first.

Escobar frowns. "Then I suppose I will watch our tails," he says, and pulls an odd-looking breathing mask out of a belt pouch. He does not draw a weapon, but drops into a cautious and watchfal stance.

Archer frowns. "Now what the hey... There's light deep in, maybe a hundred meters." He snaps off his torch, watching to see if it changes.

Jiro stops several steps in. "Oi," he calls back, "there's power further in. Take a moment and see if you can find the junction that feeds power to the door? Also, there's some sort of graphic up ahead."

"Preservation seems the likely reason, I suppose," murmurs Leandra. Though she thinks that seems almost too simple. Ever since this voyage of discovery started she's found the simplest answers suspect. "In any case, we'll not be breathing the air inside."

Oi plods cautiously into the interior of the mountain, tightening the straps on his breathing mask. He shines his flashlight casually around the entryway, a corridor a hundred meters long, four high, and twenty wide. He quickly locates an access panel in a wall. "It's intact," he says. "But there's no power to it. Whatever's feeding your graphic must be on a different circuit." He begins wiring the power cell into the panel. "Open, or closed, folks?"

Jiro shakes his head. "Don't change anything yet," he replies. "My instinct is that this place was deliberately mothballed; I'm just looking for confirmation." And so saying, he moves further ahead, toward the glow.

The hallway, four meters tall and twenty wide, leads a hundred meters from the entryway to the main gallery, The main gallery of the embassy is cavernous, easily ten stories tall and a hundred meters across. Each level is ringed with balconies; only shadows indicate halls that lead further into the depths of the mountain. The only illumination comes from the wide floor, the size of several football fields, that appears to be a map of the Delta Cancri star system. Representations of the planets glow in sharp contrast to the glassy black floor, which makes no noise at all. The center of the map is occupied by a black hemispherical dome, five meters tall, where the star Delta Cancri would be.

Leandra takes her time surveying the building before she begins to share what she can. "If this is a normal facility we'll find the most public of areas on the lower levels. There should be banks of elevators which probably now do not receive power. We may encounter numerous robots. When this embassy was active there would likely have been several protocol droids present on this level. As for the many rumors that surrounded these places.. well, perhaps we may find if there is any truth in them with a closer inspection."

Oi tinkers with the panel. "Damn odd. This whole place should be producing radio echoes like crazy. But it's quiet in here. Almost like someone built the walls to... hide from sensors. Which I guess was the point."

Archer says, "Radio absorbing walls? Hmmm."

Escobar stalks noiselessly up to the end of the corridor, staying close to Leandra. "Rumors and secrets... after a hundred years you could find a large number of people that belive God himself lives here. And an equal number that would say the Devil."

Archer says, "I'm beginning to suspect it was an AI. No one ever knew quite what the Shining One was."

You can't tell what expression Oi has inside his mask, but it's clear that he's upset that he didn't think of that first. "'Ere, now, Arch. I'm the loony conspiracy theorist, yes?" He pauses. "But if you're right, does that mean he... umm... crashed?"

Archer says, "Maybe. Or maybe he was attacked by Schwarzgeist."

Jiro hums. "Oi, handle the power situation. Archer, you and I can work on getting the shuttle inside. If this place was proof against other attacks, this should be a good place for it."

Archer says, "We can do it, if we get enough of the door sections open..."

Leandra frowns at the mention of the Shining One being an AI. The thought that he 'crashed' makes her clench a fist. "Could we please save such foolish speculation until we have some real proof on the matter. This is hardly time for unfounded leaps in logic."

Archer chuckles to himself as he goes to see about getting the shuttle inside the complex. _I think I touched a nerve, there._

Archer taxis the shuttle to entrance to the mountain, while Jiro uses Oi's improvised power source to open the other sections of the door. It's slow going. Archer folds the wings to clear the walls with centimeters to spare, and by the time the craft lurches to a halt, it has grown completely dark outside, and the rain comes down the alpine meadow in sheets.

Leandra's mood is quickly improved when her search for a powered terminal yields something that tickles her fancy. With a little bit of work she begins to merrily adjust the position of planets and asteroids on the floor. "This one is active," she says finally, probably well after everyone realizes that fact from watching her.

Oi, who has been attempting to pick the lock on a stairwell, finally notices that a meter-sized silver ball on the floor has drifted right under him. The young hacker almost starts out of his skin. "Jeebus!" he stands up and looks frantically around the room, finally noticing Leandra's amusement.

Leandra gives Oi a wide grin when he finally realizes she's the guilty party. She seems pretty pleased with herself over that. Which only lasts long enough for her to realize that her silliness probably was noticed by Escobar. Ahem. Nothing to see here.

Archer says, "Y'know... don't bump any of those things into each other, Leandra. Just in case the machinery tries to make the solar system match the display."

Oi looks uncharacteristically ruffled as he walks back across the cavernous hall to where the shuttle is parked. "Just gonna go get a rope ladder. Be easier than gimmicking the stairs. I don't think they'd put the computer core on the first level, and I need to get into some of the power conduits."

Archer goes with Oi, just to make sure he doesn't get into too much trouble on his own.

Jiro spends a fair amount of time browsing the files cached inside the display control terminal. Even though it's a simple and limited machine, there's still some interesting material. Jiro discovers quite a large amount of the Republican beauracratic handbook, including procedures for processing refugees; apparently a small but steady trickle of asylum-seekers came to the Republic and were relocated from New Queensland to other worlds. He also finds several academic publications on astrophysics, that give predictions for the various bodies in Delta Cancri.

Leandra, meanwhile, explores the first level. The side corridors burrow off into the mountain for some distance on all sides. Some doors are open, some are closed and locked, and some rooms do not have doors. A few rooms close to the main gallery are packed full of dormant 'smart furniture' that would otherwise position itself as needed on the gallery floor. One large room west of the entrance is a well-stocked, high-tech emergency infirmary. Other closets and accessways have deactivated protocol droids. Remarkably, everything is almost entirely clean and free of dust.

Escobar stays near to Leandra, warily prodding the protocol droids as if expecting them to lurch to life. "Better than the corrupted menaces around Echo Bay," he mutters.

"For the moment they are silent, anyway," says Leandra. "Even if they were to wake, I don't think they would be armed." She will have to borrow Oi later so she can help herself to a full tour. As she and Escobar take their little stroll, she will ask him, "Could you tell me more about Echo Bay?"

Escobar nods. "The Coulam sponsored an expedition there. Thirty men and women, mostly Australites, with a few Watchers and Coulam diplomats. The EMP came a few days after we landed in Echo Bay. Our radio was a salvaged model, unfortunately, and vulnerable to the attack. A few days later... well..." He trails off. "A lot of the old automation came out of the ruins and did its best to do us in. At first it was just a few domestic drones, gone mad we thought. Later some Enforcers came... and we got out ahead of them." He rubs his shoulder. "Almost untouched."

Leandra nods slowly, considering. "Perhaps before we energize too many things in the embassy we should find all the robots and disable them. It is rather likely there are potentially dangers machines here, as well."

Escobar nods. "One thing I never understood, though. If the machines had wanted us dead... well... there would have been little that we could have done about it. I never shook the feeling that... well..." He pauses and leans against the wall, arms crossed while he thinks. "They let us go. They didn't want to kill us off so much as run us off." He looks over at Leandra. "From what you tell us of Schwarzgeist... it's like an insane God. Why would it have spared us then, or at all? I'm sure that if it could rain junk from the heavens on one island here, it could also do so elsewhere. There's the remains of a cylindrical habitat in near orbit, we've watched it through telescopes. One end of the tube is missing. It must weight many thousands of tons. If that struck Tasmania, there would be nothing left. I can't help but feel, when I think that, that perhaps Schwarzgeist wants us alive."

"It wants us alive, but only on its terms," says Leandra. "I do not know how much luck we will have finding out just what the entity's true motivations are. Perhaps it isn't sure what to do with us yet. If so, we might be able to tip the scales. It's impossible for us to say at this point what actions would forever tilt that balance. Even coming here is a risk. I am glad your people saw it as one worth taking."

Escobar nods. "I know that you think our ways are strange, divergent from the True Path, perhaps. But we are still Coulam. Schwarzgeist is an excessive machine. That alone is reason to come here."

Oi and Archer respond to a summons from Jiro, who has found discrepancies between two copies of the Beauracratic Handbookthat was cached in the terminal. "The low-order bits in the images are different... classic steganography. Almost too easy," he frowns. "By the way. This big light show here? It's not on the same power grid as the rest of the Embassy. It's probably being run by that reactor - maybe the only thing in the building that is. Well, that, and the terminal. I can rig power cells to the central computers if we can find them. Might take a while. But I wonder why they'd leave this particular porch light on? It's not like it's scrubbing the air or anything."

Jiro thinks a moment. "It's a harmless system," he says. "If the Embassy was mothballed, whoever did it wanted to leave behind a message - not too hard to break, not too easy to find, unless you were extremely curious. Like us. And there may be some significance to the astrophysics..."

Oi scratches his head. "Damn oblique way of leaving it, then. Must have played someone's Game, or they would have just left a note tacked to the door. 'Hello, we're out, bugger off.'"

Jiro holds out his hands. "I am not a scientist," he says blandly.

Archer hmms, and resets the display. "Let me see if there's anything that doesn't match our own surveys..."

While Archer works on it, Jiro draws Oi's attention to the milled block of text on the pedestal itself: "Founder's Day". "Nothing I'm aware of in New Queensland history. A password or key-phrase, maybe?"

Archer works on the comparison for a while, then sighs. "Nope, that's not it. It's on automatic; it assumes the artificial bodies are still in their original orbits. But it's not pinpointing anything by misplacing it on the display."

Oi squats down and traces the inscription with a finger, his game-player mind hard at work. "Dates are really short, and provide only a few dozen bits of randomness. Laughable as a password... and the phrase 'Founder's Day' is even shorter. I think it's a hint about something else."

Oi stands up again. "The Founder of what, you suppose?"

On a hunch, Jiro takes charge of the terminal, telling it to display the layout of the star system on July 24, 2198 - the founding of human interstellar civilization.

The planetary map reconfigures in the blink of an eye, showing the configuration of the natural celestial bodies on July 24th, 2198. The artificial bodies, such as the Stargates, are missing. Nothing else seems to happen, although Oi's terminal chirps for a moment. "Whoa," he says, waving his fingers in the air, cueing the machine to sift through data. "That was weird."

Jiro turns, expectantly. "What happened?" he asks crisply.

Oi taps on his wristpad for a moment. "Network activity. When you put in that date, there was a brief squirt of network traffic between the terminal and... umm... something else. Not sure what."

Jiro hums. "Start monitoring carefully," he directs. After a few moments, he keys the display to the founding of New Queensland itself. And a few moments thereafter, he sets it to the earlier date again.

Escobar folds his arms and leans against a column, lost in thought. "Not the Day of Founding... the Day of the Founder..."

Archer says, "His first appearance? Could be."

Oi taps at the terminal some more. "Something is definitely listening when you're inputting those dates, Jiro. Something very, very quiet..."

Finally, Jiro keys in the date of the Shining One's revelation, in the era of Jormungand.

Oi taps frantically at the terminal. "It heard it. And it sent an ack packet - an acknowledgement. Something's happening..."

As Oi speaks, there's a rumbling under the floor, and the five-meter replica-dome of Delta Cancri splits and retracts into the floor, revealing a dark ramp leading lower into the mountain. A fresh wave of argon gas exhales forth from the apeture, indicating that this new area was sealed off even from the rest of the embassy. Light panels flicker to life within the hidden corridor.

Archer says, "I think it likes us..."

Jiro waves an armored hand at the newly-revealed opening. "The Embassy invites us to partake of its secrets," he murmurs. "This is the furthest we've ever progressed in our mission."

Jiro turns away from the terminal a moment. He aims his suit's lasercom at the shuttle's receiver and quickly begins dictating a summary of events. He summarizes earlier conversations with the Tasmanians about the dangers of approaching the Embassy, and outlines the means Oi employed to enter. The resulting report will be available in the shuttle's computer and prominently marked, should the second Aurora team come here. But there's one other thing..

Jiro heads back toward the shuttle. "We can spare a few minutes," he explains. "Escobar, please leave some sort of message outside - somewhere that your people might find if they come here looking for us. If Aurora-2 makes contact with them as we did, they will be able to tell them at least how to get inside the Embassy; my computer record will do the rest. I'm going outside to set up a laser relay to beam a copy to Aurora as well."

Escobar nods, and draws a small notebook from a pouch. He writes a message and hands it to Jiro. "It's waterproof and marked as mine. Simply leave it where it will be found."

Archer says, "If you just crack the door a little, we shouldn't have to run the jammers."

Jiro nods to Archer, and accepts the notebook from the Coulam guardian. He departs for the doors, making sure that if this is his last mission, at least his successors will fare better.
