# Synthetic Saints 2004-11-18

Team Aurora is in a previously-hidden sublevel of the Republican Embassy on New Queensland. The central chamber is occupied by a confused clerk program. Corridors extend in six directions from the central chamber, like spokes on a wheel. Each chamber is lined with dozens of nanostasis tubes - 1800 in all - that appear to hold a significant portion of the Embassy's original staff in stasis. The team has revived Doctor Vazquez, the chief of surgery, who is recovering in the infirmary. Everyone is gathered in the core room at the moment, including Escobar, the Coulamite watcher. Oi is still patched into the pedestal projecting the confused clerk program, who flickers in and out of focus as Oi works.

Per Vazquez' advice, the team has located the stasis tube containing Eldrige Park, a man that Vazquez suspects of being a 'Saint'. Vazquez has not yet been lucid enough to explain what that means; however, the tube is easily located and inserted into the surgery machine.

It becomes apparent almost immediately that there is more to Park than first appears. Outwardly, he is a middle-aged man with asian features, dark hair, and an unlined, relaxed face. However, the medical scanner shows him to be heavily augmented by nanotechnology and other subtle modifications - some even in advance of New Queensland's level of technology.

In fact, the nanites in Park's system come to life almost immediately, quickly repairing the damage inherent in nanostasis much faster than for Vazquez. However, even with Leandra's careful supervision, the program halts early, after just an hour. The crystal window on the stasis tube remains dark, but several words scroll across the panel - 'UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS. INPUT OVERRIDE CODE TO CONTINUE.'

Jiro makes his way to the recovering doctor, jerking a thumb over his shoulder in the direction of the resuscitation operation. "His systems say he doesn't want to wake up," he reports, succinctly. "We need someone with better authorization first."

Vazquez croaks wearily. "That's not supposed to be possible." He swings his legs over the edge of his bed and hobbles over to the surgery machine with the help of a cane. "This is strange. His internal systems are resisting the revival..." A hologram appears over the control console, showing a scan of Park's body. "He was scarcely damaged by the feezing at all... oh, my... I don't remember him having all these implants before."

Vazquez sits down heavily in a chair and drinks from a glass of water. "The Saints were never identified. I only suspect that Park is one of them because he brought a refugee in, a man named Angelo. Park's records don't show any of this being in him before... but I never examined him myself. Which means that either this is new, or he had it all along."

"The latter is likelier," Jiro concludes. "What are the Saints? Operatives of the Shining One?"

"They were rumored to be," Vazquez says. "I've been in Republican service for... well, counting waking time, more than fifteen years. I don't know if I ever truly met one. It became sort of a joke, really. We'd blame both inexplicable fortune and misfortune on the workings of the Saints."

Leandra considers the case carefully, then says, "This is not the first time I've seen such implants. Still.." She trails to silence, looking very thoughtful as she begins to remove one of her gloves. "I may be able to do something."

The crystal window on Park's tube blanks for a moment, and then reappears, saying, 'PLEASE INPUT OVERRIDE CODE OR PASSPHRASE TO CONTINUE.'

Oi wanders over from his work, the scent of a riddle drawing him. After a moment of looking at the console, he lets out a long hum. "This isn't a good security system," he says with a smile. "To maintain tight security against a determined attack, you have to be willing to wipe out the data you're guarding rather than let it go to the attacker. Would they do that if the data was a human being?"

"We don't know what they might do, Oi," says Leandra. "I can do.. something, but I will need help, and proper facilities. I assume we have enough access now to adjust atmosphere controls? I need an operating room to be brought to about 0 degrees celsius."

Archer says, "Any chance that you could spoof the override code, Oi?"

Oi grins. "I never met a system that I couldn't crack eventually. But... umm... what happens if I get it wrong?"

"That is a risk I am not yet prepared to take," says Leandra. "This is my patient. I wish to try my way before you try to break him." She frowns in distaste, "Oi, can you prepare the room?"

Oi frowns. "Sure. If that's all you want." He moves to the console on an adjacent surgical suite and begins tapping at buttons. "I'm going to assume you want the atmosphere to be breathable. At one degree above freezing he's not going to oxidize in any hurry anyway." The lights flicker on inside, and the room is prepped.

When the room is prepared, Leandra enters, facing the chill without a complaint. She opens the tube and reaches out, placing both her hands on the chest of her patient. If others wished to join her, they would be ordered to stay well away and keep their words to a whisper. It always starts with a focus, a feeling as if she were reaching out, into the body of her patient. She lets out a deep sigh, and her heart races, her breathing increasing with it as her nanites make contact with the Saint.

Her attention is lost in this, but later she will explain what she feels now. As she reaches she encounters not just a slumbering body, but a swarm of nanobots almost complex enough to be a living being in themselves. She would say almost, until she hears them speaking to her in a clear, neutral voice, void of any sign of accent, reaching out to her even as her own abilities project into the sleeper.

The nanites speak to Leandra. _This is an irregular procedure. We are being awakened out of sequence. We can only assume that some anomoly has arisen in the world outside. Why are you doing this?_

Leandra needs to think a moment, and her answers come as spoken words. "We were advised to awaken you next. We seek guidance." She lets out a deep breath. "Many terrible things have happened during your slumber."

_Advised by whom? You are not Republican personnel. What is so special about Park?_

"We were told that Park may be one of those called Saints," answers Leandra. "Whatever authority the Republicans had does not exist here anymore. You have been sleeping now for over one hundred years. The world you knew is gone."

_We understand. These are exceptional circumstances and we are inclined to allow you to proceed with the revival. However, we would find it easier to comply with your request if you were able to provide a recognition passphrase._

"I am Leandra of the Coulam," she says, "And I do not know any of your passphrases. I am not sure what else you would wish of me."

The mysterious voice fades. However, it seems that Park is breathing naturally, and his heart is beating. He's comatose but should recover shortly.

Shortly thereafter, Park is awake. His eyes flutter open, revealing flinty grey irises. He sits up suddenly, not showing any after-effects at all, and looks around the room, his expression hard. "Which one of you is Leandra of Coulam?" His voice shows none of the hoarseness that Vazquez had after his revival.

Archer points. "Her."

Leandra is surprised, of course. But she recovers quickly, offering a bow. "I am Leandra of the Coulam. I awoke you. We have a great deal to speak of. But first, how do you feel?"

"I'm feeling well," Park replies. His accent is similar to Vazquez', and you gather it is a 'generic Republic' dialect. He looks over each of the others. "Although I am quite confused. You are not the relief team. We have slept for a very long time. There is virtually no sign of civilization on the surface." He frowns. "I would appreciate an explanation."

Archer says, "The explanation will depend in part on what you can tell us. But... we gather that the rampancy event here led you to go into stasis and wait for the repair and relief crews to arrive. Unfortunately, if that's yer SOP, it backfired. We believe the rampancy event covered the entire Republic, near enough to simultaneous as makes no difference. We're an exploratory crew from Ayer, and this is the first intact Embassy we've found."

"As far as we know, we are the first humans to use the jump gates since the time you went into your long slumber," says Leandra quietly.

"And what of the Australites," he asks. "There were nearly half a billion people living on New Queensland. Why have they not recovered from the rampancy event?"

From his position, loitering about and watching science at work, Jiro steps forward. "The population has been confined to Fraser's Island and Tasmania, that we are aware of," he reports, tersely. "The entity active on this planet, which has been dubbed 'Schwarzgeist', uses periodic satellite observation coupled with an electromagnetic pulse to suppress technological development. Further, bombardment from space especially around the Embassy may be responsible for discouraging further repopulation efforts."

Park looks each of you over carefully. "And why awaken me?"

Archer says, "The Rampancy event has apparently not yet run its course."

"Dr. Vazquez tentatively identified you as a 'Saint'," Jiro continues. "The sophistication of your implants supports the assertion that you are an operative of some kind. Hence you are the most suitable person we could find for an emergency situation." He gestures to Leandra, Oi, and Archer, then himself. "We are offworlders and strangers. We are on a short time-table, but within the next several hours, take whatever steps you need to verify our claims. We will cooperate fully."

Park asks, "OK... then where is Vazquez?"

Jiro nods in the direction of the doctor. "We'll take you to him."

Vazquez limps around a corner, looking more healthy than before. "That would be me... Mister Park."

The two men look each other over for a moment. "Alright, Doctor... then how did _you_ know?"

Vazquez shrugs. "You brought in Angelo, in a stolen cryotube. Which was labelled 'Frozen Sea-Trout'. And you asked me to make sure he was frozen properly, and then he disappeared. That was extremely odd behavior, when your personnel file says that you are a maintainence technician." He waves at the imaging scans of Park, still showing on one of the monitors on a surgery machine. "You're the most heavily augmented janitor in history, Mister Park."

Park blinks. "Did I? I don't... remember... much of that."

Park looks confused for a moment. "Oh. Right. Yes, I did."

Park's flinty expression returns. "Where is Angelo now?"

Archer says, "Still in stasis."

Park looks over at Vazquez. "Heat him up."

"Who is Angelo and why should we awaken him?" asks Leandra. "I'm afraid the situation is a dangerous one, and due to recent findings, I am very reluctant to awaken anyone in haste."

"Angelo designed an EMP vulnerability into the law-enforcement CPU's that would have countered the ability of the government to control the local computers. That was why he was charged with 'treason'. We were trying to exfiltrate him, but the locals found him first. So... when we got him here, he was already dead." He shakes his head. "There have been rampancy outbreaks on other worlds before. This one... seems to have gone beyond our estimations. Angelo's solution may be heavy-handed but it could kill the infestation in one blow."

Park accepts Jiro's offer to inspect the team's logs. He sits at a desk in the infirmary, reading everything on a remote terminal. He stops several times to ask for clarification, particularly with respect to the hostile entities encountered on the Stargates. Finally he just leans back and shakes his head. "You've been... busy." He seems to say it as much to himself as to the Aurora crew.

"Our sister-ship is due within days," murmurs Jiro. "We want them to be safe. We want to know what happened to the One. And we want to know more about the Aeons. They may have something I want.. And finally, we need to make this system safe, as a branch point for further cleanup. Whatever you and the others here can do will be of inestimable help to us, Mr. Park."

Meanwhile, Angelo has been inserted into the surgical machine. The scans indicate that it might take 24 hours or more to revive him. In addition to the damage inherent in nanostasis, he seems to have been shot by some kind of energy weapon, and caught it in the abdomen. The burn extends well below the surface and has damaged several of his internal organs... probably instantly fatal, when it was inflicted.

Leandra returns after the revival of Angelo is successfully started. To put it lightly, the Coulam looks stunned. After a time of blank surprise, she announces casually, "In the other room, using the machines they have here, I am bringing life to a man that is as good as dead. I must learn how these machines work and how to make more of them. We must not fail in this."

Park shrugs at Leandra's pronouncement. "Immortality isn't all that everyone thinks it is, my Lady."

"Perhaps to you the revival of a life means little," says Leandra. "But to my people, it is a thing of great beauty. Does life mean so little to you, then?"

Archer chuckles. "Maybe he's just bored."

Park explains further. "I think maybe I should warn you. Until I woke up, I had forgotten that I was what you're calling a 'Saint'. I still don't really understand what that means, save that we are some variety of secret service. The machines inside me only allow me to remember what I need to." He shakes his head. "It seems I have been in the service of the Shining One for a very long time. But for the life of me I can't remember why." He shrugs again. "Life means much to me... but it seems that my own does not mean quite so much as another's."

Park looks around the room again, meeting everyone's eyes once, before looking away. "I've decided that I'm going to trust you, for now."

"'Ours is not to reason why, ours is but to do and die'," quotes Jiro. "It is a very old and trite expression, and a very true one. I look forward to working together with you."

"Your life means as much to me as any life does," says Leandra softly. "And I will do what I can to help you. But I must keep my rounds going. I think I am going to start waking others.." And with that, she gets back to work.

Vazquez and Park survey the Embassy, coming up with a plan to restore their frozen comrades faster. Surgery machines in other parts of the embassy can be used to un-thaw several people at once. Reviving all 1800 sleepers could take several months, so they give priority to personnel who can restore power and speed the revival process.

Meanwhile, the surgery machine carefully repairs the damage to Angelo's body. It's not a subtle solution. Nanites duplicate cells and grow synthetic substititute tissues to heal his wounds. Ironically, Angelo is completely non-augmented, which means there are no internal systems to either aid or impede the process.

---

The initial euphoria of the team's discoveries has faded in its due course, and the human body, no matter what technology it has, must sooner or later be granted its due. For his part, Jiro has taken up station in the shuttlecraft at the entrance to the Embassy. He's made doubly sure that no power is reaching the front door now, and there are alarms on it wired to the shuttle's computer system just in case. Now, he relaxes in one of the two reclining passenger seats the shuttlecraft offers for long space-voyages, waiting for sleep to come and go.

Leandra sleeps near the operating room. Though other doctors here may have more experience in the use of this equipment, she considers them all her responsibility and leaves strict orders for the others to wake her if anything should go wrong or seem strange.

Archer crashes in the other seat - the pilot's couch is deliberately _not_ conducive to sleeping, after all.

Vazquez and Park claim that they've slept plenty for this century, and continue their work into the night. Escobar takes a part in the sleeping rotation, keeping watch in the hallway outside the infirmary where Leandra supervises Angelo's ressurection.

It's several hours after dawn when Leandra announces that she's ready to awaken Angelo. Vazquez advises that it would be best to awaken him slowly. "The shock of being brought back to life one hundred years after a violent death," he reports, "is sometimes an even worse trauma than the original wound."

Leandra shuts off the IV keeping Angelo in an artificial coma. A few minutes later, his reaction bears out Vazquez' prediction. The first thing he does is sit straight up, screaming repeatedly, his voice raw and rasping, hands gripping his abdomen.

Leandra lets him react, first. Best to let out that initial shock, so Angelo can conclude that his stomach doesn't hurt now, and that he's far from dead. After a few seconds, she will speak softly, "You are alive and well. My name is Leandra, who might you be?"

Angelo looks around the room wildly. He jumps off the recovery bed on the opposite side from Leandra, and promptly collapses, eliciting another yelp of pain.

Leandra frowns and mutters at the lack of restraints. She knew they might be needed. It seems her soft hand may have caused her patient more pain. She moves quickly to help the man, provided he doesn't seem dangerous. "You are hurt. Please, let me help you. I am of the Coulam. I will not harm you, but if you continue hurting yourself, I may have to restrain you until you are able to walk on your own."

Angelo moans. "I give up. Do what you're going to do to me."

"You were just brought back to life," remarks Jiro, who is standing near in case of violence. "You are needed for something, which we'll explain shortly. Now then.." He steps forward to aid Leandra in lifting.

Angelo slumps back into the bed, looking defeated and sullen.

"Relax," murmurs Jiro with a smile. "You're going to be a hero. Now get some rest.."

Angelo shrugs. "What the hell kind of trick is this?"

Jiro shakes his head. "No trick. We'll explain when you're ready."

Leandra offers Jiro a small smile, pleased to get some help in moving Angelo back to his bed. Once he's comfortably situated, she will make an inspection of his wounds. "You are going to be a difficult patient, aren't you?" she murmurs. "Fortunately, I have undergone some very intense training as of late to keep people like you from slipping into impossible moods. I think for now you need rest. But feel free to ask any questions you wish. Just be aware that some things must wait. You are still weak."

Angelo asks, "OK, it's not a trick. What are you going to do with me?"

Archer is leaning on the door. "We're going to feed you up and get you healthy again, and then we're probably going to use your back-door to save the system."

Angelo looks Archer over, and is silent for over a minute. "You're kidding, right? Who did you say you were?"

Archer grins, and deliberately exaggerates his Ayeran accent. "Technically, we didn't, cobber. I'd tell ya how long ya were asleep, but ya'd probably go walkabout."

Angelo slumps back into the bed, staring at the cieling. "Oh, God. Just when you think it can't get worse..."

The situation is explained to Angelo slowly. Park and Vazquez drop in when they hear that he's awake. Park explains, among other things, that he rescued Angelo after he was shot by the New Queensland authorities, and brought him the Embassy.

Slowly, Angelo becomes more talkative, especially when Jiro explains the problem with Schwarzgeist. He looks over at Archer. "So... you're not revolutionaries? And it's... 2815? Is that right?" He pauses. "That's crazy. That's so crazy, it can't be a Government trick. If you were going to try and persuade me that your my friends you wouldn't pick something so insane."

"Unless..." He suddenly looks wary again. "That's what you WANT me to think."

Park rolls his eyes. "Oh, for the One's sake. Why did I bother." He stalks out of the room.

Jiro stays. This nut will not be tough to crack, given a little more time. "You must think a lot of yourself, if you think all of us would go to such effort to con you," he says, evenly. "Are you really that good?"

Angelo sits up and glares at Jiro. "Oh, yeah, pal," he says. "I am that good. I built the backdoors. And I broke them all, so that they'd never have the total control that they wanted."

Archer says, "When you're up to walking around, we'll show you our ride. It's parked upstairs in the Embassy lobby."

Jiro nods and smiles. "So naturally you're the man to come to. You're a smart guy. Very smart. So you tell me: is there any plausible reason for us to go to all this trouble, to try and get you to voluntarily help us, other than that we are telling you the straight truth?"

Angelo thinks about this for a few moments. "No," he finally announces. "So... what is it that you want me to do, again?"

Jiro nods, calmly. "We want you to work with our Oi Vey, who is a hot-shot systems guy. We intend to isolate, maybe destroy, a hostile entity using New Perth as its base of operations. The stakes are New Queensland and the entire system of Delta Cancri, plus probably all of our lives." He waves a hand off and up, vaguely. "Whatever planetary government is left sails around in canoes and grows trees for their living, and I doubt they care much about prosecuting you. I personally don't care what you did, so much as what you can do. What I hope you will do."

The cleric lays a light hand on Angelo's shoulder. "You're a hundred years older, my friend," he says. "The statute of limitations is up. Now it's time to use your brain for something larger than yourself. This is the most important riddle you'll ever face, and maybe the biggest hack in this planet's history. You can be in on it."

Archer says, "And if it works, you _will_ be a hero. The entity smashes anything electrical by dropping space debris on it. People have been living in the Victorian Era since a little while after you went to sleep."

Angelo looks at Arhcer and Jiro, and shrugs. "All I did was get caught. Fine. You want me to fry your rampant monster, we can fry it. We'll need... several thousand meters of Socolite... a couple of tons of conventional explosive... a small nuclear reactor... oh. And a huge turkey club. Start with the club. I haven't eaten in a long time."

Jiro smiles and backs off. "On it," he says, and moves away.
