# Synthetic Saints 2004-12-02

Life is slowly returning to the Republican Embassy on New Queensland. Vazquez uses several surgery machines in other parts of the building to thaw out his staff, in preparation for thawing out the remainder of the 1800 personell frozen in the crypt. Meanwhile, Angelo works with the Aurora team to plan an infiltration of Mount Storm, a location he identifies as the most likely haven for Schwarzgeist's 'master node'.

Park, for his part, is quiet and reserved, and often seems disoriented. He claims that parts of his memory are slowly returning, but that most of the secrets of the Saints are still hidden from him, carefully locked away by the colony of nanites living in his blood. He does provide detailed maps and plans of Mount Storm, New Perth, and the surrounding area. The maps themselves appear to have been stolen from New Queensland's Ministry of Security in the months before the Crash.

Angelo brings the maps up on a holographic display in one of the Embassy's briefing rooms, marking off important features with a light-pen. "Mount Storm was built as a planetary military command center," he begins. "I once worked there as a civillian contractor, so I can tell you a few things about it. It's got redundant power sources - hydroelectric turbines driven by an underground river, for starters. The water is used as fuel for a fusion reactor, and also as a moderator for geothermal taps. It's safe to say that there will be backup power cells on a lot of the equipment. Wrap all of that up under a hundred meters of solid granite, with fused-silicate walls half a meter thick... and it was damn near impeneterable."

Archer says, "And we don't want to arrange the necessary firepower to penetrate it even if we had it available. It'd be rather a bit too messy."

"Fortunately we can worry about such things after we've silenced the mountain," says Jiro smoothly. "After that, if even 50% of this goes well, we'll have plenty of time."

Archer thinks about things for a few minutes. "The river is the weak point. Water for fusion -and- for coolant for the geothermal taps. But first we ought to isolate it from communications with the rest of the nodes. Has anyone ever tried that?"

In response, Jiro brings up the display of his approach, developed in cooperation with Angelo and the mission knowledge-base. "There are three known antenna farms on the mountain itself," he explains, pointing at a diagram, then to the radius of effect for the renegade's EMP bomb. "Non-military systems on the city and beyond will be disabled in an instant. We just need to collect warheads from whatever live defenses are still around, and we'll have our explosives to use against the antennas."

Angelo nods. "Our communication satellites are hardened, and at worst you'll kill one transciever on each. They also aren't subject to the universal enforcement system, so you'll need to destroy these antenna farms to truly isolate the mountain."

Angelo waves his hand and highlights several other buildings in Orange. "As to whether anyone ever tried, Mister Archer..." The buildings dissolve to reveal dozens of armored vehicles. "The area was defended by a battalion of military police. Vigilant personnel were an integral part of the security plan, so it's doubtful anyone could have destroyed even one antenna system. Obviously, with the human guards gone, you need only deal with the drones. You will probably have a much better chance."

Archer chuckles. "I meant _since_ the crash. I was aiming that at our Coulam friend."

Escobar shakes his head, poking absently at the hologram of the forested area near the access road leading to Mount Storm. "I'm afraid this is beyond our capabilities. We haven't had much need of explosives for military purposes, and never mounted an expedition to Mount Storm. Explorers that went there didn't come back, often as not."

Archer nods. "About what I expected. We'll just have to see what we can find out."

"On that note, we'll need to notify the leadership of the human survivors," points out Jiro. "A notebook near the door isn't enough. They'll need to be prepared to evacuate the inhabited areas if necessary."

Escobar straightens. "Evacuate? You're going to bottle the genie up in its mountain. What are you expecting it to do, to threaten any settlements?"

Archer says, "We don't know. Hopefully nothing. But we don't wish to take chances."

Jiro explains. "Military systems often contain autonomous programming - instructions on what to do if contact with headquarters is lost. If Schwarzgeist so arranged, we may see results as extreme as orbital bombardment of selected population centers, as a form of revenge. Its fractured psyche is difficult to predict."

Angelo nods. "Well, the original programming for the drones and automated defense systems depended heavily on the level of alert they were in when communications were lost. In peacetime they'd simply shut down and activate anti-tampering mechanisms. In time of war... they were programmed to shoot at anything that moved."

The cleric's eyes tighten a bit, as he looks directly at Escobar. "I realize it might seem selfish to you, that we put your people in possible danger. To you, what we are doing is attacking an enemy who has done nothing more offensive than disable your attempts at using radio. I don't know how to impress upon the Coulam, or the other natives, that Schwarzgeist permits you all to live at its convenience, and nothing more. I don't know what safety you'd enjoy had we not come, or how long you'd have had it. All I pray is that we are doing what's best for yourselves as well as for us."

"I am not trying to debate you, Jiro," Escobar begins. "But I do wonder what balance of power we will be upsetting. You are right. Schwarzgeist has allowed us to live at its convenience for a very long time, and we find such servitude - even by default - unacceptable. But I still wonder why. What motivations it had. Whether those motivations will continue to protect us if this plan should fail."

Archer says, "More than radio. It eliminates any use of electricity, as well. This basically freezes the planet at 19th century tech. If it was protecting them from some outside threat, it would enlist their aid, not make them helpless."

Jiro shakes his head. "If this fails, who knows how much faster the inevitable doom may come - if it comes at all. If it succeeds, we are at least in a position to try and find the answers to the questions you ask."

Leandra finally speaks up, since her position may do much to assure Escobar that this is the correct course of action. "The Coulam of Ayer have trusted me to judge situations such as this," she explains. "And there can be little question that the Entity does not promote the growth of human life, and that it is our duty to strive against it due to this fact. It's acts of suppression here are quite clear. You can either deny the path or fight. Death may come with fighting, but death too has its place in the cycle."

Escobar thinks for a few moments, and nods. "It is true. All is temporal. And so one must sometimes crack the egg to be born." A pause. "What defense can we arrange? You mentioned that your backup team should be arriving soon... tomorrow, wasn't it? Can they assist us in the even of a bombardment?"

Archer says, "Not right away. They're scheduled to arrive in-system, but they won't make orbit for another week or so."

"I don't think we can count on Aurora-2's help for the early stages of this plan," admits Jiro. "However, in the later stages they will be invaluable."

"What about the resources that are already present in the system?" asks Leandra. "There's a whole fleet out there that could theoretically be taken control of. That would help, would it not?"

Archer says, "It would - but I was going to ask, how dangerous could they be if we _can't_ grab control of them. How capable would you estimate them to be on autonomous programming, Oi?"

Oi has been muttering to Angelo about details of the map. He glances up at the mention of his name. "Hmm? Well, that depends on whether or not I have to fight SG to get at them. As far as I can tell, each infested system is a less-sophisticated duplicate of the whole. So... the amount of Schwarzgeist present in a Revenue cutter should be no challenge... if we can isolate it."

Escobar asks, "How shall we warn the people of Holiday, then? How soon are we going to do all of this?"

"As soon as possible," says Jiro, firmly. "We fly cautiously back, warn the authorities, and proceed to New Perth airspace. I see no reason to delay, unless someone has seen something we've all overlooked thus far."

---

The sky is cold and clear when Team Aurora returns to the surface. Park, Vazquez, and the others stay behind in the Embassy, thawing out their fellows and preparing for the aftermath of the mission. Without the cover of bad weather, there's not much for the shuttle to hide under, so Archer just flies as fast as possible back to Tasmania, setting the shuttle down in the same place as before.

Once again, it's just before morning. There's a light fog in the alpine forest. Escobar takes point for the march back to civilization.

Two kilometers outside of Poplar Gulch, most of the team notices something odd. Escobar, especially, becomes more cautious and waves everone to a halt. He creeps back to Jiro and whispers, "Too quiet. No birds."

Jiro's first response is to drop one hand to his belt, whereon his sword and pistol hang. "We defer to your wisdom in this land," the cleric murmurs.

Archer says, "Drones, y'think?"

"Perhaps it would be best to plan for the worst," suggests Leandra. "I have a feeling that extreme caution at this point is the wisest course."

Escobar whispers, "Don't know what it is. I don't smell anything yet. Follow me. Keep back twenty meters. Stay low." He scurries silently to the front of the line. Sometimes he crawls, sometimes he creeps.

Escobar holds up his hand, bringing the team up short. He looks around carefully, then sweeps at the ground with his fingers, uncovering a tripwire.

Archer says, "I've got a bad feeling about this." He glances around the area. "We're surrounded."

At that moment, a man steps out from behind a tree, further up the trail. He calls out, "Yes. You are. Don't do anything stupid." He has a heavy Australite accent, and is dressed in a wool suit that looks unusually formal for the back country.

Escobar rises to his feet slowly. "Gruber." He speaks the word with venom.

Archer frowns. "We do _not_ have time for stupid games right now."

Jiro holds up a hand in Archer's direction. His other hand still rests near his sword, but does not move, and his eyes flicker from face to face, waiting to see how Escobar and Gruber will respond to each other.

Gruber raises a hand. "Now that voice," he says. "That voice is not a voice from Holiday. Am I right? And your mates here," he waves a hand indicating the three members of the Aurora team, "Are out of town guests. How rude of you not to introduce them."

Gruber continues, "Now, I'm a man of standing. And I know when to be polite. So let me introduce... my friends." He waves again. Six men step out from behind other trees, three on each side of the path, over thirty meters away. They're carrying double-barrelled shotguns that appear to be post-Crash manufacture. "Now," Gruber says, "Those guns won't do much at that range. But the claymores off the side of the trail will. So how about we have a bit of a chat then, eh sport?"

Escobar looks back at Jiro, less for guidance and more to make sure that his three charges are not taking any rash action. He looks back at Gruber. "What the hell do you want," he growls.

Archer actually looks interested. "Claymores? Maybe we can come to an agreement. That sort of thing would be quite useful where we're going."

Gruber grins. "Thought it might. Which is why... we are here. Now... you're going to give me some answers. But I'm a civilized man, so I'll give you a choice as to how ugly this gets.

Gruber's men begin walking forward, towards the trail. Gruber holds up a hand when they are about ten meters away. "Let's give them a moment to think about it first, eh, boys?" He looks over at Escobar. "What's it going to be then, sport?"

Archer shrugs. "Don't see the harm in that, as long as it doesn't take too long. We're working under a time limit here, and it affects - quite literally - everyone on the planet."

"Things are ugly with scatterguns and explosives around you," remarks Jiro, casually. "Civilized discourse requires civilized surroundings." And he flashes a look to Escobar, his eyes showing a look of curiosity - _who are these people?_

Escobar takes the look and replies, "A scavenger. Recovers old technology from ruins. Even if he has to make the ruin himself."

Archer chuckles. "Well, we were planning to try making a mess of Mt. Storm. Sounds like he'd be helpful to have along, eh?"

Gruber and the others walk slowly closer. "Oh, you don't give me enough credit, Escobar, old chum. That's just business. We all have larger goals in life. Time to think about those."

Five of Gruber's men herd you down the trail to Poplar Gulch. One remains behind and recovers the 'claymores' - which turn out to be stun grenades. There's a large diesel truck waiting in town, with a covered bed large enough to hold the four of you and four of Gruber's guards. The others load into the cab, along with Gruber himself.

Everyone seems to stay inside at Poplar Gulch, and the truck is soon bumping down the road to Appleton, the next town down the line. It pulls up in front of a large cinderblock building. Gruber's goons usher you inside, where a crude conference table and office chairs are arranged in the center. The goons take up positions at the corners of the room, with one waiting outside the front door. One disappears through a back door. Gruber himself sits at the head of the table and motions for the rest of you to sit.

Gruber lights up a cigar and puffs on it, then speaks. "Now... I'm going to keep this real simple. You lot - " he indicates with a wave of his hand - " are important dignitaries. Only you're not just here from some canton or other, are you? So when people start talking about lights in the sky a week ago, old Gruber thinks to himself... now ere's something we've been waiting for, for a long long time."

Archer twitches an eyebrow, just a little. _We?_

Gruber continues, "Now, if you have come back to old New Queensland, after no spacer has landed here in over one hundred years, then you must have come here with some kind of plan. And that means, you have a way to take out The Bug. Which has been, it is safe to say, the most important consideration in local politics for a very long time."

"Which means," he finishes, "That if you succeed, there's going to be a bit of a power vacuum, isn't there?" He grins. "And it's important to consider who is going to fill it."

Jiro glances at Escobar, showing a brief moment of confidence, before turning his attention to Gruber. "Let's talk frankly, Mr. Gruber," he says. "You think that we are going to save the planet, and you would like to be a boss, with a clear line to being THE boss. Am I right?"

Archer says, "There will be _opportunities_, Mr. Gruber. I fail to see why it would create a power vacuum. The current polities will simply be free of an unpleasant constraint."

"Ah, but that's just it, gentlemen. I'm so pleased you understand!" He leans forward and waves his cigar, which trails a line of smoke in the air. "Ever hear of Hobbes' Leviathan? Well, that's what we've got here. The big monster that keeps people honest. Remove that monster... and there will be so many oppotunities. A hundred years ago, we had laws to protect us from those 'opportunities'." He takes a drag on his cigar. "I think you'll agree with me, that some opportunities... it's better to give 'em a miss, right?"

"I don't want to be the boss," he says. "I just represent a group of people... that think the 'boss' should be a little more... orderly." He grins again.

Archer suppresses a wince at such a cavalier misquoting of 'Leviathan', and wonders if he's actually read it. "This is all very well, but why interrupt us?"

Escobar says, "Simple. He wants to know how we're going to do it. Then he'll take out the bug, and have all the control." He stares darkly at Gruber. "It won't work. It doesn't work the way you think. This isn't just a worm that got into the enforcement protocol. This is something else. You're a fool to interfere."

Gruber scowls back. "And if it takes a fool to interfere, what does that make the lot of you?" he says. He stubs out his cigar. "I'm going to give you some time to think about it. I didn't expect you to just pony up, so now I have to go and figure out what the hard way is going to be."

Archer says, "Ah... I do hope you're not going to tell us -- Mr. Gruber, that's pathetic. He's quite correct. There is no pre-planned sequence, and you don't begin to have the skills to pull this off."

Archer says, "Do you think that living here under the control of the Bug, you'd have developed the necessary skills to take it down? Why d'you think it hasn't allowed you electricity?"

Gruber growls, bordering on a shout. "That doesn't matter to me, mate! We want the answer! And if we can't get it, then it's just as well for us that nobody else has it either!"

Leandra narrows her eyes and speaks, but not to Gruber. To the men who fight for his money. "In less than 12 hours the rest of our fleet shall arrive. If they detect any activity from the master node they will begin preparation for quarantine. In less than 10 hours after their arrival they will isolate the master node's position on this planet and gather five asteroids in preparations for a mass-driver assault."

"Naturally they will try to aim more or less directly, since it saves us a great deal of energy on terraforming, and we hate losing a planet," Leandra explains. "But when a 300 kilometer asteroid strikes a planet at ten times the speed of sound, well.. let us say that there have been no reports of a survivor in such a case. I would hazard a guess that only two of the asteroids will be required for full confirmation, but standard policy indicates the third must be fired to ensure eradication. I fear you have us quite wrong. We are not diplomats."

Three of the four gunmen start to look uneasy, and look at each other; the implication is obvious. The four just looks blank. After a moment he says, "What... the hell did she just say?"

Pointing up with a finger, Jiro looks halfway skyward. "They'll be right.. up .. there," he says, his voice instinct with veiled menace.

Leaping across the table, Jiro places one foot against the kidnapper's chest. His sword is in his hand with startling speed, and before the gunmen can look down from the imaginary skyward threat, the scientifically-sharpened edge is at the back of the man's neck.

Archer moves much more slowly than Jiro, but his sense of the future lets him react before the cleric/soldier starts to move. He gets his pistol out as he rolls out of his chair.

Escobar is out of his seat and punches the slow-witted guard in the stomach, taking his weapon from him. He swivels around and points it at the goon down the wall from him. The remaining three gunmen have been preoccupied with the 'threat from space', and notice a split-second too late what is going on. Gruber stares at Jiro with hatred in his eyes. "Shit."

"Tell 'em to drop their guns," barks Jiro, his eyes boring into those of the other man. "Hands up, everyone. Real slow."

Gruber grunts. "Dammit. Do it." The other goons put their scatterguns on the floor.

Archer grins. "She was exaggerating, a little. The 300 kilometer planetkiller is the fifth in the sequence, the first three are much smaller. And there are often survivors on the opposite side of the planet from the target."

"Well done," says Leandra. "Now that this little.. distraction is through, I think we had best mop things up." She turns her eyes to Gruber, and the normal empathy in them is gone, leaving only a frosty look from her and she wrinkles her nose as if she were staring at a particularly unpleasant insect. "I imagine we must dispose of that one, but the others I believe may be spared, if they agree to be silent and stay out of our way. Their lives depend on our success, in any case."

Jiro half-turns his head, trying to track Escobar in his vision without losing sight of Gruber. "Grab their guns," he says, then returns his attention to the would-be king.

One of the brighter gunmen says, "Time to be goin', lads." The others look around uncertainly for a moment, then follow him out.

Gruber growls, "I'll find you!" The last departing goon says, "Not bloody likely." He touches his fingers to the brim of his hat, facing Leandra. "Good day... er... madame." The door squeeks closed behind him.

Escobar and Archer quickly secure the abandoned weapons. Gruber stares daggers at Leandra. "You're not going to kill me or you already would have. You're soft. You can't let soft people run the world or we just end up where we are now. Someone must be the bastard. The Bug is the perfect bastard, except it isn't one of us. You know what you're doing if you give the world back to people?"

Leandra turns her attention back to Gruber. "Could someone please do something with that?" she asks, gesturing to the man. "I find his conciousness.. taxing."

Jiro holds up a free hand, then slides carefully off the table and rests the blade sideways along Gruber's torso. With a deft gesture he slides the monomolecular blade along the man's skin, cutting open a fair slice. The blade draws away, stained with blood, as Jiro grabs Gruber's shoulder. "You'll die in a few minutes, with that wound," he counsels, evenly. "The woman you just insulted can let you live. Give her a reason to."

Archer says, "I'd better make sure they don't borrow the truck. We do need to finish our trip quickly." He leaves the room to do just that.

Gruber, to his credit, grunts, and doesn't pass out. "Like I said. This world needs its bastards. How can you have the humane, without the inhumane?"

"Your philosophy has no meaning to us," answers Leandra. "This concept of humanity you have is obsolete. You do not seem to comprehend our purpose, and for that you may well die. But that choice is your own."

"Then you need me," he says quietly. "Because I understand that obsolete philosophy, and many on this rock follow it. If you mean to take this world, it will go easier if you can convince the people to come willingly."

"This planet has many valuable resources," says Leandra. "Hydrogen, carbon, nickel, oxygen, and nitrogen." Her lips curve into a smile, but her eyes do not mirror that emotion, "Life is made of these things, but life can be created swiftly after it is removed. The entity you call the bug is not just a rampant beast. It is a lesson left by the Shining One. We have learned the lesson. The individual is of little importance. The whole is all. To mirror this, those of us who are chosen are given many lives. We are copies, so our losses are not important to the whole." She moves slowly closer and reaches out, her nanites rushing into the man to both heal him and render him blissfully unaware of the world.

Gruber slumps in his chair, unconscious, his wool jacket soaked with blood from Jiro's cut.

Jiro wipes the blade clean and resheathes it, then turns away. Silently he leaves the room.

Archer nods as he finds the truck where it had been parked. And a crate of sixteen grenades, and a second with about 20 kilograms of dynamite. _Ah, good. More explosives would be handy._

The Aurora team also commandeers Gruber's truck, to speed up delivering their message to the Coulam embassy. Greyrobe promises that they will prepare for an evacuation, if necessary, although he is concerned about where they might evacuate to. The team returns to the Walkabout in late afternoon and prepares for the trip to Mount Storm.
