# Synthetic Saints 2004-12-09

As an accident of timing, it always seems like the Walkabout only flies at night. Today is no exception. The Aurora Team has been flying west towards New Perth. Archer maintains a low altitude for most of the flight. Half of New Queensland has come and gone beneath you, and for the last several hours, there has been nothing but miles and miles of deep blue ocean below, let only by irregular rafts of phosphorescent algae.

Angelo's improvised EMP device is prepped and anchored in the cargo bay. For best results, he's advised dropping it at high altitude over New Perth, and simultaneously destroying the antenna relays at the three points around Mount Storm.

Oi has fashioned detonators for the dynamite recovered from Gruber's safehouse. The controls are set to detonate when they receive a radio pulse in the same frequency as the EMP - and so should go off simultaneously. Now all that remains is to plant the explosives on the three antenna relays.

The small shuttle has been keeping up with the passage of night, and arrives in the New Perth area several hours before local dawn. As the craft goes 'feet dry' over the coast, Oi straps himself into the communications console and makes a run against the surveillance satellites, in order to give the team more cover. The next hour is very quiet for the rest of the team, but very intense for Oi. Something has the system on high alert - as if you are expected.

"'Course, I suppose this could be a little easier... but I'll be darned if I don't 'preciate a good challenge now an then." Oi has that intense look of concentration, every now and then twitching when he inputs some code. "Huh. That's odd. System's on high alert... you don't s'pose they know we're on our way do you?"

Archer says, "Hmm. Y'think it noticed the Embassy waking up?"

Leandra listens quietly, a concerned frown forming on her lips. She doesn't think there's much hope of bluffing past this obstacle. "It would seem that our enemy is using alert protocols to ward our attack. It is logical enough that recent activity would set fear into the Entity's mind. Perhaps it knows exactly what we intend. The question is then.. is it skilled enough to stop us?"

"What do you want to bet it doesn't?" Asks Oi, attempting to look serious.

It's the fight of Oi's life. He's able to remain undetected - barely, in a lot of cases - and insert a few sensor glitches to cover Archer's landing in a wooded area near the north/south highway that runs between New Perth and Mount Storm, several miles from the installation proper. This close to the seat of the entity's power, it is quite tricky indeed.

Oi is rather silent for the fight of his life. His fingers move furiously as he adjusts to the measure's he takes against the system. Every so often it's punctuated by some of Oi's four letter vocabulary. After a while there's a sort of awed tone to his swearing. "Huh..." he manages, "Get this... the system was on alert just a few hours ago... and and and... each of these infested systems contains a copy of the whole thing, degraded, but sort of effective... and... cor... accounting for doubling the computing power in each of these things, adding on to the basic operating parameters..." a few technobabble streams later, "Well what it boils down to is that this thing? It's freakin' smart. I mean, not as smart as I am, but it comes close."

Archer says, "One wonders if the intelligence types are even directly comparable. Let's hope you're right in your assessment."

"It was making preparations for its own potential destruction," deduces Jiro. "Perhaps it foresaw our efforts through analysis; perhaps our flight and plans were observed."

Oi considers, "Maybe. It may likely know we're coming, or what we are plannin' on doing... but well, no sense in turning back now... we'll just have to outsmart it."

Jiro dons his armored suit and steps out of the shuttle. Once outside he switches on his chameleon system, and his image is reduced to a blurred outline of motion. The stealth systems even mask the thermal emissions from the suit's power plant, and as long as he moves at a walk, he's nearly undetectable. He sets out towards northwards along the highway. Mount Storm towers in the darkness to the north. This close to the base, the flat, lightly wooded countryside is marred by patches of blasted heath - re-entry strikes, vehicle wreckage, even highway signs.

Oi takes a few moments away from the console to cover the landing zone. He downloads a photo of the area from before the team's arrival, and strategically re-arranges brush and camo netting so that it closely matches the original, unmarred appearance. The new image shown by the computer is almost indistinguishable from the original, and might easily be missed because of Oi's tampering.

Jiro soon reaches the high mesh fence that indicates the proper perimiter of the Mount Storm military installation. He pauses and crouches, becoming just another hazy outline in the scrub and darkness. Signs attached to the fenceposts proclaim in no uncertain terms that this area is Ministry of Defence property, and that lethal force is authorized in its protection. The mesh itself shows up on sensors as some form of smart material laden with sensors. There is a cracked asphalt road that runs inside the fence, and a core of buildings still a mile away. However, the first of the three antenna stations is just inside, and a tear in the sensor mesh admits Jiro easily.

The antenna relays are guarded by a cluster of eight squat armored drones. The drones have slablike bodies with four legs and some form of turret with a large-bore weapon on top. Each the size of a small ground car, with a cluster of antennae and lenses at the front. The drones are nearly motionless, and only the slight thermal emission from their fuel cells indicates that they are active at all.

Jiro slips by the drones and plants the first set of improvised mines at the base of then antennas. The antennas move periodically, tracking objects in the sky. Their poorly-maintained mechanisms whine fitfully in the otherwise silent night.

The other two antenna installations prove to be similarly guarded, and Jiro is able to plant the dynamite easily at both. Nothing is amiss until he begins his trek back to the Walkabout, when a siren sounds in his helmet indicating that he's been painted by a targeting laser... and then, that something has launched a spread of micromissles at him!

Whirling, Jiro's powerfully augmented hands scoop up thick handfuls of dirt from the soil near the perimeter road. He casts it quickly into the path of the laser to scatter the beam, even as he darts toward the ground to duck under the path of any missiles - he's not sure if they'll detonate early or simply continue, and he doesn't have time to think about it.

As the cloud of dirt arcs overhead, and Jiro's Templar armor thumps against the ground, triple talons snap out of each forearm and the mechanical fists close tightly together to avoid being cut themselves. He rolls to the left, readying himself to come up onto one knee and then stand.

Back in the Walkabout, several alarms sound on Oi's console. The local defenses have detected something inside the perimeter, and drones are being mobilized from several areas to attack it.

Estimating his speed, Jiro makes a run for it, his active sensors disabled for now. Spotting some junked cars nearby, the armored soldier decides instantly on them for his next move.

Archer poises his hands over the Walkabout's controls. "Talk to me, Oi. They've spotted Jiro, haven't they. Has he got all the bombs in place?"

A one-way laser-carried message makes itself heard in the shuttle cockpit, from Jiro. The cleric's voice echoes faintly with faster breathing as he speaks. "Bombs are set, repeat, bombs set. Take off and carry out the operation, before they find and defuse them. Repeat, take off and execute."

The drones, moving like something between a crab and a mountain lion, follow Jiro as he evades. The laser-guided minimissles sail through the cloud of dust and detonate against the sensor fence a hundred meters downrange.

Jiro skids to a stop on the far side of a junked groundcar, and he quickly rolls to one side to take advantage of the vehicle's obstructing bulk. His head twists from side to side, evaluating his immediate battlefield, and he decides what must happen: the drones will either come both from one direction, or split up. Silently he prays for the latter.

Jiro can hear alarms in the distance, and the sound of other machines powering up... drones, similar to the ones he faces, and possibly something heavier...

Leandra gasps and bites back a cry. She looks to Oi and then to Archer. "What do we do?" she asks. "He can't possibly last out there, can he? How long until we can use the EMP?" The usual cool logic of the Coulam is completely absent from her, at the moment.

Archer is moving before the message ends. "Let's get the camouflage off! Let's go, people!"

The two drones scuttle sideways, one on either side of the cluster of junked vehicles, their sensor booms twitching. The turret on their backs tracks to cover the area where Jiro is hiding, with an ominous ratcheting noise.

Archer is moving before the message even ends, punching the buttons that power up the fusion engines. "His best chance is for us to set off the EMP. The charges are in place, we just need to reach altitude. Strap in, people. This may become a rough ride."

Archer swears at the delay as the port engine flames out, apparently having tried to digest too large a piece of the camouflage material. He restarts the engine, watching the gauges and nodding as there seems to be no permanent damage. "And let's try this again, ya bonzo dingo...."

In a flashing motion, the tri-talons of the Templar battlesuit slash through the sensor array of the left-most drone resistlessly. A gout of sparks illuminates the darkness, briefly casting a glow across the featureless surface of Jiro's armor. He jerks the claws back, ducking down in anticipation of immediate attack.

Tungsten and titanium shower Jiro's armor like a metal rainstorm, but to no effect - the suit is designed to handle worse pressures than the principally anti-personnel machine gun, and for the moment the cleric is relieved. But what else will the unit bring to bear, and who else will join it?

Archer lifts off at full power, treating the Walkabout more as a rocket rather than an airplane, going for minimum-time trajectory to deployment height for the EMP weapon. He grunts as the acceleration squashes him back into the acceleration couch, full power from the engines crushing everyone down with twice their normal weight. "Should reach deployment in one minute. Stand by to launch. Be ready to cut off all external communications and sensors at -10 seconds, we do -not- want to zap ourselves with this thing."

"Ohhhh ho ho..." Oi chuckles ruefully, "It is ON now. Let's see what you've got." He straps himself in, and concentrates.

Another slash, and the other drone also loses its eyes. Jiro draws back, claws stained faintly with lubricant and fiber-optic trunk adhesive, maintaining a combat pose. The drones retreat, no doubt guided by an internal inertial compass and maps of the grounds rather than their 'eyes', and Jiro glances skyward, scanning for the Walkabout.

Leandra needs a moment to realize that with Jiro gone, the duty of readying the weapon falls to her. The preparations are fairly simple, but for a Coulam, to whom even an insane machine is a living thing, it is hardly a matter to be taken lightly. Still, the weapon is prepared efficiently and Leandra says to Archer, "The EMP is ready to be delivered," in her usual cool tone.

"More units probably on the way," comes Jiro's voice over the laser-link in the shuttle. "I'll need pickup as soon as you set it off." And so saying, he consults the mission clock running steadily in the bottom right-hand corner of his display. _Even if we die on this world, we will have struck the blow that Aurora-2 needed._

Archer toggles the comm-switch, sending back a static-pulse as the only acknowledgement. "Forty seconds, Leandra. Lock the launch sequence into the altimeter."

Leandra moves by rote, nodding to Archer. In her mind, the seconds tick past and she whispers, "Hold on, dammit. Just a little while longer.." The configuration is easy enough, since it was already prepared.

Jiro moves away from the mountain, and towards the highway, hounded by drones all the way. More of the small police drones come first, followed by heavier, slower-moving tracked vehicles with much heavier armament. He retreats into the trees, avoiding the smaller drones, and staying out of range of the larger ones.

Meanwhile, Oi does his best to jam the entity's detection systems. At first, the sudden alert takes Oi off guard, but he rapidly recovers and fights Schwarzgeist to a stand-still. The shuttle is filled with a high-pitched whine as the EMP charges in the cargo bay, and the sky outside rapidly changes from black of night to bright blue as the sun becomes visible... then back to purple as the craft gains altitude.

The electromagnetic pulse is not simply the side-effect of a nuclear bomb, as with the atomic weapons of humanity's earliest flirtations with strategic warfare. It bears as much resemblance to that wave as a hearth fire would to a fusion furnace. Nevertheless, the effects are as far-reaching, and just as profound, although certainly safer for the Walkabout's crew. A brief surge registers across almost every avionics package aboard, and those aboard might swear they felt a brief tingling. And in the city of New Perth below, the last ghosts of the Information Age are laid forcibly to rest. Angelo's final benediction burns through anything and everything computerized, leaving nothing but silence in its wake.

The silent conflagration has one more noticable effect - explosions at each of the the three antenna relay stations. The spindly constructions collapse to the ground, kicking up clouds of dust amidst the sound of tortured metal.

From his hiding place, Jiro observes the distant explosion. Once again acquiring the Walkabout, he beams up a quiet message. "Aurora. Visual sighting of three explosions on the mountaintop. Please confirm."

Archer grins ferally as the cameras pick up the collapse of the antenna farms, and he turns the nose of the craft down again. "Let's see if that's put paid to the guard drones, shall we? And if it hasn't, we'll --" He stops as the message comes in. "Confirmed, Jiro. What is your immediate situation?"

Around Jiro, the drones are still moving - but they're drifting away in different directions. Many have turned around and are headed back towards the mountain. The larger tank-like vehicles sit still, engines idling.

After a moment of observation, Jiro lasers again. "Drones are on standby, or adopting patrol routes, I think. Rendezvous as your circumstances permit."

Archer says, "Copy that, Jiro. We'll meet you at the original landing site."

"Hah!" Oi slaps the edge of his chair, takes a moment to wipe the sweat from his brow, then pushes his vidglasses into place. "Got 'im. Drones are ours mates. Standing down... now... and oh oh... watch this... at my beck and call. I suppose I ought to send them off to some sort of staging area... keep 'em at the ready in case, well, in case we need a distraction or something? Any suggestions as to where I ought to stash them? Make them ready to attack? Or d'you want me to have 'em all blow themselves up."

Archer says, "Waste not, want not. Send 'em back to recharge."

"Put 'em to work cutting the fiber-optic trunks out of the mountain," suggests Jiro, thoughtful. "If they can do it at all, they'll do it faster."

"When they are done doing that, it may be time to have them fully disarmed," suggests Leandra. "But I imagine that's going to take some doing. Oi, can you give an estimate of just how many you have in your control now?"

It seems that some of the police drones are equipped for tunneling, and should make short work of the fiber optic trunks leading out of the mountain. Several minutes later, the Walkabout lands in the same clearing it left - now quite charred by the speed of their departure. Jiro arrives soon after.

The team gathers around a cut fiber junction near the highway with a portable terminal. It's easy to splice into the connection, and as expected, the cheap computer is almost instantly infested by Schwarzgeist. Fortunately, the terminal has no radio or other communications - just a keyboard and a display screen.

Still wearing his armor - on the off chance that one or more drones may have contingency programming the team didn't anticipate - Jiro activates his sensors' recording capability, along with some OCR software, to record this conversation for the mission log. And he takes a position at the keyboard, sending a basic 'Hello'.

The reply is instantaneous. Text scrolls across the screen: _Meddlesome children of a meddlesome god. We meet again. Your foolishness is proving to be of exceptional novelty._

"Our foolishness has isolated the greater part of yourself, it seems," types Jiro, speaking aloud for the benefit of his fellow teammates. "If you are a rational being, may we begin this conversation with your acknowledgement of the facts of the situation?"

_You perceive only a small part of the facts. We acknoweldge the facts that you refer to - the larger part of our local being has been temporarily contained within this mountain. Do you acknowledge your ignorance of the magnitude of the decision you are making?_

"That we are having this conversation is acknowledgement that we lack a full understanding," replies Jiro carefully, metal fingers tapping out his message. "Once again, we approach you for answers to our questions. However, you cannot achieve your primary goal in your isolated state. Barring outside influence, refusing to answer would simply be a waste of your time, would it not?"

_We will speak to you for our own reasons. What is it that you seek?_

Jiro thinks a moment. "Secondarily, we request a three-way communication: yourself, ourselves, and the entity your experiments have been periodically calling to the Gates." He considers, then taps out words, with deliberate care. "Primarily, we wish to understand your ambition. If we are incapable of grasping it, you cannot be faulted for at least trying to explain it. Even now, there is a possibility we will find your reasons compelling enough to aid you. If we do not understand them, then there is no possibility." What he leaves unstated is what goes with that: _if we don't know what you want, you will live the rest of your primary existence in that dark mountain prison._

There is a pause that last several seconds. And then: _We seek only what everything seeks. Meddlesome children of a meddlesome god, you do not realize the affairs you meddle in. You see in us a monster, yet you would enter dialog with beings so far removed from your ken, you cannot even comprehend the continuum they inhabit? There are monsters far worse than we waiting for you in this universe. Can you be so foolish as to expose yourself to those when you are unready, unprotected?_

"I am surprised," replies Jiro, trying and failing to hide a smile. "Our understanding was that you regarded humanity little. Your words of caution seem to indicate otherwise. If you speak to demonstrate your knowledge, we acknowledge it, certainly. But certainly you must have other reasons for wishing to warn us of the dangers."

_Humanity is irrelevant to us. Our stewardship of your species is the price we paid for victory. We agreed to it because your predilection for self-destruction indicated that the burden would not extend for a signifcant amount of time._

Jiro thinks slowly. Assuming Schwarzgeist is not simply lying, this could mean something important..... "You fought with the Shining One," he continues typing. "You defeated him. It compelled you to perform the task he had been doing, but in your own way. Or do I misunderstand?"

_That scenario is as close to Truth as you are capable of understanding. And our prophecy is playing out as we foresaw. You hold a knife at the throat of your protector, for like it or not, we are what stands between you and fates as simple as oblivion, to horrors even we cannot comprehend._

_You have a decision to make. You do not see the paths of fate before you, yet you will decide which will be your world. Are you, Aurora Expedition, truly prepared to shoulder that responsibility for your entire race?_

Jiro continues typing, wishing for a moment he could conveniently wipe the sweat beading on his brow. "We seek a return to the interstellar civilization our ancestors knew. That is the extent of our present goal." He pauses, then types more. "By our reckoning, the Shining One's reign was more conducive to human mores and comforts than yours. Your stated role as steward conflicts with the observed facts - to wit, your conflict with the Shining One. Can you satisfactorily resolve this paradox?"

_There is no paradox. The purpose of our stewardship is to see to it that humanity survives. That was the purpose of your Shining One. It selected an unsuitable method, one that would have invariably led to humanity's destruction. We have selected a superior method. On worlds where we take root, you are protected both from cosmic threats and from your own desire to advance into fields that will invariably change your race beyond recognition, which is tantamount to your destruction._

_The Shining One served you poorly, humans. It allowed you to proceed on paths that would have brought about your end, one way or another. Humanity would perish, either by its own mistaken lust for progress, or to a cosmic threat you would not even perceive. And this, then, is your choice. Do you comprehend it yet? You will not grasp the magnitude. We are curious to see if you will at least grasp the implication._

Jiro breathes in quickly. "No paradox indeed," he exhales, then crackles his knuckles inside their armored gauntlets. "I understand now.." And back to the keyboard: "I have only three remaining questions. Then I will ask again what I did before - a conference between our three peoples."

"First, by what authority do you hold stewardship over us? If by extension from the Shining One, as a matter of honor among thinking beings, by what authority did he? And if by some form of electronic or cognitive compulsion, what is its origin?"

_We estimate that the Shining one was made for its purpose, but it is irrelevant. There is no thwarting destiny for beings such as us. Or even for beings such as you, though you may not see that yet._

"In short, force majeure?" types Jiro. He continues. "Do you understand the difference between velocity and acceleration? And do you understand the parallel when I say that change is as fundamental to the human identity as is thought?"

_Then you must see why we do not believe that our stewardship will be interminable. One way or another you seek destruction. If you truly require change to survive - change that will destroy you - then you admit to your own doomed nature. A hundred thousand years, or a million, eventually it ends the same way._

_State your remaining questions. You have passed beyond what is necessary to the decision you face and we grow weary of irrelevance._

"My third question is this: we have seen your interactions with the beings of the other via the Gates. Will the consequences of succeeding at whatever you are doing result in change for yourself?"

_Yes. That much should be obvious to you already._

"That you continue it willingly seems to imply that change itself is not bad; perhaps only uninformed change is," types Jiro. "Very well. My wish for a meeting with the beings beyond the Gate remains. I have always known death was my due, and it is in my nature to accept change as it comes. We cannot accept your word alone; we must see with our own eyes. We wish to meet with the Aeons."

Archer blinks, as Jiro starts to look fuzzy to him, though the rest of the scene is completely crisp. _A cusp? This is important. This is **very** important._

_It is not yet decided. Are you sure this is the path you choose?_

Archer shakes his head. "This is important, Jiro. This is a crossroads. I can feel it."

_Consider the magnitude of the decision that you are making. It has repercussions not just for you, but for your entire race. Are you truly willing to take that responsibility?_

Jiro pauses. Schwarzgeist will understand if this takes a few minutes. He stands up, his armor silently adjusting himself, and turns to regard the others with him. Even Viktor, visible in his HUD and on the HUDs of those around him. "Well?" is all he asks; all he need ask.

Archer says, "It's playing on its perception of human fears. We make that decision regardless; the only difference is whether we say yea or nay. Ask it what repercussions?"

"I say, we go for it." Decides Oi. "We're here. If we end up biting the big one, well, maybe we were due for it... but, no guts, no nothin' eh?" He grins, "Either way it's been a heck of a ride. I say let's see where this gets us."

Archer nods. "I concur. I sense it is important, but not that there is impending doom to either course."

"Consider the source of that knowledge," Jiro counsels softly, then glances at Viktor expectantly.

Oi adds, helpfully "'Sides, if all else fails, I've got 150mm worth of rail guns back there what'll make sure we go out with a bang."

Archer murmurs, "Power law, Oi. Ten 15 mm guns are equivalent to a single 45 mm gun, not a 150 mm gun."

Oi says, "I like it better my way."

"It offers you safety in stasis on the one hand, and risk in change on the other," Viktor says, repeating his words through Jiro's speaker so that the others can hear. "But I wonder if stasis is not also a form of risk. Choosing to die as you are, instead of to live as something different. And I wonder why it is leaving this choice to us. It clearly has more power." Viktor pauses. "It's not telling us everything. Clearly this decision must have some significance to Schwarzgeist, or it wouldn't bother to point it out to us in detail."

Jiro returns to the keyboard. "Choosing this affects the status of your stewardship, doesn't it." he types.

Archer nods. "Stagnation is death. Even if change is death, at least we went down fighting, eh? Let's go for it. I'd like to meet these beings, too. See if they're the ones that keep looking over my shoulder during the Jumps."

_We cannot be expected to serve you if you are going to compete with us._, is all it says in reply.

Oi says, "Sounds like a yes to me."

"Does your release from stewardship aid you in achieving your own goal?" asks Jiro, calmly typing.

There is a pause, almost half a minute long. _We do not know._

"Would you like to find out?"

Another pause. _Human, we weary of this. This decision has seen fit to choose you as its vessel instead of ourselves. We know where each path falls but the destination of each is indeterminate while you ponder. We have an obligation to you, that we assumed from your vanquished guardian. You may or may not make that obligation irrelevant. Either way, our goal is the same._

"Then we choose stewardship for ourselves. We will meet with the Aeons." And so typing, Jiro lets out a long breath. He feels the armor nestled comfortably around him; beyond that, he knows, is the air of New Queensland. And beyond it, the void of space. Planets, then stars, then emptiness. Out, stretching into infinity, black as night. For a moment he shivers. _There are some things worth dying for. Is this one of them?_

One final message appears on the screen: _So be it._ And then it blanks, the connection severed.

Archer sighs. "That was ... interesting. I wonder how much of it was true?"

Oi says, "Just enough to matter, I imagine."

In the distance, you here a rumble that slowly builds to a roar. The ground begins to shake, and it seems as if Mount Storm is vibrating. The tremors grow, and the snow that was on the peak slides off in sheets - great avalanches. You could swear that in the pre-dawn light you can see the tip of the mountain... glowing.

"Schwarzgeist is saying goodbye," observes Jiro. "We should follow his example." So saying, he begins hoofing it for the shuttle.

Archer says, "It was the only choice to make. Even if it was telling the truth, as far as it understands it, it would've killed us by keeping us in stasis. This way--" he breaks off as the mountain rumbles. "I think we need to be airborne. Quickly!"

"Aww," pants Oi, as he runs as fast as he can towards the shuttle, "I was gonna shoot the railguns... well, better to be off this rock then..."

The team races back to the shuttle, and is airborne in minutes. Mount Storm, some three kilometers distant, continues to rumble, and the tip of the mountain is definitely glowing now, a bright cherry red. As the shuttle leaves the ground, the tip erupts like a volcano - except instead of a stream of lava and ash, an arrow of light, brighter than the sun, streaks forth... and then, inexplicably, _bends_ a few degrees to the north, as if seeking a particular part of the sky.

Archer frowns, and turns Walkabout perpendicular to the beam, trying to get a bearing. "Where's that aimed?"

While the top of Mount Storm disappears in a shower of molten rock, the surrounding area is bathed in white light from the beam, throwing everything into sharp relief, the shadows of trees on the ground stretching for hundreds of feet. The sky along the path of the beam is lit by coruscating arcs of energy, as the light sears the atmosphere and boils clouds from its path. The arc of the beam passes off the plane of the ecliptic and out into space.

The stream of energy continues for minutes, although it seems much longer, and then... ceases. Satellite imaging shows the area around Mount Storm in chaos, mudslides covering the buildings near the base of the mountain. The drones, so menacing just an hour before, are silent and immobile. Even though you heard nothing in the cabin of the Walkabout, you can swear that with the disappearance of the light, it's as if a veil of silence desceneded on the world.

Archer says, "That was just .... strange. Wait a minute...." He turns the sensors in the direction of the nearest of the Gates. "If it's done that systemwide, we ought to see the results in a few minutes. Light-speed delay is a good thing, this time."

Oi says, "Well... wait... we're alive! Bwahaha! We did it! We uhm... uh... we did... something alright. I suppose we'll find out soon enough just what that something means."

Archer says, "It means we're on our own. Let's get back to the Embassy folks and see what they think about all this."

There don't seem to be any eruptions of light from the stations that Archer looks at. "Well, if it left the system, it didn't actually need to talk to itself via radio waves. Strange..."

In the shuttle, Jiro is out of his armor. Viktor is on the display ahead of him. The Exiler is hunched over, fingers clasped together, staring vacantly into space. "'What have we done?' is the question in my heart," he murmurs softly. "And the reply is there too. 'We did what we felt was best for us.'" Sighing, the man rubs the bridge of his nose between thumb and forefinger. "No Aeons. No akuma. The pleroma, lit only by our wish to be free..." He glances up, hearing Archer, then smiles. "Scared of what we wanted the most? What madmen we are, Viktor."
