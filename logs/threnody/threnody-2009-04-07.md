Two eyelids open, fluttering briefly. Dead nerves fire erratically. Two eyes take in the light for the first time. Two ears begin to receive sound. Instincts of the body act, without any need for intervention by the nascent consciousness which apprehends their actions.

The first thing he sees is fire. Though he didn't know what fire is, it teaches its nature to him as the light dances on his eyes. This is the outer mystery; the inner mystery then reveals itself, and he knows that the name of the fire is Pyros.

_You will rise, and travel to a distant place,_ it commands, etching meaning onto a mind which heretofore has been a blank slate. _I will show you._

The fire licks out, scarring his hand. It etches a complicated brand onto the palm of his right hand. He stares at it, not comprehending what he sees. In response, the radiantly glowing embers of the tattoo shift on his skin. They turn as his hand turns, so that the diagram always points in the same direction.

_Go! Do not cease in your labors._ The burst of enlightenment is gone, and the fire fades. Blank confusion is all that remains.

Ogrun Swings his legs down and gingerly places his feet upon the unfamiliar earth.

The room around him smells of damp and mildue. Illuminated only through what natural light filters through the small window on the left hand wall.

The rooms floor is covered in 4 inchs of fetid water. Disturbed only now by the introduction of dead mens feet. Over on the far wall a workbench looks hastily abandoned, alchemical experiments continue their laborous work unmonitored. Lying open on the workbench is a leatherbound book, slightly water damaged, and obviously well used.

The unfamiliar language rolls from deep inside the creatures body

Ogrun says, "Hello, is anyone here?"

The rooms only exit lies on the opposite end to the workbench. A solid wooden door, without handles, and obviously reinforced.

Ogrun approaches the door.

Ogrun says, "Is anybody out there?"

Ogrun bangs on the door

Several minuets float by, but to a creature without any sense of time, this goes unnoticed.

Ogrun approaches the work bench, moving slowly.

The diary on the workbench lies open on a page titled 'The Promethean Condition'.

Some of the books more detailed scientific instruction is lost on him. But the basics are still here. You were not born, only created. You do not live, only exist. You do not die, only endure. You cannot stay, you must move on.

Ogrun places the book back down on the workbench and colapses to his knees

tears begin to roll down cheecks unfamiliar with the sensation. And an idea!

Go and find the one who created you, learn what you can and survive.

More time passes and as the mind begins to urge the body forward it moves.

Ogrun Moves around the room grabbing the journal and something to carry it in

Ogrun moves towards the door and firmly plants a foot straight in the middle. He pushes but the door wont budge.

Ogrun says, "How the fuck, am I supposed to get out of here? Hello? Is anyone out there? Let me out of here! "

Ogrun begins to pound on the door

BANG BANG BANG

Ogrun says, "OPEN THE DOOR!"

BANG BANG BANG

As the rage and despair begin to well up inside of him a warm flutter begins to stir inside his chest. The sensation spreads through his body and he pauses in his assault, it feels safe. It feels strong.

The energy wells up and begins to move down his arm. Creating a sense of inertia as his fist is pulled towards the door.

As the fist crashes into the solid wooden frame it buckles, and for the briefest of seconds light, like that from a camp fire, illuminates the door.

CRASH

The light stings his eyes. A street, once occupied, now abandoned to the flood stretches out before him. Pools of fetid water gather in dips and potholes. And the detritus of human occupation floats unmoving in the fetid puddles.

The tattoo scarred onto his palm when he awoke begins to tug at his mind. It's burning point leading him towards some unknown destination.

Ogrun says, "When in Rome eh? "

Ogrun says, "Huh? I wonder what that means?"

Unsteady feet shuffle towards an unknown destination.

The miles shuffle by slowly, and the landscape shifts from urban to industrial. The burning point of the tattoo begins to pull towards one of the nearby warehouses.

Silence and solace, and a rest for weary feet, occupy the next few hours. But the mark persists, and the voice of the fiery blaze still rings in his mind. Onward. North of Lake Catherine, where the highway gives way to bayou and wilderness, something beckons him.

Out in the damp, chilly grasslands stands a lone tree. Blackened branches no longer reach for the sky; they have abandoned the futile search for a sun which can no longer be found in the cloudy heavens. And growing out of the tree's bark, amidst the wood and the fungus, a woman's naked torso and head can be seen. Her arms are the tree's branches, and she smiles as the creature draws closer.

"Hello," she whispers. "Come closer."

Ogrun approaches slowley, unsure of what he's looking at.

Ogrun says, "Hello?"

The woman grins, exposing blackened bark for teeth. "You, stranger," she whispers, as the wind blows softly in the half-darkness. "What is your name?"

Ogrun says, "I think my name is Daniel, Daniel Ogrun. Im not sure about that though, I cant remember. If this journal is all I have to go off, then I guess I'm Daniel Ogrun. "

"Daniel Ogrun. It sounds delicious." The woman licks her lips with a green leaf that serves her for a tongue. "It's cold, Daniel. Build me a fire, won't you."

Ogrun says, "Ok. "

As he begins to go about making a fire his eyes moves across the womans form. "Exactly what are you? Whats your name?

"I have no name, Daniel," the woman whispers. "It's cold. Won't you hurry?"

Ogrun says, "Im sorry."

Ogrun lights a fire

"That's.. better," the woman whispers, as the flames struggle for life in the dismal cold of the marsh. The branches of the tree from which she grows begin to sway slightly, though the wind is only a mild breeze. "Did you know you have a fire inside you, Daniel? Share it with me. It's cold."

Ogrun says, "A fire inside? Im not sure I understand?"

Ogrun looks down to his glowing palm

"You're dead, Daniel," the woman whispers. "The reason you move and breathe and have your being is the fire inside you. Can't you feel it burning?"

Ogrun says, "Yes...I have felt it. Warm and strong."

"Share it with me," the woman pleads. "It's cold."

Ogrun says, "How?"

The woman smiles widely, licking her lips again. "Come closer. I'll show you how."

Ogrun approaches

The tree sprouts thorns. The branches move. They pierce the Promethean's flesh, taking root. Spreading. It takes only an instant. But he can feel the hunger now, the insatiable need to draw out the fire at the heart of himself. The Pyros that burns within him is being stolen. "Thank you, Daniel," whispers the woman in the tree. "I will.... remember you."

Placing his hands behind the creatures head, and his feet against the bulk of the tree trunk, he pulls with all his might, attempting to pull the womans form from out of the tree.

Ogrun shouts "DONT HURT ME!"

Reaching out behind him, he stretches as far as he can reach. Grabbing for a burning stick at the fires edge.

"No, Daniel," the woman whispers, pleading. "Please, give me your fire."

In one jagged movement he takes the stick from the fire, and stabs it into the tree creatures face.

The woman screams, and the skin dissolves from her face. Beneath the melting skin is a skull-shaped knot of wood. The tree catches fire readily, and the acrid smell of scorched flesh assaults the Promethean's nose.

The creature drops the Promethean, and he quickly moves away from her. At a safe distance he stops and observes as the flames jump higher into the dark sky.

Fresh memories implant themselves in the Prometheans mind. Lessons and feelings begin to filter through from the energy inside him. 'The Fire cannot go out, or you will cease to exist.'

"You must keep moving, or they will find you!

Looking to the compass for guidance, he begins to follow the point into an uncertain future. A future more dangerous than he could imagine. A future in this world of darkness.
