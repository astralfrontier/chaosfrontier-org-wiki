# Turning Tides 2007-06-16

At the roof of the world, in a place called Winterspring, the snow lasts year-round. Icy caverns and sprawling canyons of snow defy travelers to do their best, and chilly conditions threaten the lives of those who go unprepared.

Nevertheless, unlike the frozen and forbidden continent of Northrend, Winterspring is alive and vital. The feral denizens of the snowbound land are hemmed in on two sides by demonic corruption and on the other two by a precipitous drop to an icy and unforgiving sea. But unlike the monster-ridden and Scourge-haunted Northrend, Winterspring's inhabitants are wholly natural.

So it is not so unusual to find agents of the Cenarion Circle operating there. Much like Winterspring itself, though, conditions for a druid must necessarily be harsh. Born of a people used to the arcane, shunned by the insular night elves, a high elven druid is right at home in this defiantly alive snowscape.

To a wanderer, the white powder seems unlikely to allow even the most cunning to find sustenance. For Alea'sha, however, this place is a bounty. For the tired dwarf standing at her side, wearing rough skins the druid gave him, the mysteries remain impenetrable. The druid stands just within sight of Everlook, and she will go no closer. "Your friends should be waiting for you there, unless they gave you up for lost," she says quietly. "Your coin should be able to get you passage to Theramore, if you are mindful here, and the food I have given you will last at least the length of that journey. Remember not to wander far from the roads of Winterspring when next you come this way, Alnar Ironhammer."

The druid bows off the gratitude and promises of reward the dwarf offers and laughs softly. "Please, go now. If we meet again, you can bring me news of the outside, and that will be payment enough. Good luck to you." Her smile is calm and warm in this land of ice, but she will not change her mind and go to Everlook. "This is close enough for now," she says three times, and finally the dwarf gives up and under her watchful eye, finishes his journey to civilization. Only when her sharp eyes see him meet his friends at the gate does she turn her eyes to the west, watching the light of day begin its slow descent to darkness.

Jeddek Ironhorn shakes the snow from his mane as he steps up beside his protege to join her in watching the sunset. "Ah, Alea'sha. You are safe and sound, I am glad to see, as is the dwarven traveler." He casts his eyes toward the goblin settlement at the foot of the hill, the smoke of its forge-fires beginning to glow as night falls. "You are still uncomfortable with Everlook, then?"

The tauren stands a full head taller than the young druid, and probably twice as broad across the shoulders. The white snowflakes glisten against the black of his lush mane, seeming to mingle with the white threads that are beginning to grow amongst them. He shakes his head, more slowly this time. "I understand your misgivings, young one. Truly it is hard to imagine a race less in tune with the world around them, less aware of their place in the natural cycle. But for all that they are unaware of it, they ''do'' have a place in this world, and ''you'' cannot have the luxury of ignoring it."

"You are right," replies the high elf. "But I do not like to make my friend nervous, and he dislikes it when I am long out of his sight." The friend, of course, is the almost ghostlike form of a wolf that even now lurks just out of sight, keeping himself downwind, where his friend cannot slip away. "If I did go with the dwarf, his friends would no doubt insist on treating me to their hospitality and I'm not sure I would have been able to get away without seeming quite rude."

Jeddek's muzzle turns up with a smile as he glances at the wolf, its white pelt barely visible against the snow. "Ah, I see," he says. The wolf is so protective of Alea'sha that sometimes he feels as if the wolf regards him as a competitor for her attention. "So it is your friend, not you, that you fear will be uncomfortable with Everlook?" He sighs. "Alas, he shall have to learn. We lack the time to travel such a long distance on foot," he continues, in a worried tone.

"We will arrive where we need to arrive when we need to, or we are not meant to arrive in the time allotted, in which case whenever or wherever we arrive is where and when we were meant to be." The high elf smiles warmly, though there is a hint of concern in her eyes. "Teacher, where must we be in such a short time that our own feet will not serve?"

The massive tauren shakes his head again. "Such is the way of the ''natural'' world, young one, but the unnatural is not so obedient. And in these times, our order must spend much of our time countering the unnatural." His gaze turns to the south, past the foothills of the great Mount Hyjal. "And to this end, the Cenarion Circle is sending us to the Barrens. Or me, rather; the one who conveyed the message was unaware that I have an apprentice." Another sigh, and a roll of the eyes, this time at the circumstances which requires Alea'sha's training to be conducted, if not in secret, then not entirely in the open either.

"Then we had best be moving as swiftly as we can," replies Alea'sha. "We will need to ride the winds, I imagine?" She turns her eyes to the south, letting out a soft sigh. "He will follow us swiftly. I just hope he rests on the way."

Jeddek looks down at Alea'sha with something almost approaching pity. "We will ride the winds indeed, youngling, but..." He sighs, even deeper than before. "The road from here to the Barrens passes through the Felwood. It is far too dangerous for you and your friend together, much less him alone." His gaze falls upon Everlook. "No, for this once we must 'ride the winds' in the goblin fashion." Even as he speaks, the sensitive ears of the three hear the thrum of a motor and look up as a zeppelin coasts toward the goblin town, its white canvas hides painted a brilliant scarlet; though the sun has passed below the horizon for the landbound travelers, its last rays still fall on the goblin contrivance.

\----

Though the goblins might say otherwise, a ride aboard a zeppelin is not a luxurious experience. The air is colder so far above the earth, and the wind cuts through all but the thickest furs. It took more than a little assurance (and gold) to get a wolf aboard, and then still more to avoid putting the animal in a cage. The motion of the ship is far from gentle with the winds whipping as they do in the north. Many passengers get sick from the rocking motions, turning a most curious shade. "On this ride, the goblins aren't the only ones who are green," murmurs the high elf.

Jeddek seems perfectly at ease on the airship - as long as he sits still. A faint prickling on the back of Alea'sha's neck tells her that her mentor is weathering the erratic movements of the vessel by more than just his natural fortitude; instead, he is calling on a small sliver of the power of nature to maintain his composure. "Indeed. More than a few orcs have joined us for this voyage," he says dryly. "Though," he adds, with a quirk of a smile, "I would swear that some of them were, perhaps, of a paler ''shade'' when they boarded the vessel."

\----

The zeppelin managed to take on some cargo during its stop near the Orcish capital city of Orgrimmar, and many of the passengers managed to make their way off the zeppelin - grateful to be home, perhaps, for they made quite a show of having reached their destination.

They are replaced by a new contingent - a trio of people who send shivers of apprehension up Alea'sha's spine and stir a torrent of mixed feelings in her heart. They are blood elves, newly allied with the Horde. They brought several boxes of cargo, including (if it is to be believed) four heavy caskets, which the goblins strapped without remorse or compassion to the bottom of the airship.

The trip to the thriving city of Ratchet, temple to the gods of Gold and Vice, is thankfully much shorter. This in no way makes the destination any easier to stomach, of course. Ratchet is a port city, and pirates and swordsmen swagger through its streets while tradesmen and travelers perform their ages-old intricate dance with each other. Scholars, mystics, savage trolls with pouches full of objects that might be exotic fruit or shrunken heads, and other creatures can be seen in the streets.

Jeddek finds the raucous clamor of Ratchet just as disturbing as does his student, though age, druidic discipline, and his naturally phlegmatic temperament allows him not to show it as much. To help Alea'sha take her mind off the unaccustomed bustle, and possibly his own as well, he engages her in conversation. "Was that the first time you have seen your own kin in the flesh, young one?" he asks, recalling the blood elves that had embarked at Durotar.

Alea'sha watches things without seeming to watch them, her eyes moving, but her head slightly bowed. She rests her left hand on the slightly-raised hackles of the wolf at her side, offering and taking comfort from the familiar touch. "It was, and they were much like I feared they would be, I suppose. Even so, there is hope that what is and has been, need not be in the future."

Jeddek seems to be lost in thought. There had been a message waiting for him when they arrived in Ratchet, and it clearly worried him even more. Finally he speaks again. "Did you happen to hear of their business, then, as we rode? They have been sent as emissaries to the Alliance. Apparently the dwarves have made a discovery in the Barrens, and they are impatient to investigate it. Too impatient, one might say. So... those who worry about such things find themselves as much on edge as your friend does right now," he says, nodding toward the wolf.

"They had little to say that has clear importance to us," replies Alea'sha. "They did not speak of the work of the dwarves." She purses her lips and lets out a soft sigh. "They delve too deeply, and seek mastery of what lies hidden. I only wish they more often pondered why something would be hidden in the first place."

"They seek their roots, Alea'sha," Jeddek says, raising his voice ever so slightly. "They seek knowledge, not power. I cannot fault them for that." His voice returns to normal. "Be that as it may... the dwarves, it seems, have assured us that their intentions are peaceful. Such assurances, naturally, must be verified. And that is the purpose of the expedition from Orgrimmar. They have stopped in Ratchet only because they await the last members of their expedition. One of them, it seems, is to be a druid."

"Are you familiar with the druid we are to meet, teacher?" Alea'sha is naturally concerned that it might be a night elf. "As for the dwarves, I fear they may find power first, and learn only the lesson of the burnt hand."

Wordlessly, Jeddek hands Alea'sha the letter he received on arrival.

The letter is, of course, from a member of the Cenarion Circle - a fellow tauren, it happens. Apparently, someone finally put two and two together and realized that Jeddek did have an apprentice after all - and that his true mission, to the Wailing Caverns, is considered far too dangerous for Alea'sha. Instead, Jeddek has been instructed to send her with the diplomatic mission to Bael Modan - the dwarven name for the ruins found in the southern Barrens. The letter goes on about the particulars of the mission - which explains Jeddek's knowledge of current events in a region far from his usual haunts.

Alea'sha reads the letter slowly, not just grasping the meaning, but the feeling and intent behind the words. "I think they are wise, though I wish I were ready to be at your side in that dangerous place." Having to stand by while her teacher goes into danger is not new to her.

They have reached the outskirts of Ratchet now, and the noise of the city has begun to give way to the rolling grasslands of the Barrens. "The greatest danger in the Caverns is not physical, young one, but a danger of the spirit. The same will be true for you, if on a smaller scale. You will need to learn to work well with your allies, and at the same time, you must promote good will with the dwarves. Provided they deserve it, of course." He looks off to the west. "Our roads diverge here, for now. The letter will instruct you where to go and whom you must ask for." The massive tauren bows to Alea'sha. "Until we meet again." With that, he turns, breaking into a run, then seems to dive forward into the road... catching himself on feline paws, his shape transformed to that of a swift spotted cat, who sprints down the road and is soon lost to sight.

\----

The trio of blood elves, the ''sin'dorei'', are organizing their belongings on the platform when Alea'sha returns to the zeppelin mooring. She realizes that she doesn't actually know enough to navigate Ratchet, and these three might be the best point of contact she has for whatever mission has been decided for her. And so she approaches them on a raised wooden platform, only to see them carefully arranging the funereal caskets they brought with them. Would they have brought their own dead with them? One looks up as she approaches, and speaks rapidly in Thalassian. "Greetings, sister of the sun."

Alea'sha bows slightly, her smile not slipping even as she must correct her estranged kindred, "I am afraid I am not a sister of the sun, but rather a more distant cousin." She looks to the caskets for just a moment, deciding that it might be best to direct the conversation away from this touchy matter. "Is it your custom to travel so far with the fallen?"

One of the elves speaks; the others look away, slightly uncomfortable. "We were looking for a reduced rate. They didn't mind," he explains. "If you are not kin, then what is your business with us?"

"I was hoping you might help me find something. I am not familiar with Ratchet." The druid notices the discomfort of the elves and allows her smile to falter just for a moment. "But perhaps the gulf between us is too vast for such courtesy."

The 'leader' of the group shakes his head. "We are scholars. We mean no discourtesy," he says, a hint of apology on his voice. However, his radiantly green eyes remain steely as ever. "You were traveling with the Cenarion, were you not?"

"Yes," replies Alea'sha. "He is my teacher and my friend." She is still mulling over what the blood elf has said. "Sorry for my distraction," she says quickly, "I think I misunderstood what you said. A reduced rate?"

"The goblins transport cargo at a lower cost than passengers," the elf explains. "Our mission is not the best-funded, as our resources are better invested..elsewhere."

"Well, hopefully I will prove a valuable resource for your purposes," says Alea'sha. She offers the letter with both hands. "My name is Alea'sha. My friend and I are here to help you."

"Friend?" The elf looks puzzled until one of his associates raps him on the shoulder with a hand and points. He spots the wolf, lurking nearby, and nods. "I see." His verdant eyes scan the letter quickly, and he looks up. "You? A druid? ..... I see." And then a peculiar thing happens. He hunkers down next to one of the coffins and knocks on it. The lid of the coffin slides partially away, and a withered, dessicated hand - obviously undead - emerges. The elf places the letter in it, and the hand snatches it back into the darkness of the coffin.

Alea'sha has to again settle a hand on the hackles of her friend, putting him at ease. The elf needs to center herself with care. She has seen undead before, certainly, but she has a strong suspicion this is very different. "So that is what you meant. Still, it must be far from comfortable travelling that way."

"Your first task, then, will be to help us unearth our colleagues," the elf says pleasantly, clearly feeling as though he's regained some measure of situational dominance. "Come!"

\----

The blood elves retained a room in one of the nicer sections of Ratchet. The door has a lock, and the goblin proprietor was even willing to give them the key to it for a minor service fee. Once safely ensconced, the blood elves order wine and one of their number is dispatched to retrieve other things. They cover the windows and begin to remove the lids from each of the coffins.

The bodies inside are draped in funeral shrouds. The lead elf hangs a drape across the room to serve as a temporary partition, separating the living from the dead, and urges Alea'sha onto the proper side. From the other side of the drape, she can hear the shuffling and groaning sounds of the animate dead disinterring themselves and - presumably - putting on clothes or making other preparations.

Three of the Forsaken make an appearance, leaving the fourth of their number behind the drape. They talk amongst themselves in a dirty-sounding tongue which Alea'sha knows from a distance as 'Gutterspeak' - a pidgin of languages used in the meaner avenues of commerce, particularly in Everlook. It was yet another reason she avoided the goblin town.

Each is dressed differently. They wear human clothes and arm themselves as men do, though they carry the pungent aroma of herbs, spices and incense to mask other, perhaps less pleasant odors. But their faces and hands betray their nature, and Alea'sha finds herself turning away when their inhuman glowing eyes regard her.

Alea'sha finds welcome distraction in her friend. He seems less afraid, yet more upset than she appears to be. She finds herself both curious and horrified by what she sees. Still, she was taught to embrace new people, and to keep her heart and mind open.

The fourth member of the Forsaken contingent is the first to speak. From behind the drape, Alea'sha can hear the timbre of his reedy voice, hear a faint hollowness to it. She has heard that the undead can speak even if they lack a tongue, and she's not sure why this memory came to her now. "Wellllll, druid.... there's no need to be.. surprissssed is there, no. Come behind here and help me with something. I'd like to talk to you, yess."

Alea'sha lets out a soft sigh and nods. "Of course." Her motions are more smooth than her mind. Somehow, that still pond is more difficult to achieve when one is facing the walking dead. The wolf comes with her, and she moves past the drape with care. She meets those horrible, burning eyes with her own and bows politely, "You may call me Alea'sha, if you wish. It is an honor to meet you." A troubling honor, but an honor nonetheless.

The eyes are all that she can make out, for the body that's sitting on the lid of its coffin is almost entirely wrapped in bandages. Only the right arm is exposed. It is horribly burnt - charred down to the tendon - and Alea'sha can see every disturbing bit of anatomical detail as the arm moves. The creature is winding itself, but seems to be having trouble. Her letter sits on the coffin next to the thing. "Alea'shaaaa," it repeats. "A pleasure. My name is Ezra. Ezra L. Pyreborn, at your service."

The druid finds this situation both amusing and distressing. The urge to laugh is squashed quickly. "Ezra, do you expect the dwarves are not being completely honest?" She finds that looking at the eyes is better than letting her attention wander. She's seen terrible things, but that mangled hand is still far from easy to ignore.

The undead begins to laugh at that. "My dear.. hur hur .. when it comes to matters of honesty, do you think that people regard the Forsaken as the authority to ask? Now help me bandage, and we'll speak about that. Tell me.. why do you ask it?"

"I find this meeting a curious one," replies Alea'sha. She does as requested. Having something to do takes her mind off of just what she is bandaging. "A high elf druid, blood elf scholars, and your people as well? It is hardly something one would arrange idly. While speculation can lead to wasteful distraction, some measure of it is needed for a healthy spirit. I think the dwarves either have found something, or some believe they may soon."

"Look through a window, child," Ezra advises. "The glass is never perfect. You see what is beyond, but... you see a reflection of yourself, too." He wheezes a bit, rotating the charred arm to aid the bandaging. "The Warchief of the Horde, Thrall, looks at the excavation and sees a reflection of the Horde. Demon-possessed, fractious, imperiled. The Lady of the Tower of Theramore, Jaina Proudmoore, looks and sees a reflection of the war which cost her family. The tauren look and see memories of their grassy plains being overrun by intruders. And so on. Is it that they fear the truth of the dwarves' discovery, or only their reflected fears?"

"Whatever it may be they fear, it is their fear that sends us here," says Alea'sha. "I believe it is our duty to try and relieve that fear." She sighs softly, finishing the bandaging with a nod. "At the very least, we will learn more of ourselves by catching the bits of reflection those windows cast back."

"Some things.. people would rather not see," replies Ezra. He holds up his bandaged hand for inspection. Now that the dead anatomy has been concealed and replaced with a white expanse of linen, he looks fractionally more wholesome. He rises and moves the lid of his coffin aside, pulling clothing, boots, a hat and cane from within. "I am beyond your natural powers, beyond comfort. These bandages do not ease my pain or make my state any better.. They are for ''your'' comfort, ''your'' peace of mind. They hide what you do not wish to see." He dons his broad-brimmed hat; the bandages covering his face spread and stretch, as he 'smiles' behind them. "Perhaps that is sometimes for the best."

"For now, I'm afraid that it is," says Alea'sha. "There are some things I am not any better prepared for than others. We all have things we must conceal." She smiles as she feels that first step taken. "It is our task to make sure that what must not be concealed does not evade us."
