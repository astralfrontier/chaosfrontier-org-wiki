# Turning Tides 2007-06-30

"Well... what's in _there_ is troggs," explains the dwarf guide, when pressed on the locked door. "They kept comin' after us in the night an' we hadda put the door up ta stop 'em."

"Then you won't mind if we inspect it?" asks Kor'ness Sungrazer, the lead ambassador for the Horde, raising an eyebrow. The guide looks uneasy. "Aye, but it's risky," he says. "Ye understand, we don' want anyone sayin' we killed a bunch of ye when it was the troggs did it."

Kor'ness nods. "Understandable. We will select a scouting party, and it is understood that they explore at their own risk. Volunteers?" he asks, turning to his entourage.

Zul'Houngan looks up, and .. well, for a troll it's basically just slouching less. His body rises up as le looks over to the ambassador. "Aye." He says, heeding the will of his spirit master. The old, strange Tauren insisted before he left with the party that this way Zul'Houngan would fine some of the answers he seeks. Or at least, more questions.

The Forsaken beside him, leaning heavily on an ornately-carved walking stick, just smiles through the bandages which cover his face and hands. "Why not."

For the druid that decision has already been made. Alea'sha nods just slightly, but it is enough to commit her. She looks for a moment towards the wolf at her side, then back to the ambassador. "There is no safe journey."

"Good enough," says Kor'ness. "You're to explore the cave beyond this door as far as you can, but take no unnecessary risks. If you're attacked by anything _other_ than these... troggs... or if they give you too much trouble, you're to come back immediately and report. Understand?" He turns to the dwarf. "Will that be satisfactory?"

"Three of ye..." The dwarf rubs his beard. "I dinnae if it's enough, but... well, ye know yer own people best, I s'pose." With that, he pulls out an overloaded keyring and opens the lock. "Ye're ta give two knocks, then three, then five when ye come back. The troggs're tough but pretty daft."

---

Zul'Houngan looks back at his new traveling companions, and nods, approaching the door, he mumbles a few words to himself, as his body becomes surrounded by a light blue shine. Zul grunts, holding the door handle, waiting for the others to indicate readiness.

The stone tunnel beyond is musty and unlit, a sharp contrast to the well-lit delvings of the dwarves' main excavation. After several yards' length, the tunnel opens out into a larger space. Off to the right, a low outcropping of slippery limestone divides the cave almost in two. And over the side of the outcropping, two short stocky figures look up. If they are dwarves, they are seriously ill; clad in loose-fitting rags and armed with clubs crudely fashioned from broken stalactites, their features are grotesque and misshapen. They look up and utter an unintelligible grunt and rush forward, clubs raised.

One or the troggs roars past the outcropping, its eyes seeming to glow red as it goes into a blind rage, and it swings its makeshift club wildly - and ineffectively - at the white-pelted wolf.

Zul'Houngan moves a short distance to close in behind the Trogg, and raises his Mace, trying to smash the cave dweller. Unfortunately, his swing misses wide.

The other trogg similarly begins to froth at the mouth as he charges toward the party...

The white wolf races to the side of its unsightly foe. With a low growl it turns suddenly and lashes out, biting deep into the left thigh of its enemy.

The tatooed druid moves just behind her companion. She brings her staff down on the creature's skull in a slash that just barely glances off. In that brief moment of contact, ice pours across the trogg's skull and down its left shoulder, biting in its own way.

Ezra raises his cane and begins gesturing. The bandages on his hands ripple and flutter and snap about in a sudden rush of air, while a red aura erupts from his fingertips and coruscates across his palm. "Reth kok," he croaks. In answer, the crimson aura forms a lance of fire and strikes at the hapless trogg which had come to assist its comrade. The creature's keyed-up nervousness sends it sprawling away from the blast, but even so it falls heavily and lies quietly.

Beset on both sides, with dark red oily-looking blood pouring from its wounds, one of the troggs finds itself caught between an angry troll and a vicious wolf - and the chill bite on its shoulder from the druid's assault makes it desperate. That still isn't enough - the thick stalactite bounces off the wolf's flank but doesn't faze the creature in the least.

Zul'Houngan swings his heavy, spiked weapon behind his head, and gives another swing across the Trogg. The Trogg swings at the wolf at what would seem to be a fortuitous time, and Zul's swing misses wide again.

The other trogg staggers to its feet, its skin blackened and steaming. As it makes its own wild and fruitless swing at the wolf, the strain of its motion causes its burned skin to crack open, and it howls in blind pain.

Once again the wolf uses the position of its enemy to its advantage, carefully slipping past the defenses of the trogg and ripping once more at the wound it had opened earlier.

Alea'sha steps around the first swarming melee and jabs the butt of her staff forward. Her aim goes wide, and the trogg is able to easily slip past her attack.

Again the mage chants, sending two bolts of azure force to strike the pained troggs. They slump down at last, passing swiftly to death. "Suffer the pain of life no more," Ezra murmurs.

Neither of the troggs is carrying anything resembling coinage, nor any weapon more sophisticated than the stone clubs they carry. However, one of them has a pouch full of colored, translucent stones which look like they could be uncut gems, and the other carries a smooth granite carving, its engraving far too sophisticated to have been made by any trogg.

Ezra hunkers down and scoops up the pouch of stones and the carving, chuckling to himself and murmuring. "We did well, yesss. I wonder, I wonder.." He pockets the goods and rises, supporting himself on his cane.

Buoyed by their success, the Horde adventurers decide to delve deeper into the cavern system. The tunnel twists and turns, until eventually they hear, from down the tunnel, something which sounds a little bit like a muted earthquake... and a lot like snoring.

Creeping into the room, they find a slightly larger cavern, with a large stalagmite protruding in the center. Along the back wall to the northeast, there are three troggs, curled up and obviously sound asleep. Near the pillar, they see another trogg, obviously intended to be on sentry duty, also napping on the job.

Zul'Houngan nods to his other team members, then pulls out his totem, holding it in the air, he mumbles some words to his ancestors. THe loud snoring that was coming from one end of the room has stopped.

With the other troggs blissfully unaware of what has stumbled upon them, the druid creeps forward with eyes narrowed. She measures the stroke with care and drives her staff into the throat of her enemy. In moments its torso and head are covered with frost and it falls to the ground.

"For the Horde," remarks Ezra sardonically.

Zul'Houngan nods to Ezra then Alea. "Da druid should take friend and do the others. We be stayin here, nuke it if it wakes."

One by one the druid and her companion put the trogg's down. It is not a beautiful thing, but death, too, is part of the natural cycle. When the unpleasant task is complete, Alea'sha steps back and lets out a soft sigh. "They have passed into whatever dreams await them."

Ezra says nothing, instead stepping forward to search the bodies for more of the trinkets which interested him so.

Zul'Houngan moves up to loot the corpses as well.

Searching the three corpses reveals more uncut gems, a couple more Titan carvings, and something else. Instead of a makeshift club, the trogg chieftain carries a heavy mace. Dwarven runes are carved on its hilt, and it looks to be of exceptional quality. Where the trogg got it is uncertain, but it's probably spoils from an earlier and ill-fated dwarven expedition.

Though Ezra's examination proves the weapon to have no special enchantment on it, its weight and balance are superb - clearly achieving the pinnacle of mundane craftsmanship.

The door opens to the coded knock, with the dwarf guide behind it. "Ye survived!" he exclaims in surprise. Kor'ness Sungrazer has other things on his mind. "So what was back there?" he asks, his eyes narrowed. "Was it these 'troggs', as our friend here claimed?"

Alea'sha holds the mace carefully, studying it with a concerned frown. At the question she looks up, "They were certainly troggs, but they seem to have access to at least some things far beyond their skills to create." She offers the weapon to the ambassador. "No trogg made this."

The blood elf accepts the weapon. "This is Dwarvish," he says. "Brom...well..." The dwarf starts in surprise. "Bromwell Stoutbeard? Could I see that, then?" Kor'ness peers at the dwarf suspiciously, but hands it over. "Aye, it's Stoutbeard's all right," says the dwarf sadly, and closes his eyes. "We thought him lost ta the troggs, but we never found 'is body. Ta know fer _sure_..." He sighs deeply, his eyes glistening slightly.

"So you _were_ hoarding weapons back there after all..." begins Kor'ness, his temper rising, only to be interrupted by one of his companions. "Sir! Look at him! He's telling the truth!"

"Stoutbeard died for the good of the dwarves," suggests Ezra, withdrawing the Titan carvings from his pockets and presenting them.

This rouses the dwarf from his reverie of grief. "By Muradin's beard! Where did ye get _those?!_" he exclaims.

"We didna find anythin' like that down there when Bromwell... when he..." the dwarf continues, then fixes his gaze on Ezra. "The troggs were carryin' those?"

The Forsaken smiles, his bandaged face contorting in the undead mockery of that expression. "From the troggs. No doubt there are more. Vengeance.. and knowledge.. walk together in those caves."

Kor'ness looks on as this exchange continues, studying the dwarf appraisingly. Finally, he asks the dwarf, "You really did not know that such artifacts were present in those tunnels?" The dwarf can only nod silently, and Kor'ness replies, "Then I fear I owe you an apology. I had thought that your grief was feigned - but your surprise at the discovery of these artifacts is genuine. Your people truly have not explored those caverns after all."

"It would seem they have not, but it also seems that someone should do so," says Alea'sha. "To have such things waste away in the hands of the troggs seems foolish and even dangerous. I think it would be prudent to find out just how many troggs there are and how far that tunnel goes."

The dwarf, beset by sorrow at his companion's loss and the excitement of the expedition's archaeological discoveries, hardly notices that Kor'ness even suspected him, and accepts the apology off-handedly, instead addressing Alea'sha. "Aye, lass. Now that we know more's down there, we'll be openin' this door an' sendin our people down in force-"

"Does this mean you will be bringing arms into the mountain?" asks Kor'ness sharply. The dwarf blinks in confusion, then remembers. "Ah... right. But we _must_ explore that tunnel. We dinna mean ta threaten yer people. What can we offer ye ta prove it?"

"What can you offer? Knowledge. Yess." Ezra almost cackles, rubbing his bandaged hands together. "Share your discoveries with us. And with Jaina Proudmoore. Theramore and Orgrimmar are at peace, yes, because of her, and her hunger for knowledge is as unsated as my own.."

"She will want to know what you've done here. We have much we can offer you, yesss." The Forsaken stares at the dwarven guide. "The dwarves are not the only people to have delved deep into the secrets of the earth."

The dwarf looks uncertain. "This is a personal matter fer us," he begins. "We're lookin' fer our roots in this mountain, an' the humans have nowt to do with it. Neither do ye undead, savin' yer presence, sir. But..." He rubs his beard, and finally nods. "Aye. If that be the price we have ta pay ta go past this door, it's worth it, if ye ask me." The dwarf gestures. "Shall we continue the tour then? Ye still have the livin' quarters ta inspect..."

---

The tour is over, and Kor'ness and his entourage are meeting with Heggin Stonewhisker, chief engineer and the leader of the Bael Modan expedition. "Very well, then," Stonewhisker is saying. "We will share the discoveries from Stoutbeard's Cave with ye an' with Theramore, and we'll accept some of yer people ta join us in the expedition." Kor'ness nods. "Those terms are acceptable to Orgrimmar."

"All right!" says Stonewhisker. "Then there's only one more thing ta cover. Alea'sha, Zul'Houngan, Ezra L. Pyreborn... step forward please."

Zul'Houngan perks up, blinking. He looks at his other two companions, and takes a sort of shamble forward, looking at the dwarf.

"We, the dwarves of Bael Modan, owe ye three a debt of gratitude, fer bringin' back the proof from Stoutbeard's cave that made this agreement possible." He hands each of them a small bag, each containing three hundred gold coins. "C'nsider this a repayment in part for the risks ye took, on top o' the gemstones ye found there. And, there is one other thing..."

And with that, Stonewhisker stands up and picks up Stoutbeard's mace from where it rests on the wall. "Ye three ha' avenged Stoutbeard's death. Will ye carry his weapon into battle, an' remember his name as ye do?"

Zul'Houngan grunts, and looks to the Dwarf. He nods hes head, "Ya. We be doin' tha', boss." He bows his head, and accepts the mace, running his fingers over the runes. Perhaps he can even hear the voice of it's past wielders later on.

Stonewhisker bows graciously. "Thank ye," he says. "Thank ye all for yer help. An' if Kor'ness and ye agree ta it, we'd be honored if ye three would be among the observers." And with that, he shakes the hands of Zul'Houngan, Alea'sha, and Ezra. The prospect of finding the truth of their ancestry is, for the dwarfs, enough to overcome their distrust of the elves, the trolls, and even the Forsaken.
