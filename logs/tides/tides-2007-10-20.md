Jonah Claremont looks much the worse for wear since the party last met him under Bael Modan. He has a black eye, and he's been bruised and beaten. But his eyes reveal that his spirit is as yet unbroken. "You two are the last people I expected to see here," he says. "But thank the Light you've come."

"What is going on here, Jonah?" asks Alea'sha. By instinct she reaches down to rest a hand upon the shoulders of her friend, both taking and lending strength at the same time.

Zul'Houngan looks over at Jonas. He waits a moment for his partners to speak, given as how he's the least articulate of the treo. He waits for Alea then shrugs, "So. How Dem guys get the sickness from da troggs?" He asks, wandering over to JOnah, and looking him over, to see if there's anythign he can 'for him.Help him with.

Jonah shakes his head. "I don't know for sure, but I do know they forced me to drink something foul after they captured me. It smelled like the water from the museum in Bael Modan." His face wrinkles in disgust at the memory. "But so far the Light has protected me from whatever foul humours are in their brew."

"If you start feeling strange, let us know right away. There are things we can do, but yes, it seems the Light has protected you," replies Alea'sha. "Do you know how many of them are here? Are there any others who have resisted the potion?"

Jonah laughs bitterly. "All I know is that after Majordomo Claudius captured me, they locked me up here, keeping me in these manacles. They didn't want to take any chances on me escaping. I'm not exactly up on current events." His face sobers. "I need to find Commander Andreas. He's probably been tainted too, but... I have to try to save him. Somehow."

"We may be able to help you, Jonah," says Alea'sha. "I am not familiar with this place, and I suspect you are far from ready to fight without some helping." The druid doesn't like the meat-through-the-grinder look that Jonah has now, and will do what she can to help.

Zul'Houngan nods to Alea while as he busies himself trying to get Jonah free somehow.

Ezra, in his guise as Ratchet mercenary wizard, raises the keys with a flourish. "These may help," he suggests, fitting key to lock.

Alea'sha waits for Ezra to free Jonah before reaching out to offer him healing. It is just a light touch, but a rush of vitality flows through into him. "Do you feel up to this? I have a feeling we've got some very difficult work ahead. Hopefully our luck is still good."

Jonah smiles broadly as his bruises fade. "Thank you, friends. I owe you more than I can say." He glances at Ezra's key ring, rubbing his wrists. "As fortune would have it, I _am_ familiar with this place. Are those Claudius' keys? If so, the armory is next door. My arms and armor should be there. Lead me to them, and by the Light's grace we will be able to find Andreas and... if he is taken by the curse, I pray I will be able to cure him."

Zul'Houngan stands back. He's still wary of Jonah, given the whole 'having drank the water' thing. He will follow along, but his eye is on Jonah.

The conversation is interrupted by the faint sound of armored feet from the hall outside - presumably one of the regular patrols. From the sound of it, it's coming from the stairwell at the far end of the hall... and in a short while, he'll be close enough to see the bodies strewn along the corridor to the entry hall.

"We either wait for him to find the bodies, or rush out and shut him up now." The druid offers a rare smile, "I say we go put this one down fast." She waits a moment for objections, and hearing none, moves out with her wolf following quickly behind her.

Zul'Houngan follows swiflty behind Alea, pulling his mace off of his belt, and looking down the hallway.

The wizard is the last to step around the corner. He snaps his hand out, a guttural chant on his lips, and a gobbet of flame spits itself from the red aura of his fingers. It catches the oncoming soldier in the face and neck; death is mercifully instantaneous.

Ezra shakes his head. "The dangers of misspent youth.."

Zul'Houngan smiles at Ezra, "At vary least the dangers of corssing you." He grins, and anders over to the Armoury door. He's goign to listen at the door, to see if there are any guards inside, waiting.

The druid sighs softly, and the wolf looks from the smouldering corpse to Ezra for a moment, then settles down to deal with a stubborn itch. Alea'sha thinks a moment and then moves forward, heading towards the stairs with her wolf following to watch for other patrols.

Jonah emerges moments later, sighing regretfully. "If there was something more we could have done for him..." He shakes his head; for all his compassion, the paladin is aware of the rigors of war. He guides Ezra across the hall. "The armory is here," he whispers. "If you would do the honors?"

Ezra hands the keys to Jonah instead. "We will cover you," he suggests. In reality, he's just bored with the idea of opening doors for other people, but there's merit in what he says: Jonah cannot kill a man with fire at a distance. He can.

Jonah also knows the value of caution. He listens at the door for several seconds, to assure himself that the room is empty, before unlocking it. Several minutes and much clanking later, he emerges, strapping his sword belt around his waist. "The war room is up the stairs. This way." He grimaces at the clanking of his own armor. "I wish I could lead the way, but we are the intruders here. We must preserve surprise as long as possible."

"Then I will go first. This is no forest, but my friend and I know how to hunt in many places," says Alea. She creeps up the stairs slowly, her eyes ahead and her ears focused for any hint of danger ahead. Just behind her the wolf moves like a ghost.

Halfway down the hall, the wolf halts, his hackles raising, and begins to growl. Before Alea'sha can ask what is wrong, two murlocs pad around the corner. Their bulging eyes widen, and they reach behind their backs and begin flinging spears at the elven druid and her friend.

The sight of the murlocs catches Alea off-guard for a moment, and then the flash of javelins makes it all too clear that it is time to kill again. The blow to the druid is not deadly, but a hiss of pain still escapes her.

The wolf at the druids side rushes forward with a deep rumble of a growl, slipping past the a thrown javelin with unnatural ease before it hurls itself at its enemy, its teeth finding a mark deep in the arm of the enemy.

The druid is not in a gentle mood. She moves forward with a face as cold as her weapon. Her strike comes swiftly, it is crude, perhaps, but deadly accurate, and where it slams into the head of the murloc it leaves a concussion and coat of gnawing ice.

Uttering a gargled cry of pain and rage, the wounded murloc draws forth a murderous-looking triple-tined spear and swings back, trying to fend off Alea'sha's attacks but unable to find any purchase with its own weapon.

Its ally is luckier. Drawing forth its own trident, it takes advantage of the distraction provided by its piscine colleague, draws back the weapon, and nearly spears Alea'sha to the corridor wall.

The druid takes the blow and the air is knocked out of her instantly as pain explodes through her body. She grabs at the spear that has nearly destroyed her just before the murloc yanks it free. What strength she has left is focused on staying on her feet.

Zul'Houngan runs up as he sees the trogg hit Ales. He gets behind the druid, and pulls out his totem, running the leather straps hanging off of the wand over Alea. He mutters a few unintelligible words, and places his hand on Alea's back. A glow emits from there, as her would close slightly

Some vengeance is necessarily delayed. Violet bolts of arcane power impale the leftmost murloc, leaving it to do little but gurgle in confused mortality. Ezra smiles from the other end of the hall.

Feeling first intense pain, then intense healing perhaps would excuse the druid from her rather remarkable miss. The only thing that can be said positive about the attempt is that she managed to somehow not hit her allies.

Fortunately, the murloc that had already suffered Alea'sha's wrath is faring little better, possibly because it has no allies to heal it. Its spear swings well wide of the druid, striking nothing but air.

But ravaged and broken as it was by Ezra's arcane missiles, its ally still fights on. The tines of its trident manage to rake Alea'sha's side, though the effort is clearly worsening the damage the murloc has already sustained.

Zul'Houngan pulls out his rattle, and points it at the wolf. His knife come out next, and he wraps his hands around it as if preying. After a moment of meditation, he pricks his finger with the blade, and drips a few drops of blood on the ground. A read light emerges as the blood hits the stone, and encompass the wolf.

Rather more insistently now, Ezra lets fly another deadly trio of arcane bolts. The two murlocs fall heavily to the stone floor, and the wizard smiles.

The druid leans against the wall with a sigh, looking back to Zul'Houngan. "Thank you! For a moment there, I thought I was going to lose my way." She is still not exactly steady on her feet, but she's in a lot better shape than the murlocs.

Jonah clanks to a halt, shaking his head. "This is worse than I feared," he whispers, looking a little embarrassed at being unable to help. "I thought it was just a plague that had struck the keep, but if they've invited murlocs here..." He looks around the corner. "It's not far now. Not far to find out whether we can save my old friend from himself..."

Ezra follows wordlessly. A slow smile plays on his lips, for privately, he's satisfied with the outcome. A man's life has been saved, another may yet be, and his power has been very helpful in that work. Very helpful indeed.

There are no other patrols. Jonah waves a hand, calling for a halt, as the group approaches the big double doors to the war room, and everyone applies their ears to the door.

"Hasssss he sickened yet?" asks a female voice. The accent is other than human, but neither is it murloc; there is a serpentine hiss to its overtones. "I told you, my Lady, he will not. The Light protects him." Jonah winces at he hears this voice; it is obviously familiar to him.

"Are you sssssscertain? I could exsssperiment..." "You know your own business best, my Lady. But the paladins of the Silver Hand never fell prey to the strongest plagues the Scourge had to offer." "Very well then. If you're ssssure... then he isss of no further ussse to usss. Kill him." There is a silence of several seconds. "Yes, my lady." There is the sound of footsteps.

Jonah closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, and a tear glistens on his cheek. "Andreas..." he whispers to himself, reaching for the door. But Zul'Houngan shakes his head; clearly the troll shaman would prefer to confront the human commander hand-to-hand. Jonah hesitates, then nods, holding his longsword at the ready as he and his companions prepare for battle.

The door opens, revealing a handsome figure of a human, with close-cropped hair and a neatly-trimmed beard. He reacts in shock. "How...!" he cries out, fumbling for his sword. And sitting - or rather coiled - near the commander's chair at the table behind him is a green, scale-skinned creature with the upper body of a female human and the lower body of a snake or eel; a naga. On either side of her are two murlocs, clearly a sort of honor guard. She reacts immediately, raising her staff. "Foolssss! You've let him escape! Kill him! Kill them all!"
