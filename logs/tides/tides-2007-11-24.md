# Turning Tides 2007-11-24

One of the murlocs utters its familiar, gargling war cry and rushes forward with a speed that seems implausible given its flipper-feet. Before Alea'sha can do more than sway to one side, its wicked trident is scraping across her flank, leaving a bloody gash.

Jonah calls out, "Light protect us!" A violet glow rises up around his feet, washing over him and his nearest allies, and gleams off his longsword as it flicks out to strike at the murloc, grazing its left thigh. Purple ichor wells up from the wound, provoking a gargling howl of pain from the creature.

The great wolf moves forward at Alea'sha's side, its teeth snapping out but failing to leave any mark on the murloc.

The former warlord of Tiragarde Keep utters a blood-curdling war cry and lashes out with his warhammer, swinging it at the druid. Fortunately for the foes of the Old Gods, the Light strengthens their sinews against Andreas' call to battle, and the forces of nature defend Alea'sha from his blows.

Zul'Houngan slips behind the paladin as the doors fling open. He mutters to himself, while moving a pair of rattles over the ground. In the final throws of his spelltrance, he presses his finger against one rattles sharp edge, smearing the blood across as he points at the wolf.

Alea'sha draws out a small bar of iron and calls upon the forces of nature to cleanse Andreas of the curse the Old Gods, her voice whispering a prayer to the forces of life itself.

As the druid focuses her will into the prayer, she can sense the malevolent power of the Old Gods resisting her power and turning it aside. For the briefest moment, though, she senses Andreas' spirit reaching out to her. In that instant, she knows that his soul is still there, trapped inside, and that under the right conditions, the curse may yet be broken.

"He's still alive," Alea'sha says quickly. "His spirit is trapped inside."

The Forsaken thaumaturge dashes for the door as well, eyes alight for the true enemy. He glances right, seeing the scaled skin and coiled tail of a naga. _At last,_ he tells himself, flinging forth his hands and snarling a command in Kalimag to call down the forces of ice. Spiky shards of ice impale the naga, and Ezra marks her surprised death-rattle with some satisfaction. The murloc is hardier, but the pretty blue crystals filling the room are still stained with its blood.

The surviving murloc takes one look at his mistress, feebly struggling with the shards of ice impaling her chest, and howls a cry of utter abyssal rage. Its eyes bulge with hatred as it stares at the apparently human mage that slew its mistress, and it rushes forward, flailing angrily at the paladin who stands between it and its foe.

As its wild swing with the trident punctures Jonah's armor, its companion swings as well, hoping to help distract the paladin and provide the opportunity to avenge its fallen mistress. Its own attack is unable to get through Jonah's guard, but the denizen of the sea does not cease its attempts.

"Halt in the name of the Light!" cries Jonah, his hope rekindled by Alea'sha's words regarding the fate of his friend's spirit. Though his longsword cannot find the murloc's flesh, he holds it at bay, for the moment.

The wolf lashes out in two quick attacks, the magical rage flowing through it causing its second strike to find the flesh of its enemy. The powerful jaws tear through flesh, leaving a gaping wound in the murloc's side.

As the naga goes down, Andreas howls, "Lady Ssatha!" His eyes show brief rejoicing before glazing over with mad rage, and he bulls his way through the packed mob in the hallway, ignoring the blows that rain down on his armor as he pushes between Zul'Houngan and Alea'sha, then winds up with his warhammer and waits for just the right moment, when the murloc has her off balance, then swings hard, dealing a crushing blow to her shoulder.

Zul'Houngan starts to wave his arms above his head. As the warhammer is brought down on the druid's shoulder, a balck mist surrounds Andreas. It converges over his boddy, and comes to rest on his eyes.

Alea'sha growls under her breath at the injured murloc. She has little pity in her eyes as she crushes it with a sharp blow to the head. Ice gnaws through its flesh and in a moment the creature collapses in a boneless heap.

The Forsaken's now-familiar _coup de grace_, the Arcane Missile, strikes the final surviving murloc and reaves away its life. Ezra watches it fall with a sad smile, then wheels to be ready to confront Andreas.

Jonah steps forward. "All right, that's enough, Andreas. You're coming with us," he says. Stepping wide of the once-proud warrior's wild swing of the hammer, he lunges, trying to grab the man, and armor clangs against armor. But the tide-touched human is not so easily subdued, and manages to wriggle free of Jonah's grasp. "N-never!" he gasps.

The great wolf senses that this enemy is not one that needs to be destroyed, and so it moves to help the others pull Andreas down not to kill him, but to save him.

Roaring in rage, looking bruised from where the wolf's paws have pummeled his face, Andreas tries to prise the beast's jaw from his arm. "Get... off me!" he roars, swaying wildly, but is unable to free himself from the animal's grip.

Zul'Houngan Pulls his hands across his chest and yells a gutteral grunt at the grappled armored man. Those who hear it have a passing sense that the world is just out to get them, and they'll never succeeed, but for the target, the feeling ingers.

Alea'sha joins in the effort to pin Andreas down and take him alive. She barely gets a hold of him, but soon her strength is also being directed against him.

With the druid and her companion already holding on to Andreas, the warrior is unable to fend off Jonah's attempt to hold the man down, but he still has some fight in him, and is able to shake off the man's grasp.

The wolf finally just drags Andreas down. Like so many creatures before the man is pulled down by the relentless strength of the wolf. The beast holds him there, growling softly as it pits its strength against the warriors.

Zul'Houngan sees that the Andreas is heald down, and figures this is as good a time as any to try and konk him out. He pulls back his mace, but alas, his strength isn't great enough to get past the armor, and the mastercraft mace is deflected uselessly to the side.

While his companions wrestle with the physical corruption of the keep's masters, Ezra wrestles with the psychic. He has stepped into the expansive master room and drawn out all his mastery of the arcane, feeling the exotic and addictive rush of power flow through him.

Between the druid, her companion, and the paladin, with the mystic assistance of the troll shaman, the mighty commander of Tiragarde is finally brought down. And as Ezra focuses his mind upon Lady Ssatha's dying thoughts, he senses her impotent rage at being overmastered in her own domain, and her fear that all her plans may be laid at naught. As the last threads of consciousness slip away, he senses, _The chalice... what it does can be undone... they... must not..._

Ezra breaks off his casting. He turns, finding Andreas restrained. "There is a chalice," he explains. "Find it. It's the source of the corruption."

The victorious heroes search the room, with Ezra's arcane assistance. Andreas's arms and armor glow discernibly to Ezra's arcane sight, as does the runed staff and blue-scaled leather armor borne by the naga sorceress. The latter, in particular, is disturbingly familiar to Alea'sha: the scales of the armor resemble those of a dragon.

Nothing else of arcane interest can be found in the war room, although the maps on the tables confirm that an attack from the sea was planned on the orc settlement of Razor Hill and beyond. However, Zul'Houngan suggests expanding the search, and Jonah confirms that the room across the hall is the commander's private apartment. There, the heroes find a leaden coffer beside the bed, engraved with Nazja runes in the form of a prayer to the tides. It is locked, but yields to a blow from Andreas' warhammer, revealing a golden chalice engraved with a procession of naga and murlocs engaged in some dark ritual.

"Ah!" Ezra sounds pleased. "Now we are making progress.."

Also to be found are a collection of books, covered in leather, which also resonate with arcane energy. Ezra recognizes them as spellbooks, presumably belonging to the late naga mage.

Zul'Houngan busies himself in trying up Andreas, as he is subdued. He is also libverated of his armor, weapons, and anything else he posesses except basic clothes.

Jonah picks up the chalice, gingerly. His nose wrinkles, as it reeks of the sickly sea odor that they all recognize from Bael Modan. "This... this must have been what they used to make the brew they fed me. It's what they used to pass along the curse. And it's the key to breaking it." He looks hopefully to his friend, slumped on the floor. "Now all we need to do is get him out of here."

Blankets and sheets make for adequate improvised bags. There's much to study and not a little to plunder for the Horde's emissaries to the keep. The imprisoned paladin and his rescuers are able to re-enter the corridor. With the wolf's senses, Alea'sha's delicate awareness of her surroundings and Zul'Houngan's cunning, the remaining patrols present no particular obstacle to departure.

---

Jonah isn't happy with the idea of going to Razor Hill first, but he is soon persuaded by the fact that many lives are at stake. "All I ask," he says, "is that the three of you help me try to restore my friend. And when we have warned Razor Hill of the threat, I wish to return to Theramore. I think this threat touches all our lands."

Ezra spreads his hands and smiles. "Of course. But ... I think these two would object if the Horde wasn't also informed of the danger. So let's not waste time."

On the first day out of Tiragarde, though, Andreas is not looking well. He had struggled when he first regained consciousness, and very nearly had to be dragged. Now, he looks ill; his skin is hot and dry, and his eyes are crusty. "W-water..." he creaks. "Must... have water..."

Jonah offers Andreas his canteen. "I know you're in there, my friend. Rest up... we'll soon have you..." he begins, only to be interrupted when Andreas spits out the mouthful of water, choking and coughing. "No! Must... have seawater..." Andreas groans.

Zul'Houngan grunts over, "Mebe this ain't sucha thing, but You might kill him without what he needs. Before we cure him."

Jonah muses. "It's unnatural for a man to want seawater. Normally, to drink seawater is to die of thirst. It must be tied to his curse." He turns to Alea'sha. "You said he was alive in there. Why is that?"

"Because when I tried to break the curse I could sense him inside, struggling to be free," says Alea'sha. "I knew that it was possible to save him, but I did not know how. I think Ezra has found the way, though we must learn more to figure out exactly how the curse is broken."

Ezra's notion of investigating the chalice is straightforward: interrogate the only living witness to its use, using his mastery of the arcane to override his will. Though Andreas is stubborn, he is weakened somehow, and he is easily persuaded that Ezra is actually an ally.

Asked about the chalice, Andreas shrugs in his bonds. "Oh, that's easy. You pour water of any kind in, and it gets cursed. You make someone drink it, and they come down with the sickness. After a few days, they get this urge to drown themselves in th'ocean, and when they come back..." He grins evilly. "They're one of us."

Ezra nods along to all this, smiling amiably. "And ah, what do you recall about your experience, when _you_ underwent this process?"

"I don't remember too much about before," Andreas says. "I remember being really thirsty... they let me go, and I dived into the water. I took a breath... and when the water filled my lungs..." He grins broadly, a toothy smile that chills every beating heart that sees it. "It was all clear to me. I could see what I'd been missing all my life. I could hear the voice of the God in the rush of the ocean, singing to me of the joy of covering all the land with the Tides. Can't you hear it... whispering..." He slumps. "I... can't hear it so clearly now. So dry. I need water... please..."

"My friend, I'll be glad to give you water." Ezra claps Andreas on the shoulder, still smiling. "But I must know one more thing.. was there somewhere special you had to go? Somewhere specific?"

"Razor Hill was the first," Andreas croaks. "That much... I remember knowing even before that the greenskins didn't belong in Durotar. That's why I went to them. They said they could help. And then... we would bring the Tides," he says, nodding to the chalice, "to the survivors at Razor Hill, swell our numbers. And from there... spread across the continent... one land at a time... with the murlocs at our backs, conquering all..."

"Yes. World power, millions at our feet, unlimited chicken curry.." Ezra sighs wistfully. "Well then. What could stand in our way?" He brings in a bucket of sea-water, stirring it with the ladle thoughtfully. "For example.. someone might think to undo the curse. Did the Lady ever speak of that?"

Andreas' face twists in a rictus of wrath. "She said it must never happen. She said we must fight to the death... if one of us were captured... they might find a way. A way to silence the voice of the God in us..." He slavers as he gazes at the bucket, straining at the ropes, trying to get closer. "I... I can hear the God... there's a bit of Him in every drop of seawater... give it to me... please..."

"The voice of God came to you in the sea.. something that only came when you came into contact with the water.." Ezra muses, still spinning the ladle in its lazy arc through the ocean water. "I wonder...."

From his studies of the arcane, Ezra realizes that some spells and magic may be reinforced by an arcane association. Thus, a curse may be placed on a house, and people who fall victim to that curse may only be cured of it if they are taken away from that home, or if the home is destroyed. For Alea'sha's part, it occurs to her as she listens to this interview that his curse, being bestowed upon him by the Old God of the sea, must be linked to the sea itself. She also realizes that something was blocking her attempt to remove the curse before...

Ezra rises. His foot 'accidentally' kicks the bucket. It spills, and the water begins to drain away, dissipating, disappearing as it runs away in rivulets. "I'm sorry my friend," he says, mock-apologetically. "Let me get you something else.."

Alea'sha looks to Ezra for a moment and smiles. The druid rises and faces Andreas and the iron bar is in her hands again. "This time you lose, cursed monster of the waves!" The nurturing strength of the wild flows through her and pours forth, flexing its might against the curse that imprisons the man's soul, the power snaking through the cracks of the old god's power like tree roots and straining to shatter the whole vile wall.

Andreas tenses, as the seawater drains away. "NO!" he screams, the tendons tensing in his neck and his dried-out gills flaring. "You tricked me! You... you..." he begins, and then his back arches as the druid invokes the Earth Mother's power. A soft green glow envelops him, and he utters an unearthly gargling wail that sounds like a murloc's cry. And as the cry loses strength, the gills on his neck close again... and in a brief burst of shimmering green, they seal themselves as if they were never there. The green glow fades, and Andreas' voice, weakened but calm, speaks once more. "Jonah?" he says... and he sounds different, somehow.

Jonah had been watching the interview with distress, knowing that it was the evil spirit, and not his friend, that was being subjected to the mage's will. Now, he is suddenly animated, hearing that changed note in his old friend's voice. "Andreas? Is that you? Is that really you?" he says, dropping forward and turning Andreas's head toward him.

"I... I dreamed that I was drowning, forever drowning in the sea..." whispers Andreas hoarsely. "I... I dreamed she ordered me to kill you. That can't be..." He stops, his eyes turning to Zul'Houngan. "A... troll?" He struggles with his bonds. "Why is a troll here? Jonah, what's going on?"

Zul'Houngan steps back a bit and looks around. "OI. Someone splain to him? I don't think he gonna listen to me." He looks emploringly to his companions.

"You were enslaved. The naga who did it has been killed." Ezra smiles grimly. "We brought you here and freed you from the curse. Razor Hill was to be attacked from the keep. They've been told." He pauses. "As to a troll... well. Does it really matter who he is? Or does it matter that you're alive because of him?"

Andreas' eyes flash with anger. "Razor Hill was warned? Who betrayed us?"

"Oh.. I'm sorry." Ezra's tone becomes more sardonic. "I just thought.. perhaps.. the orcs would like to know that murlocs from the sea were going to rise up and attack them, having taken over Tiragarde from within. Should we have let them just die?"

"This isn't the orcs' land, you Theramore traitor! They can go back where they-" Andreas begins, still angry. Jonah cuts in. "Andreas, calm down! Would you _listen_ to what the man is saying? The naga would've had you kill _me_. Is _that_ what you would've wanted to take over Durotar?"

Ezra holds up a hand to Jonah, hoping for silence.

"Yes, but it wasn't _your_ plan, was it. It was that of the murlocs and the naga. They took over your mind, inciting violence." Ezra is back to his calm and reasonable self. "They wanted to stir up a conflict between Alliance and Horde, and then attack both."

The mage continues. "I know this, because word reached Razor Hill the moment we arrived at the keep. Thrall will know by now. Theramore will know. And of course, if, oh, it had been your plan, the orcs would be here now. They'd be laying waste to you, to your comrades, and to this little outpost you've managed to hang onto." He stares directly into Andreas's eyes. "_And you wouldn't want that, would you._"

"We're not afraid of any greenskins! Razor Hill can-" Andreas begins, and then cuts off. "By the Light," he gasps. "You're right. The murlocs wouldn't have stopped at Durotar. They'd have taken Northwatch... Theramore... and..." He shakes his head. "Kul Tiras is an island. They won't stand a chance..." He hangs his head and begins to cry. "I've been such a fool... I played right into their hands..."

Ezra stands up. But not before smacking Andreas upside the head. "Now help us fix it!" he shouts. "Get on your feet!"

Jonah cuts Andreas' bonds. "I came to negotiate peace between Tiragarde and the Horde. I thought it was just the old conflict... the war old Daelin Proudmoore started, when the Lost Fleet arrived. But now..." He takes Andreas by the shoulders. "My old friend, once more the humans and orcs have a common enemy, every bit as deadly as the Burning Legion ever was. You were captured by them, and it was the Horde who freed you... freed both of us from their grasp. Will you and your brethren join us? Will you stand against the tides?"

Andreas looks at Zul'Houngan suspiciously for a long moment... then offers his hand to the troll.

Zul'Houngan looks at the hand, and takes it in his own. A strange custom, to be sure. GIven his people greet in other ways. That being said, he grips the other man's palm and shakes. Also bowing his head to him.
