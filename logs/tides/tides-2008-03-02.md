# Turning Tides 2008-03-02

"Just one thing," Andreas is saying, as the party camps behind a boulder just out of sight of the keep. "You need to be present for the illusion to work, right, Ezra? How do we explain your presence?"

"Invisibility," the mage explains. "As long as I don't strike, I can continue casting."

Andreas chuckles humorlessly. "You mages have an answer for everything, don't you? I'm glad you're on _my_ side." He stands up. "Well, magic man, let's be on our way. I just hope we can convince the murlocs to agree to this plan."

---

Andreas is greeted with great enthusiasm by the human patrols that discover his presence, and he is escorted back inside with great relief; Ezra has little trouble making it in behind as doors open and close, and there is enough foot traffic in the echoing halls that his own footsteps are not noticed. The murlocs are rather less enthusiastic.

"You have been gone for three dayssss," says one of the finned monstrosities to Andreas. It is not easy to read the body language, but the bulbous eyes flit up and down Andreas' body suspiciously. "How do we know you have not forgotten the voicesssss of the Ssssea?" he says.

"You have some nerve questioning me!" barks Andreas. "After all I went through to escape those land-dwelling Horde that assassinated the Lady Ssatha and captured me! What did you expect me to do, slay all of them by myself? It was hard enough fighting when I was half-dry as it was!"

To emphasize his point, Andreas bares one of his forearms. Recent scabs, the mark of abuse at orc hands, are visible - a necessary, if painful, part of the deception. "I drank orc blood," he says quietly, staring the murloc directly in the eye. "It wasn't salty enough. I drank from their wells." He draws saliva into his mouth and spits. "It wasn't the same. I had to come back. I thought I was going to die."

The murloc backs away. "Of coursssse, of courssse," it hisses, shuddering in sympathy; its kind naturally depends on water in much the same way that the humans of Tiragarde were unnaturally altered to do. "But... you underssstand, we have no way of tessssting you. Not with the chalisss gone. Those Horde traitorsss must have taken it with them. It'sss a ssshame you could not recover it." The creature shakes its head. "We could drown you, if you like?"

"Another chalice is on its way, I _hope_," says Andreas, glaring at the murloc. "How else could we continue the work? Surely you don't expect to mount a raiding party, find it, and bring it back from wherever they've taken it?"

"We sssent word to Nazjatar ass sssoon as we found Lady Ssatha's corpssse," says the murloc. "They will be sssending a new naga to rule the keep. I do not know if they will send a new chalisss. Lady Val'jara may order a raiding party after all. We cannot let the warm-bloodsss keep it for long. But first she must tessst you, to be sure. And if she does not bring a chalisss, she would have to lock you up until we recovered it." The creature shrugs - an expressive gesture on a murloc. "I hope it doesss not come to that. The humansss admire you. When you went misssing, three of your men were ssso upset that we had to drown them before they could work properly."

Andreas thinks quickly. "Perhaps we should try to retrieve it anyway," he observes. "Who knows what the Horde might learn from it. I'm sure they'll keep it in Razor Hill and have a messenger come to retrieve it. And you'll have less trouble with the men if I'm with them." He leans close. "But know this. This time, there'll be enough water with us that we won't feel... lacking. _I won't let that happen to me again._ Do you hear me?"

The feeling welling up in the man's heart isn't desperation for seawater. It's a rejection of the control he felt. But the feeling is the same - a burning insistence. He hopes that the root of his passion is indistinguishable to the inhuman murloc.

Indeed, such subtlety is entirely lost on the creature. "Of courssse not," the murloc says, almost looking affronted. "We have not been idle. Casks of ssseawater are already stored in great numbers within the Keep, and after your losss I took the liberty of doubling the gathering ratesss, jussst in case. We will have more than enough for every human and murloc in the Keep within four daysss."

"Good." Andreas talks as though the matter were settled. "Now, we should plan an attack to get the chalice back. We should take the men. We should bring it back here as fast as possible."

"Very well," says the fish-man. "We will plan, but Lady Val'jara will review the plan when she arrivesss." Just then, another murloc arrives and murmurs to the first in Nerglish. Andreas' interlocutor's eyes widen, and its bearing seems more cheerful. "Excellent. It will not be long."

Andreas cannot understand the whispered aside, but Ezra has been invisibly monitoring this conversation. And his magic allows him to realize that the murloc messenger has delivered news that Lady Val'jara's party is on its way and will be arriving at Sandfin Village in two days.

Later, when Andreas has a moment to himself away from the prying eyes of the murlocs or his own still-corrupted men, he is able to lay out some maps of the Durotar coastline for Ezra to review. Sandfin Village is, unsurprisingly, a murloc village a day's travel north of Tiragarde along the beach. It is protected from the heavy pounding of the surf by a natural sandbar, but the barren scrubland of Durotar affords little cover between there and Tiragarde. Since Val'jara's party will surely be traveling underwater until they reach Sandfin, it is probably the only opportunity there is to ambush them outside the Keep.

"I'll probably have to stay here," says Andreas quietly, to the unseen Ezra. "My men depend on me, and I'd rather none of them were 'drowned' again. It'll make saving them more painful, I have no doubt. Do you think you and your friends and Jonah can ambush this Val'jara?"

"If Val'jara tells you that she will drown your sorrows," murmurs Ezra, "then we have succeeded."

---

Sandfin Village is, like all murloc villages, a collection of roughly-made straw huts, looking as if they would fall over in a strong breeze, yet able to tolerate the pounding of the surf with little difficulty - though the long poles leading up to floor level contribute to that. The roofs are not for the murlocs themselves, who hardly need protection for the rain, but to prevent their belongings from being scattered.

The village is populated. As the party draws close, they can see the greenish forms of murlocs moving in and around the huts, diving into and out of the water, and generally going about their daily business. A few murlocs can be seen on the nearest huts, looking out along the beach and into the sparse scrubland of Durotar, but so far they have not yet spotted the intruders.

Zul'Houngan grunts aside to Ezra quietly, "Still seems quiet on the front." An idle observation, perhaps, but Zul expected more activity for the arrival of what seem sot be a Queen to these people.

The mage shrugs and shifts about as he studies the village beyond. "We must convince them to let the humans leave the keep. Either we kill the new naga, or we convince her somehow. She is the thing on which this all hinges."

Zul'Houngan turns and look sat Ezra. "From your description, it didn't sounds like the murlocs were going to act until they heard from her." He looks thoughtfully over at the village. "And if we scare her away, we may never get them to move."

Jonah grunts. "I rather doubt we'll convince the naga of anything other than our own destruction," he says. "It seems pretty clear to me. The warmbloods must be turned to their purpose, or die." He rubs his beard. "We'll have our work cut out, trying to deal with her _and_ these murlocs at the same time. Though these don't look as tough. Not like the warrior murlocs back at the Keep."

"We'll fight then," announces Ezra. "Jonah, can you play the part of a taken Tiragardian? I'll masquerade as a murloc. We'll be her escort. The others were hmm, called away. Yes."

Zul'Houngan turns and look sat Ezra. "From your description, it didn't sounds like the murlocs were going to act until they heard from her." He looks thoughtfully over at the village. "And if we scare her away, we may never get them to move."

The party moves through the denser scrubland and circles around the village, avoiding the prying eyes of the murloc scouts. Finally, when all is prepared, Jonah approaches as close as he can, then bursts from the undergrowth and rushes forward, forgoing any battle cries for once. The nearest murlocs turn, utter their gargling cries of challenge, and reach for their spears.

Ezra steps forward, uttering the syllables and twisting his fingers, drawing on the power of the arcane. Three eldritch bolts strike one of the villager murlocs, leaving it grievously wounded.

Ezra's familiar rushes forward as a murloc charges at Jonah, but its fluttering and flapping and cawing fails to distract the creature.

The aquatic fiend shrugs off the bird's fluttering strikes and swings its trident at Jonah, but the strike clangs off the man's armor to no effect.

Two more murlocs rush forward and fling their nets at Jonah. One of them falls short, but the other flies true, unfurling with precision and entangling the paladin in its tendrils.

The murloc recently ravaged by Ezra's attack gargles in pain and flings its spear in revenge. The shaft flies true and skewers the mage, but the creature moans in agony as the effort exacerbates its own wounds.

The rest of the village converges on the disturbance, but as yet they are too far distant to join in the fight, their ungainly legs still unaccustomed to moving on land.

Zul'Houngan runs behind Jonah, lanky Troll legs dashing him up to the front lines. As he's running he pulls you his rattle, and waves it above his head, calling on the spirits to smile favorably on him and his companions. No holy light or anything spectacular happens, but as Zul ends his move, the air seems to shimmer around the group.

The fire elemental that Ezra summoned for this battle rushes forward, engaging yet another of the murlocs. Its fiery fists and body slam directly into the watery creature, eliciting a pained yelp.

Jonah ignores the net for the moment, and the dangling ropes hardly seem to impair his movements at all as he neatly slices the murloc opposite him, leaving it with a gaping wound.

Once again, Ezra's raven flaps and croaks, distracting the murloc.

The murlocs counterattack. One of them rips a chunk of living flame from the fire elemental; another's trident clangs uselessly off Jonah's armor once more; Ezra is less lucky as he is ensnared by a net and impaled by a second spear, though in both those cases it is the attackers' final act as they succumb to Ezra's arcane missiles at last.

The remaining murlocs finally join the battle. Three of them throw spears at the fire elemental, causing it to collapse in a rush of flame, leaving a pair of smoldering bracers melting into the sand, and three others attack the paladin, one of them scoring a lucky hit.

Zul'Houngan steps to Jonas' side, and slams his mace against the ground, sending a tremor through the earth in the direction of the advancing Murlocks. The hut collapses in on them as they approach, however, two murlocks leap out to safety, leaving the third as so much carnage with the former home.

The raven's distraction is timely, and Jonah takes full advantage. Once again ignoring the ropes that bind his arms, he swings his longsword with spirit-blessed skill, lopping the creature's arm neatly off and sending the blade deep into its torso. With one last gurgle, the creature slides off his sword and falls lifeless to the ground.

The wizard shouts "One is hidden! Watch out!" Muttering some nonsense syllables and making a meaningless hand gesture - for the paladin's benefit - he transmutates into a cloud of sand, rushing forward to wash over the surviving murlocs.

The party looks in the direction Ezra is pointing, and sees another murloc that had been creeping between the huts, trying to remain unseen. It looks larger than the others, and burlier - more like the warrior caste that they remember from the keep.

The appearance of the swarm sends the murlocs into confusion. The two murlocs caught in Ezra's swarm can do nothing but stagger out of the cloud, choking and coughing and trying to clear their bulbous eyes. Another murloc tries to throw a spear at the cloud of dust, only to find that it passes through harmlessly. Meanwhile, another group of murlocs circles round, trying to deal with the rest of the attackers, one of them successfully trapping the troll shaman in a net...

...only to have the net deftly sundered by Jonah's longsword as the paladin steps forward, still ignoring the strands that tangle his own body. "Here. You need this more than I do," says the holy warrior.

Zul'Houngan waits as Jonas calls out his intent. As he's freed from the rope prison, he steps down to the south, and flays his fingers out in the familiar pattern, spraying an arc of fire from his fingertips. Unfortunatly the Murdock's notice what's coming, and manage to miss the major effects of the barrage.

Nevertheless, one of the murlocs had already been charred by the fire elemental's earlier assault, and the shaman's own flaming attack proves too much for it to bear.

Realizing that it has been spotted, the lurking murloc rises from its crouch, and rushes to the cooking fire in the center of the village. It grabs a burning branch from the flames and runs forward, waving it in the air.

The chaotic whirlwind of sand and dust moves away from the lit torch - the only real danger to it on this battlefield - to swallow up one of the hapless murlocs.

Another murloc emerges from hiding and follows the example of its fellow, grabbing a branch from the fire and charging toward the swarm. It cannot know for sure that fire will damage the thing, but it could see that a spear did nothing, and saw that it moved away from its companion's flames.

The other murlocs press the attack, with two of them fruitlessly throwing spears at Jonah, another lurching from the cloud to swing blindly at the shaman, and two more attempting - and one succeeding - to wrap Zul'Houngan in their nets.

Jonah steps forward and cuts the shaman free again. "We've got to stop meeting like this," he says wryly.

Zul'Houngan steps back from the sickly looking thing, and pulls a small lump of transfixed metal from his pouch. Throwing it in the air, it begins to spark and crackle, whizzing around the Troll with blue white lightning light effects, whizzing and snarling through the air.

While a rake of the raven's claws mark the last moments of the murloc confronting Zul'Houngan, Ezra's sandstorm buffets at one of the sneaky murlocs who thought to bring a torch to hurt him. The flame flickers as it swings, and the dust is unaffected.

The cloud of dust moves, and in its wake, two more murlocs are left coughing and choking.

A second murloc runs into the cloud and begins waving its burning brand around. For a moment the torch happens to collide with a billow of dust, which sizzles and smolders, but diminishes the size of the swarm only by a fractional amount. Clearly, mundane fire is not especially effective - but it's all these murlocs can bring to bear.

More spears fly, but only one finds its mark, landing a glancing blow on Zul'Houngan. Meanwhile, one of the murlocs caught in Ezra's cloud staggers out, clawing at its bulging eyes and choking, clearly close to death's door.

One murloc is foolish enough to step too close to Jonah and swing its trident at him. With the raven fluttering about its head, Jonah has no trouble stepping forward and dealing it a grievous wound.

Zul'Houngan runs up to the murloc left out in the flank, before he decides to go back to those nets. He raises his Mace over his head, and clonks it down on the murloc's shoulder with a satisfying crunch.

One of the murlocs drops his torch, realizing that it has no hope of doing any serious damage to the swarm, and decides to slaughter as many warmbloods as it can before it goes down. Drawing a trident, it swings and spears the troll shaman on its tines.

The dust swarm curls about the two murlcs assaulting the troll, wrapping them in a suffocating cloud. So far in this fight, the wizard reflects, he's been more successful as a monster than as a wizard. Perhaps dust full-time..

Behind Ezra, the other murloc drops his torch as well and charges Jonah. Taking advantage of the paladin's entangled state, he manages to stab the paladin soundly, eliciting a grunt from the human.

The murlocs encircle Jonah, one of them managing to get another lucky shot in thanks to the net, and another one only succeeding in further opening the wounds that Ezra dealt. Another would have tried to attack Zul'Houngan, but can only manage to do its best to escape from the cloud of tomb dust that encircles it.

Again the bird flutters about, squawking and pecking. The murlocs are forced to waste precious seconds fending it off.

Jonah wheels around, surrounded on all sides, and attacks one of the murlocs behind him, dealing it a heavy blow and sending it reeling.

Zul'Houngan swipes at the Murloc to hie left, but the murloc's belly give shim the signal just in time, and while the creature empties the contents of the latest catch onto the ground, the troll's mace whizzes through the air.

Another murloc staggers out of the Ezra-cloud and tries to swing at the troll, but its vision appears to be obscured by bits of dust still in its eyes, and its swing fails to connect.

While one murloc staggers away, Ezra pulls his cloud north, sweeping over two of the murlocs that thought to attack Jonah. The paladin is nearly swallowed up himself, but the Forsaken's control is excellent.

The remaining murlocs press the attack, except for the ones that can do nothing but clear the Ezra-dust from their eyes. Jonah and Zul'Houngan are beset and heavily wounded, but not without hope - the attack on Zul'Houngan triggers one of his spirit protectors and nearly incinerates the aggressor.

Jonah turns again and swings his sword, neatly disemboweling the nearest murloc. "We'll... have you... now..." he growls, as he wheels to face his remaining attackers.

Zul'Houngan takes a step backwards, and pulls out his rattle again. Luckily, the spirits are close by, and suddenly his wounds all seem to be closing themselves. His tunic and robe are still bloodstained, but he looks much less the worst for wear.

Even a murloc recognizes that the enemy that can keep himself and his friends alive is the most dangerous enemy of all. The burly murloc steps forward, trident swinging, and even as Zul'Houngan finishes his healing chant, opens a trio of fresh wounds across his belly.

Another murloc comes blundering out of Ezra's dust cloud, as the wizard moves to protect Jonah.

One of the murlocs manages to get another solid hit on Zul'Houngan, but none of them manage to lay a finger (or claw, or fin, or whatever) on Jonah. Indeed, one of them falls over in the exertion of its efforts, and does not get up again.

Jonah's sword lays waste to another murloc, leaving it at death's door, and he turns to focus his attention on the bigger one opposite, grinning ferally. He bleeds from a dozen wounds, but he can see that the tide of battle turns in his favor.

Zul'Houngan's mace swings out and tries to connect with the larger Murloc, flailing wide of it's mark, Zul curses a Troll cure under his breath, and pants.

The murloc that Zul'Houngan faces does not fare much better, swinging its trident and missing utterly.

Now that Jonah is on better footing, Ezra swings south to abrade the murloc facing Zul'Houngan, swallowing it up in the miniature sandstorm.

Jonah is still beset by two murlocs, of course, and one of them takes a swipe at the paladin, but the raven swoops down, pecking at its bulbous eyes, and the creature of the deep loses its aim as it tries to protect itself.

The lesser murlocs, determined creatures that they are, ignore their wounds and fight, swinging viciously and bringing their last... but one of them manages to score a horrible wound on the troll shaman before it expires.

"ZUL'HOUNGAN!" yells Jonah, as he sees his friend go down before the murloc assault. Inspired by righteous fury, he swings his sword, ripping the murloc before him to pieces with a single swing, then charges toward the murloc still standing over Zul'Houngan's fallen form.

And the cry is echoed from the bushes. "Zul'Houngan!" howls Alea'sha from the bushes, having returned - just in the nick of time - from scouting the coastline further up the field. She rushes forward and calls upon the spirits of nature to bestow their blessings upon Zul'Houngan.

Zul'Houngan brings his mace down in a beautiful curved arch right into the Murloc's back.

Growling, the creature steps out of Ezra's cloud and stumbles to face Zul'Houngan, swinging its trident in a wide arc and taking a chunk of the troll's newly restored green flesh with it.

The Forsaken isn't done with the murloc yet. It sweeps between Jonah and Zul'Houngan, howling with fury. Still, the murloc is somewhat too fast to hold the full brunt of the attack.

Ezra's faithful familiar isn't far behind its master, aiding its small but useful part in the battle by keeping the shaman safe.

Ezra says, "actually it can get on the other side of ZH no problem"

Jonah makes as if to enter the cloud, but quickly finds that Ezra cannot prevent his dust from injuring anyone who enters, be they friend or foe. Instead, the paladin circles around the cloud to swing at the murloc, failing to do any damage but keeping it on its toes.

Zul'Houngan steps backwards, sliding around to try and avoid that sharp trident. He pulls the last of his materials out of his pouch, and prays to the spirits again to mend and close his wounds.

The sea-creature coughs and chokes, but stumbles out of the cloud of dust again, swinging its trident and wounding the troll once more just as he finishes yet another healing chant.

The cloud of dust, having narrowed the field and now being counterproductive to final clean-up, coalesces back into the body of the grinning arcanist, who raises his weapon to fend off any counterattack from the remaining murloc.

Zul'Houngan's arm continues the movement from the spell, gracefully pulling the Mace around in a sideways arc, and lunging it into the murloc's side.

The murloc, its ribs crushed and its internal organs perforated, tries to lift its trident, falls to its knees, and then falls on the sand, its life extinguished.

Jonah finally cuts the net free from his body and sheathes his sword. "These murlocs fight like demons," he comments, looking out to sea. "I suppose you have a plan to deal with the naga, sir?" he says, peering at Ezra with a touch of suspicion.

"We do," smiles Ezra.
