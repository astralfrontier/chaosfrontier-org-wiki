# Turning Tides 2008-03-15

The murlocs of Sandfin Village are defeated... and there is plenty of time to plan for the arrival of Lady Val'jara. And, of course, there is time to search the village for anything of interest; in this case, this includes a rusted old locker bearing a half-corroded crest whose provenance is uncertain but seems to come from Ratchet. This is found in the largest hut in the village, presumably that of the murloc chieftain, and contains a smattering of precious stones, a golden ring, a cloth headband with an exquisitely cut precious gem bound to it, and two scrolls in worn but intact leather scroll-cases.

Meanwhile, Ezra has been plotting to deal with Val'jara's arrival, as an empty murloc village will be bound to raise suspicion, and he has a plan.

The Forsaken's plan is devious, deceptive, and relies on a patsy who will lead men to their doom. In this regard it's typical of the Forsaken - if you believe the lies told about them, of course. Alea'sha, disguised with gills and other marks of infection by the Old God, will approach Lady Val'jara when she arrives, telling her a tale designed to provoke a sense of urgency.

The tale will be that the orcs of Razor Hill have the naga chalice, that they are experimenting on it and have perhaps found a way to easily reverse its effects. She will tell the naga that Andreas - having "escaped" from the Horde and returned to Tiragarde - is planning a raid to retrieve the chalice.

Jonah has begun to wonder about Ezra, but this plan at least meets with his wholehearted approval. "The naga may be far indeed from the Light," he says, "but I am glad that we have a chance to succeed without simply slaughtering her."

And thus, preparations are made. Zul'Houngan, Jonah, and the wolf find places to hide in the undergrowth, just within sight of the former murloc village. Ezra finds a similar place to hide, so that he can use his magic to cloak his own form and disguise Alea'sha's. And Alea'sha takes her place, waiting for the storm to come.

The sun is low on the hills behind them when a new ripple can be spotted in the surf beyond the breakwater. Two ripples, in fact. Alea'sha feels the tingle of Ezra's illusionary magic around her just as the ripples break the surface and reveal themselves to be an imperious-looking female naga, with a four-armed male close behind her. Both of them are instantly wary as no murlocs rush to greet them, and as they see Alea'sha, they move forward, murder in their eyes.

Alea'sha tries to recall the exact way those under the effects of the mystic disease held themselves and duplicates it. She has a sense of discomfort, and uses that feeling to show the sense of unease the victim of a raid ought to show. For the moment, her gaze is downcast and her posture changes subtly to that of a servant caught in a most unfortunate situation.

As Alea'sha makes no move to defend herself, the charge of the naga is slowed. Instead, they draw up to the water's edge. The female calls out, "You! What happened here? Where are the villagerssss?"

Alea recoils as if struck by the voice. She forces herself to stand at less of a slump, but still looks rather like a whipped cur. "Gone, all gone," she says. "The orcs have come."

"And why do you ssstand here, elf?" hisses the naga. She looks closer, and her lips turn up in a smile. "I ssssseee..." she says with evident glee. "You have become one of us. Let me have a look..." She emerges from the water and her serpentine lower half propels her toward Alea'sha, one hand outstretched; her retainer is close behind, his three swords still drawn.

Alea widens her eyes as the naga reaches out, a slave misinterpreting the gesture and shrinking away. "There is m-more.." Her voice is low as she explains, "The chalice is gone. Soon they will know how to remove its blessing."

The naga - presumably Lady Val'jara herself - rears back and hisses. "What?!" she demands. "They stole the chalice? The blasphemerssss! Tell me how you know this, and quickly!"

"You have come in time to deliver us," whispers Alea, now almost sprawling on the ground she is so low. "Andreas is at the keep. We must get it back." She draws a ragged breath, "The orcs do not know yet. I was a failure in their attempts, but I escaped." She shows a wrist, scarred where she sawed ropes across her flesh to complete the disguise.

The naga examines the wrist-burns, and nods. "Well done..." She chuckles. "So Andreasss esssscaped too," she adds. "That is excellent. Perhapssss he can recommend sssome likely men to infiltrate the warmbloods' camp to retrieve it..."

The face of Alea looks pained as she speaks, "They will be on a far greater watch now that there has been an escape." She drags her fingers across the ground, clawing at it. "And if the men are caught, there will be no more chances. They will move it far away."

Val'jara's eyes narrow. "Ssso what do you think we ssshould do, my child?" she says sarcastically. "Sssend all our armiesss against Razor Hill, sssubmerge it under the tide of their own blood, and pluck the chalice from the wreckage?" There is a glimmer in her eyes as she speaks this - clearly she finds the idea tempting. "Do we have the numbersss in Tiragarde for that?"

Alea looks up hopefully at the suggestion. "Andreas says it can be done," she says, excitement putting a quiver in her voice. "We will get it back and they will be a lesson to others who think to stand against us!"

The naga seems satisfied. "Well done," she says, glaring about the silent village. "A ssshame you could not have come in time to sssave my Sssandfin servantsss." She looks Alea'sha up and down. "From what you have told me, we have no time to wassste. I had planned to rest here, but I sssee that I shall have to swim for Tiragarde as fassst as I can. And alasss, your assscension is not yet complete; you cannot keep up with usss. Return to Tiragarde as fassst as your accursed legs can take you, and pray for the day when you will be cursssed with them no more." With that, Val'jara turns about and returns to the surf, her bodyguard accompanying her.

Once the naga is safely gone, Ezra emerges from his invisibility. His raven alights on his outstretched arm as he draws close to Alea'sha. The gills fade. "Well done," he murmurs.

Zul'Houngan steps out as Ezra emerges, tapping Jonas and the wolf to stand as well, he grunts affirmativly as he steps forward.

"It seemed to get the job done," says Alea. She reaches out to pat the back of the wolf. "Now it is all up to the others to deal with what we have let loose. Do you think it will be messy?"

Ezra shakes his head. "Unless Andreas fails, the humans of Tiragarde will live, and be purified. All that will be left are the murlocs and the naga. That.... will not be so clean."

"War is always messy," adds Jonah. "But if the potions Zul'Houngan's kinsmen have made do their work, my men at least will be safe." He smiles. "You did well, Alea'sha. For a moment, I almost believed myself that you had been turned."

"War," says Alea softly. "Always we go back to that old invention." She laughs at Jonah and says, "I have been in uglier circumstances than this before. Sometimes creative interpretations of the truth are more powerful than swords or magic."

Zul interjects. "A few battles is not a war. If we can avoid such a thing, it will be worth it."

By the time the party returns to Tiragarde the next morning, the keep is already preparing to march. Troupes of soldiers, human and murloc, are assembling on the sand behind the keep, with Val'jara and Andreas standing before them to review them. To one side, several carts are being loaded with large casks, with two other naga beside them - the male they had seen before, accompanied by another, smaller female in leather armor.

Jonah nods. "Excellent," he whispers, counting heads. "Looks like Andreas talked her into bringing the whole human contingent. She'll probably have left some murlocs to defend the keep itself, but we can worry about that later." And with that, the party simply watches as the forces are ordered into marching formation and set out inland, for Razor Hill.

Finally, the night before the raid, Andreas makes camp in the spot he'd agreed on before. It is a tactically advantageous position - well hidden from Razor Hill, so that had they been unaware, the orcs would have little warning before the humans struck. It also is located near the cache of troll-concocted soporific that had been prepared for them.

Val'jara is a proud leader, but she clearly trusts Andreas well enough to let him direct battle to his satisfaction. Had she been less trusting, she might have wondered why he chose to place the supply carts close to the edge of the camp. There are guards, of course, including the other female naga, who stares into the night, careful to keep the campfires from ruining her night vision.

Ezra is ready. While Zul'Houngan bore the brunt of the spellcasting during the battle in Sandfin Village, and Alea'sha bore the psychic burden of deceiving the naga, the Forsaken arcanist will be the one to apply the poison. Accordingly, he waits for an opportune moment. The naga will become tired and complacent, as all thinking beings will tend to do when at a boring post. At that moment, he becomes invisible and draws near the camp. Meanwhile, Alea'sha's wolf - seemingly just a wild animal - will create a distraction for the guards to think about.

Things go without a hitch. No one sees or even hears Ezra approach the cart. Especially when, as he draws near, there is a well-timed howl from Alea'sha's friend, and a gray blur in the night as he rushes by. The naga snaps into action. "You, and you! Go hunt that down!" she orders, gesturing to a human and a murloc, who dash off into the night. As the naga stares in the direction the wolf went, no one notices the bundles of seething green liquid as they bob across the hard-packed clay at ankle level, then float up beside the seawater barrels.

By the time the last bottle of soporific uncorks itself and pours its contents into a barrel, the human and murloc are returning. "Well?" demands the naga. "Jusssst an animal," replies the murloc. "We could not catch it." The naga narrows her eyes, and then shrugs, returning to her watch, even as the empties dance their way across the ground and vanish again as they return to Ezra's hand.

The troll witch doctors did their job well. As the troops, both human and murloc, line up at the barrels for their rations, none of them notice any funny flavor to the water they drink, or even any symptoms, right away. This gives Ezra time to send his familiar to the orc encampment, bearing a note that the trap is set. Shortly after, the Tiragarde contingent is caught unawares by the deep blast of an orc war horn, followed by a charge of war-painted orcs.

As humans and murlocs turn to face the charge, they find themselves unexpectedly groggy and disoriented, and can barely raise their weapons in defense. The orcs are true to their word; humans who resist are simply stunned with a war club and netted, while the bloody death of their war axes is reserved for the fish-men.

Val'jara is livid; she and her entourage are seemingly unaffected, as is Andreas. "Fight, you cowardssss! Andreas, call your troops to-" Those are her last words, as Andreas drives his sword deep into her chest. The dying naga's eyes bulge with rage, and then with the shock of recognition as Andreas removes his scarf, allowing her to see, in her last moments, that he is free of the curse. Her two companions rush Andreas, only to be overtaken by the orcs who come to his defense.

Within minutes, it is all over. Murloc corpses litter the ground, with less than a dozen human or orc corpses among them; the rest of the humans are well-trussed, some of them still half-awake enough to spit curses at the orcs who are binding them. Andreas is avoiding them for the moment, knowing that they are still subject to the will of the Old Gods. Most of them will thank him when the troll shamans have freed them; some will not. But in any case, free they will be.

Jonah is shaking hands with Andreas and Orgnil Soulscar. "We're grateful to you, Orgnil," he says. "Thanks to you, the curse of the Old Gods has been freed from my countrymen."

Orgnil nods. "There is still the matter of Tiragarde Keep itself," he says. "Now that we have your men, Andreas..." The orc looks apologetic. "I do not know if we could allow your men to return on their own."

Andreas nods grimly. "I know," he says. "But there are still murlocs in the Keep. I do not like the idea of them keeping that fortress for themselves. Fortunately..." he says, gesturing at the slain naga, "For the moment, they are leaderless and vulnerable."

Orgnil scratches his head. "You have a point," he says. "It is a defensible location, though. And I'm sure the naga left sufficient force to hold it against my men." He raises a bushy eyebrow. "I wonder... would your troops follow you into battle if you ordered them to fight _alongside_ us?"

"After what the Old Gods have done to them?" says Andreas. "Not all, perhaps... but enough. But if you ask for my help, I would ask something in return." Orgnil tilts his head inquisitively, and Andreas continues. "If our combined forces are to recapture Tiragarde, then let our combined forces _hold_ it, as an outpost against further invasions from the Sea. Those men who will follow me will return there, and orcs will serve alongside them to ensure that we do not turn against you again."

"And those humans who do not follow you?" asks Orgnil.

Jonas speaks up. "Then they are renegades and rebels against the rule of Theramore," he says. "Jaina Proudmoore will find some way to deal with them. By your leave, of course."

Orgnil is not entirely happy with this, but grunts assent. "Whatever we may think of your kind as a whole, Jaina is a woman of honor. If she agrees to ensure that they will not threaten our lands again, that will suffice."

"And what of the chalice?" says Jonah. "That is an artifact of great evil, but studying it will be invaluable."

"My shamans will study it," says Orgnil. "Razor Hill is strong enough to defend it, especially once the murlocs' hold on the Keep has been broken."

"Its power is insidious." Ezra speaks quietly, having remained silent during the boring parts of this conversation. "If Razor Hill became corrupted, how would the rest of Durotar be safe? Don't say such careless things."

"Then what would you suggest, o mercenary mage?" says Orgnil, regarding Ezra suspiciously. "In whose hands do you think such a thing will be safe?"

Alea looks hesitant to cause disruption when it seems that humans and orcs were starting to take major steps together, but in this regard, she feels compelled. "I could take it to the Blue Dragonflight. I know in time we might puzzle out many things concerning our enemy with the chalice, but I think they would find our answers more quickly, and they may already know exactly what we are up against. I doubt any of us is optimistic enough to believe this is the end of conflict with the murlocs and naga."

The human and orc leaders seem astonished. "You can make contact with the _dragons_?" asks Jonah. "To be sure, I cannot think of anyone better to take such a thing, but I would not know where to begin to find them."

"I can," says Alea. She is pleased that the suggestion is so well-received. "I will take it to them, if that is your wish. If you wish to send men to travel with me, that is understandable, provided they will follow my orders. The Blue Dragonflight does not allow strangers to wander into their territory freely."

Orgnil scratches his head, and then nods. "I don't think I can make this decision on my own... something like this is too big for me. But I will send word to Orgrimmar with your suggestion." Jonah likewise nods in agreement. "And I will send word to Theramore. They too will want to know of this."

"If they decide to send men with me, make sure they are prepared for travel in cold places," says Alea. "It is not an easy journey, but I rather doubt we will be pursued by Murlocs or Naga where we are going."

Orgnil nods. "I will mention this. Will you remain in Razor Hill until we hear back?"

"I will wait here," says Alea. "But I urge you to find the answers swiftly. This is too close to the sea. We can't let them get that chalice back."

"Good enough," says Orgnil. "And besides, we still need to discuss how to reward you three for the outstanding service you've performed. Razor Hill is now safe from Daelin's folly, thanks to you - and although we face a new threat now, you've also helped us prepare for that as well."
