It takes some time for a messenger to get from Razor Hill to Orgrimmar, but it takes rather longer for decisions to be made. In the interim, Orgnil and Andreas spend much of their time working together on the plans to retake and hold Tiragarde, with Jonah assisting. In the meantime, the chalice itself is kept in Orgnil's stronghold, with guards posted at all times, lest the murlocs manage to organize another raid.

However, by the morning after the naga's defeat, a Forsaken messenger arrives from the north, his skeletal steed an unnerving, though not entirely unfamiliar, sight for the orcs. Whoever it is, it seems that they wish to have a personal audience with someone named Ezra L. Pyreborn.

The messenger is directed to the temporary quarters which have been set aside for Ezra and his companions. He stares at Alea'sha, then at Zul'Houngan. "I bear a message for Ezra and Ezra alone," he says, politely yet coldly.

Ezra holds up a hand. "We'll take a walk," he offers. "My companions are tired, yess.."

The Forsaken messenger's milky eyes glint, but after a moment, he nods. "Very well," he says, leading Ezra out of the barracks. "While we walk, please read this note," he says, handing Ezra an envelope bearing the seal of the Royal Apothecary Society.

Ezra cracks the seal with talon-like fingertips, saying nothing yet.

The note reads, in carefully printed letters: "Chalice must be returned to Undercity immediately. Couriers dispatched to collect item. Do not study it any further. Under no circumstances allow anyone other than bearer of this seal to retain possession. Embrace the Shadow. - DANIEL BATES" Below the message is a complicated arcane sigil with the Royal Apothecary Society's logo embedded in its runes.

By the time Ezra finishes reading the note, the messenger has led him to a quiet part of the orc village. "Can we count on your support?" he hisses softly.

Ezra closes the note up and stuffs it into the pocket of his coat, chuckling softly. "Word travels faster than thought, sometimes. I must devise a plan. There are many eyes and many grasping hands here. You understand, yes."

The messenger narrows his eyes. "Yes, of course. But do not take too long. Rumor has reached us that there are plans being considered to send it out of Horde lands altogether. This must _not_ be allowed to happen. And orcs are a people of action. It will not take them much longer to reach a decision."

"I have their trust. I will use my strength to do this." And Ezra means it, although he has not said everything in his thoughts.

"Very well," says the messenger. "You have until tomorrow evening." And with that, the Forsaken stalks away.

As Ezra considers his next move, he tries to place the name 'Daniel Bates'. After a moment's cogitation, he remembers him as a specialist in diseases with the Apothecary Society - but not in charge of the diseases department as a whole, nor does he have any particular position of authority over Ezra.

Ezra arrives back at the leather-and-wood accommodations made available to the small group courtesy of the orcs. 'Shelter from the rain' has been an adequate substitute for 'comfort', although Ezra hardly seems to be bothered by the lack of amenities. He's positively chortling with glee as he greets Alea'sha and Zul'Houngan.

"So, my friends... I have something to say." The mage takes a cross-legged seat between the two naturalists, smiling in his sinister fashion. "You both know me, yes? Know who and what I am?"

Zul'Houngan blinks, and looks the Forsaken over. He smiles, toothily (As if a troll can really smile any other way.) "Well, I tink so. But, given you. Who knows..."

"I think I know you," says Alea, though she won't say how far. "What is it that has you in such a fine mood?"

Ezra laughs. It's a hideous thing, something that shouldn't be repeated. "Just this. I go with the faith of my companions sustaining me. Even Jonah. Tell him that for me, please." And he whirls, walking quickly away.

"Did I miss something?" asks Alea. She looks to the troll, "Is this a joke that I don't understand?"

Zul'Houngan shrugs, "It seems that his whole life is a joke noone gets." He shrugs.

The druid sighs and looks after Ezra curiously, "I only hope that he is safe. I worry for his kind. The more I understand them, the more curious I am what their fate might be."

And Alea'sha realizes something. Whether the spirits of nature breathed it into her ear, or just a basic understanding of people in general and Ezra in particular, she guesses that Ezra is about to do something that he can't discuss even with them, and hopes that his companions will understand that he is doing what he thinks is right.

"Hmmm.." Alea smiles to herself, "Yes, I think so. He's hiding something that he can't share. I think he is doing the right thing, even though he may not be so certain himself just yet."

Zul'Houngan huhs, and silently nods to Alea.

---

"Who goes there?" asks the orc guard outside the chalice's chamber. "Oh, it's you. What do you want?" Ezra smiles. "May I study the chalice?" he asks, to which the orc grunts assent, admitting Ezra into the chamber beyond and resuming his guarding duties.

After a while, the orc begins to wonder about the lack of any noises from within the room, and knocks on the door. "What's going on in there?" he asks, and then opens it. Ezra is missing... as is the chalice; even the lead-lined box it had been stored in is gone. Within minutes, the village is in an uproar; though no one can seem to decide whether Ezra was a victim or the perpetrator of the heist, the consensus is: find Ezra, and the chalice.

An armed orc bursts into Alea'sha and Zul'Houngan's room. "Where is he? Where is the mage that was with you?" he demands.

Alea looks up and sighs, "I do not know. He is gone, but I think he will return." She frowns in thought, "He left us some time ago. Why? What has happened?"

"The chalice is missing, and so's he," says the orc. "Did he tell you anything? Any idea where he might've intended to go?"

"He did not say where he meant to go," says Alea, looking puzzled. "Why would he take the chalice? We had all agreed." She does not sound alarmed, but confused. "There must be a reason, though I can't fathom it."

Zul'Houngan snarls a but under his breath, "Sometimes the humans don't trust us so much. Perhaps he has flown with it back to his order."

The orc snarls in return, his own fangs showing. "You think he might have stolen it? Where was he from, again?"

Zul'Houngan shrugs to himself, "He didn't ever say. Not that I really asked him his business too much..."

The orc scowls. "You were travelin' with a human, and ya didn't ask something like that? Don't you know better'n to trust a human?" Whatever Orgnil's opinions, amongst the common grunt old prejudices die hard.

Zul'Houngan blinks, "You think he would have told me the truth?" He chuckles, "I just didn't want to get involved too closely. I'm kind of glad now..." He trails off.

Alea just listens to this exchange, trying not to get annoyed or excessively amused by the orc's words. She has to think this through. Why did Ezra take the chalice, and where did he go?

The orc snorts. "Good point," he says. "I'd better go check back. If he comes to you, hold him an' try to get the chalice back, okay?" And with that, the orc departs.

Zul'Houngan looks over at Alea, "I feel we may have overstayed Ezra's welcome..." He starts to pack his things.

"Leaving now would be risky," replies Alea. "He will come back, and we have no clue where to find him, anyway. If Ezra felt our presence would help his cause, he'd have invited us." She thinks.

Zul'Houngan looks back at Alea. "The next one they send may not be as orcish." He shrugs, "And I somehow doubt that Ezra would come back here, anyway." He thinks too, "We probably should look for his bird..."

"If we can find the bird, I will be surprised," says Alea. "Or perhaps we are meant to have some knowledge if we seek it." She rises and turns to Zul'Houngan, "Shall we?"

It doesn't take long for Zul'Houngan and Alea'sha to spot the black nameless raven that accompanies their (former?) ally. Ezra usually kept it out of sight, but Zul'Houngan remembers it clearly from Sandfin Village - its frenzied flurry of wings and beak were of some help fighting the murlocs. For now it's perched atop one of the outlying fences, pecking at something or other.

Zul'Houngan wanders over to the bird with Alea, looking around a bit to see if they're being watched / followed and or whatever.

The bird squawks, fluttering its wings a bit in a dramatic preparation for takeoff. Then it launches itself into the air, gliding north-northwest. About a hundred yards away it lands and cranes its neck backwards.

Two black eyes watch the elf and the troll. It seems to be looking at them and waiting.

Zul'Houngan looks to Alea, and shrugs. "I guess we follow."

Two orc guards halt Zul'Houngan and Alea'sha at the northern gate. "Where are you going?" he asks. "Everyone's looking for that human mage! You should be helping!"

"My wolf's nose doesn't work well with so many bodies about, and my tracking is useless where so many clumsy feet have stumbled. I must move outside the city for either to be of any use," says Alea'sha. "Besides, do you really think the mage is skulking about here?"

The higher-ranked of the two guards nods and draws his battle-axe back. "Very well then," he says. "Go on, and good hunting."

Shortly after the troll and elf depart from the gates, checking behind them for pursuit, they realize that someone is following behind them. It appears to be an armored human, though difficult to identify from this distance, and he is evidently trying to follow their tracks.

The druid and shaman decide to find cover and await for their pursuer to approach closer before deciding what to do. Their plan is successful; in the gathering darkness, the human's torch only reaches far enough to let him follow the trail without uncovering the people who made it. And in the light of the torch, they can quickly see that it is Jonah. "Alea? Zul? Are you there?" he calls every so often.

Alea'sha lets out a soft sigh of relief. She moves into the torchlight, "Jonah, how did you know to follow us? It's a rather strange time for a walk, don't you think?"

Zul'Houngan follows behind Alea, but says nothing, simply looking at the Paladin. It's a bit more weary then Alea. But not a lot so...

"I followed you from your barracks," says Jonah. "The gate guards told me you'd gone this way. I thought... well, you two had traveled with the mage. Do you have any idea what he's up to?"

"I'm not sure," says Alea. "But I have a feeling he's navigating dangerous territory, and.. I think he may want us to follow his bird to see if he needs help." She manages to smile, despite the rather unlikely story, "I think our fate is never to walk the normal road. If you want to come with us, you are welcome, Jonah. I can't promise it will be a very safe journey."

Jonah nods. "I did not take up the mantle of the Holy Light so that I could only embark on safe journeys," he says with a grin.

It is well into the evening before the bird finally ceases its flight, after leading its charges into a deep chasm that forms part of the road between Razor Hill and Orgrimmar. It perches on the branches of a withered tree and begins to groom its feathers.

The parched soil of Durotar is unforgiving to the unprepared. It holds its share of secrets, for this is the land in which the orcs hone themselves against the elements and against the spirits. The dust under the feet of the travelers has its own secret too. As they sit and make camp, it rises into a sudden whirlwind. The momentary cloud coalesces into the bandaged form of Ezra. His bird alights on his shoulder. And there is a leaden box under one arm.

Alea'sha is a bit surprised at first, but recovers smoothly. "I hope you can explain now," she says quietly. "You've given us a bit of a scare, and our orc friends are taking it hard."

Jonah jumps up, eyes wide. "You're Forsaken!" he says to Ezra in astonishment, then: "You were the mage that was working with Alea'sha and Zul'Houngan back in Bael Modan, weren't you? I was wondering why you weren't with them!"

Ezra just cackles.

Zul'Houngan looks at Ezra. He looks down a the box, and sighs. What has the mage gotten us into this time?

Jonah's eyes narrow, and his hand goes to his sword hilt. "Alea'sha is right. I think you'd better explain yourself." He nods in the direction of the box. "The chalice, I assume."

The Forsaken creature drops into a crouch, his coat draping onto the rocky soil around him, his hat's brim hiding his glowing eyes. "Of _course_ the chalice. You want it. Orgrimmar wants it." He withdraws the rolled-up note from his pocket and flings it onto the ground. "See who else wishes to have it."

Alea'sha leans down to pick up the note, reading it quickly. "I wish I were so popular," she mutters softly. "So now what do we do? Take it straight to the dragons with the whole world at our heels?"

Jonah reads the note over Alea'sha's shoulder. "So you were taking it to them-" he begins, snarling, then breaks off. "But that makes no sense. Why have your bird lead us to you?"

Ezra cackles again. "This man who adjures me is not my superior, you see," he explains. "I wish to know if he acts alone or with the connivance of ... others, higher placed, yesss. I _must_ know. This is too important to be left to.. the unimportant." He pats the burden under his arm. "So... I will be captured, attempting to flee Durotar. I will be taken to one of Thrall's advisors, perhapsss. You must see to these things with me. I cannot betray the Dark Lady, if this is her wish. But neither will I betray the Horde."

"This is going to get very complicated," says Alea'sha. "Do you mean for us to apprehend you and bring you back then?" Now she's getting dizzy. "We would be able to take you to any advisor you like, but I'm not sure what they'd make of this little note. I think maybe it should be tucked away."

"Let us say that I am introducing a note of ammmbiguity to the proceedings." Ezra smiles. "You will have tracked me to Orgrimmar. You will be there to intercept me as I prepare to leave. Orgnil will of coursse confirm that this is of interest to the Warchief."

Zul'Houngan shakes his head, "So, what exactly do you think to gain by stiring all of these factions up?"

"They are already being stirred," Ezra points out. "If I had ssstolen the chaliccce, returned as I was requested, what do you ssuppose would have happened?"

"The horde might have fractured, depending on how badly things went," says Alea'sha. "It is hard to say just how serious things may have become."

"An interesting question, to be sure." He shrugs, "But who are we to decide the fate of the Chalice, anyway?" He looks at Ezra. Somewhat distrustfully.

"Who else do you nominate?" Ezra replies bitterly. "Who elsse sufficiently understands the menace?"

Alea sighs. She's going to do that often, she suspects. "Fighting is pointless. I think we had better decide just where we want this chalice to end-up, since those in power seem to have difficult positions."

Zul'Houngan's eyes look back at Ezra. "Perhaps we do understand better." He looks around, "I think Ezra is right, somewhat. We need to find out exactly who wants the thing, and exactly what they plan before we relinquish it."

The mage nods. "Jussssst so. Now, will you aid me?"

Jonah grimaces. "At least Ezra didn't just turn it over to Undercity, like they asked. That's something." He stares into the night sky, pondering. "And if you're going _against_ the Undercity in this, you're going to need all the aid you can get." And the paladin grins.

The troll shrugs, "I would rather see the thing destroyed than studied or in someone else's hands."

"There may be consequences in its destruction that we cannot see," replies Alea'sha. "That is why I wished to go to the Blue Dragonflight. They might know that answer."

Ezra laughs darkly. "Tell me... if it _was_ the Dark Lady's wish... do you think I'd take it after all?" He pauses. "But enough of ssuch idle speculation, yess. Unproductive thinking. Now. Please continue to Orgrimmar."

---

Orgrimmar is a thriving metropolis, swarming with orcs and the occasional troll. Jonah's presence causes some comment with the gate guards, but things go smoother when Zul'Houngan agrees to take responsibility for his actions.

The three travelers head straight for the giant zeppelin tower at the center of town. As the locus of transportation to the Eastern continent, it's the natural place for someone to go if they were trying to smuggle something to the Undercity.

It isn't hard to pick out the non-orc in the pack of people milling about on the zeppelin tower. Boarding is always arduous, and the thin flicker of black amidst the sea of green is conspicuous. At the appointed hour, Alea'sha, Zul'Houngan, and Jonah are at the tower. They see nothing more than a human with a hat slung over his face, with a black bird astride his shoulder.

Zul'Houngan shows up just a little bit later with the druid and wolf in tow. What an odd party they make. He points to the human trying to board there. "Stop him! For the Horde!" He hells, and starts running after Ezra.

The man wheels, obviously in a panic at being discovered. He clutches his hat and tries to force his way through the crowd.

Alea'sha feels a bit silly doing this, but she can play her part. It's too important. She races through the crowd, but the wolf is faster and stronger, closing the gap and snarling and barking so loudly that the people are scattered before it.

Jonah emerges from the crowd. "Stop right there!" he calls, and raises his emblem of the Holy Light theatrically. It is recognizable as a gesture of turning, but only those who are sensitive to such things - such as Ezra - will recognize that he has not put the force of will behind it.

On cue, the disguise writhes and falls away. The bandaged Forsaken, thus revealed, falls to the ground grasping at his chest with one white-wrapped claw.

Zul'Houngan's feet pound into the pavement,a s he runs after Ezra, "Get back here!" He cries, as he places one arm on Ezra's shoulder, trying to drag the forsaken back to him, "You thought you could get away?"

Ezra snarls in impotent rage at his captors, but it's clear that he's been apprehended.

By this time, the orc guards at the tower base have gotten into the act. "What's the meaning of this!" yells one of them, clanging his axe against his shield, the clamor drawing several more guards in the livery of Orgrimmar to the scene. "Who are you people, and what is this Forsaken supposed to have done?" Behind him, the other guards fan out, intending to lay hands on everyone. It's clear that they intend to arrest everyone and let the loremasters sort it out.

Zul'Houngan looks up to the Orc guard, "He stoke a very valuable artifact from Razor Hill! The warchief will need to be informed." He points to the thing that Ezra was carrying. Zul stands firmly, looking at the Orc.

"Is that so? That's a rather serious charge. What say you, Forsaken?" says the orc guard gruffly, glaring at the undead man.

"I demand jussstice!" Ezra says defiantly. "I sserve the Horde. I will not hear their liesss. This _is_ an important relic, but that isss all I will say."

The orc grunts. "Fine," he says. "If that's the way you want it... come with us, all of you." The orcs form up around the four disparate individuals, with two taking particular care to restrain Ezra - although the attitude of the group is clearly that there would be trouble if any of the other three wandered off. It is fortunate, perhaps, for all concerned that they do not intend to do so.

Though the group is taken to the stockade, the guards have been warned to take special care of the item in its lead-lined box. And it is less than half an hour before a burly orc arrives. "All right, you four. The warchief himself wants to see you. Guess that thing really _is_ important, eh?" The Stone Guard - for such is his rank, as they can see on his shoulder - gestures to the box being carried by one of his subordinates.

And so it is that a troll, an elf, a human, and a Forsaken find themselves in the council chamber of Thrall, Warchief of the Horde, with the box under contention resting on the floor beside his chair. "Well now... Ezra Pyreborn, is it?" he says, his voice and gaze level and calm. "You've led us on quite the merry chase, haven't you?"

Ezra withdraws the message from Undercity once again. He steps forward, extending it silently, then falls back.

Thrall peruses the missive, and sighs deeply. "Spirits preserve us," he says in resignation. "_Another_ conspiracy within the Horde. As if we didn't have enough already." He looks up at Ezra. "I must say, you were rather incompetent in carrying out this theft. A little... _too_ incompetent, since no one except your companions seemed to have any notion of where you went after you left Razor Hill." And this time, there is a gleam of amusement in his eyes.

"The beginning of wisdom is to know your limitssss. I sseek the wisdom of the warchief," Ezra says, inclining his head.

"Fair enough," says Thrall. "And so, instead of informing poor Orgnil about this letter, you took it on yourself to spirit the chalice away from Razor Hill, inveighle your companions - including a paladin, I see, strange bedfellows indeed - into following you, and then get caught by them just short of the tower." There is a pause, and then he grins. "Well done."

"The direct approach is hardly ever direct." The troll mumbles.

"So!" says the orc warchief, standing up and pacing around. "Now you have brought this little dilemma into my lap, and now I must decide what to do with it, and you." He sighs and chuckles. "I suppose it can't be helped. Very well then. It seems that I've got some more people to talk to. My guards will see you to your quarters. I think you'll find them much more comfortable than the stockade." He smiles at the group. "And I will want to speak with you in particular, Jonah. I am curious why a follower of the Holy Light would work with the undead."
