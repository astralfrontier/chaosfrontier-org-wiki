# Turning Tides 2008-04-12

The next day, the three companions are led to a smaller meeting hall within Grommash Hold. There, they are greeted by one of Thrall's advisors, who bears curious news: Daniel Bates, the being named in Ezra's note, apparently committed suicide three months ago.

"They found him in his quarters, still holding an empty potion bottle, and with a note on the table beside him," says the orc. "The note said that he feared that he was becoming mindless, and that he must do away with himself lest he become a danger to the Forsaken. His co-workers said that he had grown erratic of late, so that fit."

"The investigators noted that Mr. Bates had requisitioned a positive-energy potion from the Apothecary stores, one of the ones they had accumulated as potential weapons against the Scourge," continues the orc. "Presumably that was the means by which he ended his unlife."

Alea'sha arches an eyebrow at this news. "Curiouser and curiouser," she murmurs. "So then we haven't a clue who might write that note. Or is it possible that they were a bit quick to decide he was truly dead?"

Ezra says nothing about the matter. This simplifies things for him in one sense and complicates them in another.

"A known is replaced with an unknown." Zul says.

"We don't know," admits Thrall's advisor, who had introduced himself as Kardan. "The word we have from Undercity is that they had no reason to question the situation, up until now. They were disappointed at the loss of a skilled apothecary, of course."

"I imagine they will be moving to confirm the death right now," muses Alea'sha. "I am not sure which way will put us more at east, at this point. It seems that there is a leak somewhere, though. That is quite distressing."

"Indeed," says Kardan. "Regardless, it seems that, at the very least, the order to retrieve the chalice was not under _official_ sanction from the Undercity after all. We will be investigating the matter as best we can, of course."

The Forsaken mage finally speaks up. "Asssk the guards from which direction the messssenger rode in from," he says, offhandedly.

Zul'Houngan shrugs. Zul isn't honestly convinced that this is what that means at all. It just means that they found someone to take the fall.

"The messenger that came to you in Razor Hill? We already know that he came into Razor Hill via the north gate. We haven't been able to trace him back any further yet, though we're checking with the Orgrimmar gate guards and the zeppelin masters."

Kardan claps his hands together. "In the meantime, we must decide what is to be done about the chalice. Now that we have been able to study it, we have decided that the blue dragons are indeed the best caretakers for the accursed thing. If we can get them to accept it." He nods to Alea'sha. "You are the one who has had contact with them, are you not? Do you think you could convince them to accept custody of the chalice?"

"I think they will take it and guard it," says Alea'sha. "They will see the need, and they may be able to tell us a great deal about its source. At least, that is my hope. No elf can claim to be a master of dragon lore, after all."

"Few can, of any race," acknowledge Kardan. "Then, we have a mission for you, and for whoever may choose to accompany you. We would like you to seek out the blue dragons and make the request of them. If they agree, then you will activate this." The orc brings forth a box and opens it, revealing a silvery talisman the size of an orc's open palm, decorated with occult runes and with a sapphire set into its face. "When you use the word inscribed under the lid of this box, it will signal one of our mages to travel to you with a guard, bearing the chalice."

"That sounds reasonable. The dragons will want to meet on the edge of their territory, of course," says Alea'sha. "I think we should get started as soon as possible, and with as little chance for further leaks as possible."

"Agreed," says Kardan. "Make whatever preparations you see fit, and return by tomorrow morning." The orc bows, and leads them out of the chamber.

Waiting outside is the paladin Jonah Claremont, who also greets the three with a courtly bow. "Well met, traveling companions," he says, and nods in particular to Ezra. "You have given me much to think about, my friend. I only regret that I cannot accompany you on your travels; but I must return to Theramore swiftly."

Ezra grins his lipless, toothsome smile. "Stay safe."

Zul'Houngan nods to Jonah. "May our next meeting be more favorable."

"Take care of yourself, Jonah. I have a feeling we will meet again someday," says Alea'sha. She pauses a moment, but says nothing further.

Jonah nods and takes his leave, and there is nothing further to impede the three travelers as they prepare for their journey.

The next dawn finds the three at Grommash Hold again, where Kardan greets them and provides them with the summoning talisman. "You may take any route you wish to your destination. This is a test of your strength and courage, but we are confident that you are up to the challenge."

On that note, Alea'sha turns to the others, "I'm not sure what your preference is, but the Felwood is not a safe place by any means. When I came from Winterspring I did so by zeppelin."

Zul'Houngan looks at his companions. "I've never been off of this continent...."

"There will be no zeppelinsssss," Ezra replies, shaking a bony bandaged finger. "We are ssought now. We will be marked, yess. Our departure obsserved. We cannot rissk our mission. You sssaw the ease with which I, a relatively inexperienced magician, made off with the prize. We cannot afford to be sseen, nor tracked."

"Then we have some walking to do, but I'm not sure how you mean to get there without leaving a trail," says Alea'sha. "I know some of my kind have the talent to evade trackers, but I can only manage it for myself."

Ezra nods. "And I can leave no trackss, if I wish. I'm sure our troll friend can make sssimilar..... arrangements." Ezra chuckles. "We will travel to Valormok, the camp in Azzshara. We will asscend the cliff with magic, yes."

Zul'Houngan says simply, "THe spirits will not reveal our secrets...."

"It will have to do," says Alea'sha. "Azshara is not the safest place, either. The naga have claimed much of it, so we will need to stay far from the sea. Still, I wager they wouldn't expect us to go that way."

---

For the first day of travel, the three make their way along the banks of the Southfury River - a watercourse whose headlands start on the very peaks of Mount Hyjal itself, and winds its way between Ashenvale on the west bank and the cliffs of Azshara on the east before passing by Orgrimmar. Alea'sha leads the way, her affinity with nature leaving no trace of her passage, and Ezra accompanies in the form of a cloud of swirling tomb dust, thus leaving no trace in a rather more unnatural way. Alea'sha's friend, and the troll shaman, follow behind.

Though the travelers are relatively unburdened, it isn't possible to reach the lumber camp before sundown. They make camp near the river, the living beings take turns gaining their rest, while Ezra meditates sleeplessly.

The next morning, just as they are preparing to travel once more, Zul'Houngan spots movement in the trees behind them.

Zul'Houngan wanders over to find Alea, and tugs on her sleeve, pointing in the direction of the sound. He does so wordlessly, doing his best to stay as quiet as they have been staying.

As they watch the woods carefully, Zul'Houngan gets another brief glimpse. It is to blurry to distinguish detail, but whatever is there is humanoid, not an animal.

Alea'sha sees where Zul'Houngan is pointing, and notices the sneak. She meets the troll's eyes for a moment, nods just enough to make it clear she understands, and spins to face the enemy, calling upon the power of the wild to hold the barely-seen foe fast.

There is a cry of outrage as the undergrowth springs to life at Alea's command and entwines the creature in vines and tree branches. As it struggles against its bonds, its nature becomes obvious. It is undead - and from the purposefulness of its struggles, it is almost certainly Forsaken.

Zul'Houngan stalks up carefully, even though he sees the action that Alea took, it doesn't feel right. As he's moving, he pilsl out a little glass bead, and throws it inot the air. The bead starts to circle him, sloly at first, and then faster, and faster until his form seems to shimmer a bit blue with the spell's effect.

Suddenly, from the undergrowth nearby, another undead form emerges, wielding a sharp-looking curved sword. It takes a swing at the troll shaman, but in its recklessness the blow goes far wide of its mark.

Meanwhile, his companion, using a similar weapon, begins hacking wildly at the roots that tether him, severing half of them with a single well-placed blow.

The great wolf charges forward to aid Zul'Houngen, leaping and clamping it's jaws on the hip of the forsaken. With a vicious growl it tears away a mouthful of bitter flesh.

Ezra incants a growing favorite spell of his, and a sudden burst of fiery energy strikes out at the surprise attacker. He strides forward with purpose, yelling "Save this one!"

Zul'Houngan calls out, "Someone try and hold him down..." as he moves up to stand near the undead, ready to help someone tackle the thing.

The Forsaken looks at its companion, incinerated almost instantaneously by Ezra's magic, and looks at the three adventurers and their canine companion. It seems to make a decision. Zul'Houngan sees its jaw tense, and hears a crunching sound, and uttering a gargling cry, it collapses to the ground.

A quick examination shows that the Forsaken that was torched by Ezra is burned beyond all recovery. However, the other one, it seems, still has the spark of unlife in it yet.

Zul'Houngan examines the creature's mouth and finds that his rear teeth have been replaced with glass - the shards of it still linger around his rotted tongue. Over the pervasive smell of the animated corpse, Zul'Houngan gets a whiff of a sweeter scent - one he has come to associate with healing potions.

Aside from the teeth, the troll finds that the zombie has a mithril shirt underneath his faded black thin-leather tunic, and bears a fine-looking warblade. It has no other gear, apart from an outdoors outfit and traveling pack - and indeed no identifying marks of any kind.

Ezra scowls. "Wretched thoughtless vermin," he mumbles to himself. Carefully he moves to pull the hints of glass out of the creature's mouth, and inspects the warblade and leather gear as well. He rummages through the pack quickly, throwing things out, finally smashing his fist against the ground.

"Wake him," the mage says finally.

As Alea'sha strips the gear and armor from the undead, she makes a close examination of the thin leather that served as his clothing. Though it's hard to be sure of anything, what with the destruction from the tanning and dyeing process, she's reasonably certain that the leather came from a bovine species of some description; not only that, but that it is of a breed of cattle that was once raised by the cowherds of Tirisfal Glades.

Similar forensic inspection of the rest of the undead's gear reveals similar results. To the extent that anything he wears can be identified at all, its origin is from the northlands of Lordaeron, where the Forsaken battle for their lives against the Scourge.

"This one has come a long way from home," says Alea'sha quietly. She runs a finger gingerly along the battered leather, "This material comes from Tirisfal Glades." She lets out a sigh and concentrates, binding the negative energies of nature to her will and forcing them into the still form of the prisoner. "Your time is not up yet," she whispers.

The creature's eyelids flutter open, revealing clouded white eyes that roll in their sockets. It struggles against its bonds for a moment, fruitlessly, then slumps, glaring wordlessly at its captors.

Ezra backhands the Forsaken with a bony hand. "IDIOT!" he shouts. "You useless stinking worthless foul degenerate! You waste of rotting flesh!" Fetid breath bellows forth from his mouth. "What were you thinking?"

The eyes flick to Ezra with a gaze of pure hatred, but it does not respond. Its jaws work, as if it were trying to crush the teeth a second time, before realizing that that gambit has already failed, and settles for returning Ezra's gaze wordlessly.

Alea'sha frowns at the dangling forsaken. "If it doesn't want to cooperate, we could just chop off the limbs, stuff it in a box, and return it to Ogrimmar. I'm certain that the orcs would love to experiment with interrogation techniques. And since it seems it can just keep coming back.. it could last a very long time."

The creature's eyes widen, and then narrow. "I won't tell them anything either!" it declares. "Our great work must not be hampered!" It pauses, and then sets its jaw again. Inasmuch as it manages to have any expression, it looks embarrassed.

"Is that the Dark Lady's work... or just your own?" Ezra asks. But he says no more, interested in what Alea'sha has to say, and wanting to read the captive.

"So you do know something," says Alea'sha, smirking. "You aren't very good at this. If we send you back to Ogrimmar, you won't last a day." She looks around slowly, "But maybe that won't be necessary." She says to Zul'Houngan, "Could you help me for a moment? We need to gather some tinder and kindling. Our new friend knows something, and I'm not nearly as patient as the orcs."

"Go ahead..." says the creature, smiling. "I haven't been warm in years."

Ezra shakes his head, holding back Alea'sha. "This is not the way," he whispers.

Zul'Houngan looks up. He almsot can't stand to see the thing like that. He shakes his head, "I wonder what it wants out of life..."

Alea'sha looks at the forsaken and crosses her arms, "Very well. Do it your way. I just hope we get something out of it before the end."

Ezra shakes his head again. "Fire, dismemberment, none of this will make any difference. We..." He turns, now to regard the prisoner. "You, and I. Slaves of the Scourge, weren't we. You remember. You died. You rose again. Perhaps it was your family that you killed and ate. Maybe just strangers. Trapped, yes? Trapped behind that wall of mindless barbarity. I wonder, hmm, how long you would retain yourself. We could bury you, perhaps, yesss.."

The creature stares at Ezra, pop-eyed. "N-never! No matter what you do to me - I won't betray my mistress!"

"Ahh, yes," says Alea'sha, immediately perking as if delighted by the prospect. "Now that is a deliciously horrible idea." She pays no attention to the dangling forsaken, making it clear that she's caught-up in the pleasure of destroying the enemy. "Your mistress?" The druid pauses, "No, no matter. I suppose it is best that we just get on with it, yes? We can't have him digging out somehow, so the limbs will have to come off first, of course. Less to bury that way, anyhow, isn't there?" She nearly bubbles with amusement, "I must give you credit, it is a stroke of genius. I suppose after he loses his mind we can rattle out the rest of the details. In the end, it will be easier to coax those visions out of a thoughtless husk than a stubborn puppet."

The creature trembles in reaction - some mixture of fear and impotent rage on its face - but it says nothing.

The mage chuckles. "You've betrayed your mistress already, yess. You failed. We live. And while you rot twenty feet underground, we'll be on our way and you'll have lossst us. But.... there is another way. You can do your duty, yesss. You'd like that, wouldn't you?" His reedy voice takes on a wheedling, friendly air. "Choossse now.. while you are above the ground."

The undead utters a screech of wild rage as it addresses Ezra. "My duty will be done when your companions are dead and _you_ have been delievered into my Mistress' claws- ...hands!" it sputters.

"Oh ho!" Ezra crows. "Lady Ssatha fell before us. Lady Val'jara was tricked by us. We've led those sorceresses on a merry chase. You think that your matron sea-witch is any better, hmm? Let us ssseee."

The creature tries to conceal its reaction, but Ezra has an almost uncanny ability to read people. And he can see the panic and guilt in its face for a brief moment. It has indeed revealed too much.

"Yesss, my friends, even the will of the Forsaken can fall to the naga's power." Ezra gleefully rubs his bandaged hands together, staring at the captive with burning eyes. "Sso. You wish the chalice returned. The naga will .. what? Wipe out the living races from the ssurface? Render the world fit only for the Forsaken, while they own the ssea? Hmm? Is that what you were promised?"

The creature glares at Ezra. The mask is in place again. But there is an air of defeat about its posture that wasn't there before.

Ezra shakes his head. "And the Ssscourge. What of them, hmm? What will you do about the Scourge? Fool."

The zombie shakes his head. "You don't understand..." it says, glancing at Alea'sha and Zul'Houngan.

"Alea'sha. Zul'Houngan." Ezra's voice has resumed its normal timber. "Go. Go far."

As the two disappear into the distance, the mage stares back at the lone captive. "You mean _they_ don't understand," he says quietly.

Now two Forsaken talk, alone, about the concerns that only the former thralls of the Lich King share. "We are not strong enough," hisses the would-be assassin. "Even with the help of the blood elves, the Scourge threatens to overwhelm us. We need allies!" It stares at Ezra. "And why do you strive to aid the living?" That last word is spoken with vicious contempt.

Ezra cocks his head. "You ssay we need alliesss, then assk why I haven't yet betrayed those who have spilled blood for me? You fool. The Horde is not a mount to be ridden. It is a comrade in armss." He leans closer. "You have sseen the effects of the chaliccce? How is that better than enslavement by the Lich-King, hmm?"

The creature seems unmoved by most of Ezra's speech, but when the mage speaks of the chalice, it seems... almost startled. "What are you talking about?" It tries to come off as a challenge, but there is too much uncertainty in its tone.

"Oh ho, secrets have been kept from you, yesss. Buried in the grave of ignorance already.." Ezra smiles through his bandages, eyeing the captive curiously. "How could this be, among 'allies'?" He lets this linger, then explains. "Tiragarde Keep. Lady Ssatha used a magical chalice to enssslave the human population there. Drinking from it turned them into will-less sslaves, yes. We captured it. And then this..." Ezra unfolds his copy of Daniel Bates' missive and holds it up for inspection.

The creature's eyes flick through the letter. "I know about _this_," he says. "This is why we were sent after you..." It shakes its head. "This doesn't matter! The living deserve no better than slavery!"

"The living deserve our suffering, yess. Is that it?" Ezra asks.

The assassin looks back at Ezra. "I..." it begins, hesitantly, then strengthens its resolve. "Yes! Yes, and why not?"

"Because we didn't deserve it either," the mage whispers, hanging his head. He grasps the warblade. "Your camp iss in Azshara, I assume."

The captive Forsaken eyes the warblade, but says nothing.

"Well then. I can help you finissh your duty. I can put your hunger to resst. Is that what you wish?" Ezra asks quietly.

"What do you intend?" it asks, equally quietly. "Surely you don't intend to turn yourself in?"

"Nooo. But I can spare you the shame of failure," Ezra says, hefting the warblade. "Or we will see... what the Dark Lady thinks of your... scheme, yesss. None of this nonsense about the orcs. They do not know us."

"I... could not face the Lady," it says, hanging its head. "Not now."

"We will ssseee that you do not," Ezra whispers.

---

Ezra returns to his comrades, the warblade slung over his shoulder. "It sseems wisest that we bury him after all, yesss."

The mage's face is composed. His radiant eyes do not glow overmuch. He has the slouch common to all of the Forsaken, but he lacks the manic energy he sometimes possesses. "I believe they have a camp in Azsshara. Nearest coastline, unless I am much mistaken."

"So I guess he wasn't able to select a wiser path," says Alea'sha softly. She sounds disappointed, but not surprised. "Let's finish here and move on. Unless you wish to attack the camp, of course. I think it might be wiser to deal with that later."
