# Turning Tides 2008-05-24

Zul'Houngan rushes along jungle paths, rapidly growing short of breath. Behind him, he can hear the angry, gurgling voices of hundreds of murlocs. As he rounds a corner, he emerges into a clearing - or rather, an old ruin. Stone slabs ring under his bare feet, and old troll-carved pillars rise around him. And distributed around what used to be a room - or perhaps a temple - is a ten-foot-tall statue of a troll.

There are five statues in all, and he can see a clear resemblance in their faces and in their tribal tattoos, etched into the stone of their faces and chests. Not only are they all Darkspears, but they are all related - indeed, they are all related to _him_. As he looks up at them, one of them turns to face him, and hisses: "Zul'Houngan of the Darkspears. You not be ready."

Zul'Houngan looks up into the face of his familiar, or, at least more familiar ancestors. "I have got so far, O honorable ones." He pants, looking around in a wind daze.

"Not far enough. You not ready to face the Old Ones," says another statue, stepping off its pedestal. A third emerges from its stony slumber: "Look at you. Look how you flee. Look how you run from Its mere minions. How can ya hope ta stand against the God Itself?"

Zul wildly looks around, in his dazed state, he can but nod. They be the ancestors, after all. Not much you can tell 'em they don't already knows, non?

As a fourth statue strides forward, preparing to address the young troll again, the murlocs swarm into the ruins, surrounding Zul'Houngan on all sides, aiming their spears at him. As one, almost indifferently, the six stone trolls raise their hands. And suddenly the jungle around them comes alive. Vines writhe from between the old paving stones and bind the murlocs in their iron grip. Swarms of flies and mosquitoes bedevil them, and scorpions and snakes crawl over their bodies. In mere minutes, the ruins are clear, and the voices of the murlocs are silenced.

Zul'Houngan sits down in the ruins. He pulls out his rattles, shaking them over his knees as he concentrates on the scene before him. He mombles words low in his throat, barely audable.

The largest of the statues reaches out with its stony arm and grasps Zul'Houngan by the shoulder. "De zombies and de elves cannot teach ye what ye need ta know- not e'en the one wi' the wolf. Ye must train wit yer own kind. Dey have secrets ye need to learn. Wake up, Zul'Houngan. Wake up!" He shakes the troll violently by the shoulder, and as he does so, his gravelly voice changes, becomes that of Alea'sha who is shaking him awake.

The morning sun shines on the side of the cliff, where the party had camped partway up. The faded glory of Azshara sprawls below them, an unfathomable distance below, and the snow-covered tips of the Hyjal foothills stretch above.

Sweat streaks off of Zul's brow after he starts awake from his trance. The mists of this spell hang in the air. He stares ahead for a moment, careful to rest his mind into the lessons just learned, lest they escape, as he was always taught. He turns to Alea. "I must return." He says, simply.

"Yes, return to the land of the waking. You were raving in your sleep," says the druid softly. "Are you feeling alright?" Bad illnesses are hardly something to be taken lightly at this point.

Zul'Houngan shakes his head, and looks around. "De spirits. Dey tell me I'm on the wrong path." He looks around. These are his friends, after all, "So, I think my path maybe not follow yours much longer, non?" He says, sighing sadly. He looks at the things spread before him.

"Not follow ours much longer?" asks Alea'sha. "What did they tell you? Are you sure it was the spirits and not something else?"

Zul'Houngan shrugs, "De message was very clear." He says. It seems he's not too comfortable talking about it in detail. He nods. "It was defiantly them. It was.. my ancestors. More of them then I've ever seen around before."

Alea'sha frowns in thought. She doesn't like what she is saying by any means, but she will not hide from it. "If you are sure, and you believe what they have said.. You must do what you think is best, of course."

Zul'Houngan nods. "Besides. If I abandon my ancestors; they might abandon me. In any case, I will need to talk to my kin when we get up the cliff."

Saeren has remained silent throughout this. For that matter, she has been silent most of the climb, except when she's had occasion to deliver a sharp order for silence or greater care with the ascent.

The wizard has little to add. The troll has a spiritual journey to undertake. Ezra's idea of 'the sacred ancestors' is closer to crumbling bones lying in forgotten graves under gray skies than voices in one's dreams providing wisdom. The Forsaken's ancestors have little knowledge to contribute beyond the implacable power of mortality. Still, there's wisdom of a sort to be found there - everything has an end.

Through various means, the party is able to defy gravity. Ezra, with his magics, imbues his comrades with the spell of flight. He follows the others as a whirling vaporous cloud of dust. Below them, Azshara's spectral, haunted forests and rolling hills lie like a gateway to untrodden worlds of mystery. Beyond is the everpresent Great Sea, and the sound of its waves crashing mercilessly against age-worn rocks fades into silence as the group ascends.

Past rocky outcroppings, past impossibly high streams of near-frozen waterfalls, past the roughly-hewn walls of the foreboding cliff face, past bird's nests, past unhealthy-looking growths of moss and fungus. Through the cloud cover, up through the chilling winds that force everyone to draw their cloaks and coats tightly around them. Up until they break through the lowest layer of churning clouds and see the icicles clinging to the edges of the torrential waterfalls. The snow-line is a stark white boundary, daring the adventurers to cross over it and into the inhospitable roof of the world.

As the adventurers make their way over the precipice, they find themselves looking out over still more frozen landscape. Snow-covered pine woods stretch off in all directions, except to the south, where the treeline drops off into a gorge, deep by any measure except by comparison to the cliffs which they have just scaled. Off to the southwest, dim red smoke floats upward - Alea'sha quickly recognizes this as the fumes of Darkwhisper Gorge, a lair of demons left behind by the Third War, still struggling to gain the summit of Mount Hyjal where their leader Archimonde met his end. Though the landscape is largely devoid of landmarks save the demonic smoke, more subtle reference points are evident to Alea'sha's eye. This is where she was trained in the ways of druidism.

"Our first order of business is fortunately on the way to Everlook, which I think some of us might fancy more than time with the Blue Dragonflight." Alea'sha wouldn't be one of those. Since her first time in a city her view has improved slightly, but she's hardly eager to spend more time in one.

Ezra, having re-adopted his human (or at least bipedal) shape, stomps the end of his cane into the permafrost of the Winterspring landscape. "I'll go wherever I'm welcomed," he says with a sardonic smile.

Zul'Houngan is still in a slight daze from his vision this morning, and is more or less following on autopilot.

"It's not a hard march," says Saeren. It's the most she's said at once in several hours. "But we'd best not let our guard down just because it's chilly here."

"Yes, chilly..." Ezra casts an eye at the night elf. "I'd noticced, yess."

The forest is not silent. Over the hills can be heard the cries of wildkin, a strange half-bear half-owl hybrid that populates these lands - Alea'sha's tutor taught her that they are particularly beloved of the moon goddess Elune, though dangerous to confront. As well, there are the howls of wolves, to which Alea'sha's friend perks up his ears but does not respond. Once, they sight a blue-scaled chimera slowly soaring over the snowpack, but it apparently has business elsewhere which does not include the party.

It is not long before they reach the road, but several hours later before they reach the half-disguised path that leads off into the west. They hardly travel long at all before they are confronted with two large dragonspawn, blue-scaled creatures with dragon torsos and sturdy bipedal lower halves, accompanied by a young dragon whelp which hovers on its foot-long wings. "Halt!" calls one of the dragonspawn in Common. "This land is off limits to travelers!"

"I am a traveler, but I am not a strange to these lands," says Alea'sha. She steps forward with her great wolf at her side. "I am here in the service of your dragonflight. We have brought with us an artifact of great power. It is a danger to all the free races and there are none more qualified to deal with it than the dragons here."

"A likely story," grunts one of the dragonspawn, looking skeptical. "Why should we allow you into Mazthoril?"

"Because time is short, and you know that my small party is no danger itself," replies Alea'sha. "Surely I have not been utterly forgotten in such a short time. Alea'sha is my name, and I do not believe I have met you before."

Even as the dragonspawn speaks, however, the dragon whelp seems to be studying Alea'sha closely. When she gives her name, it calls, "Wait here - I'll check on this," in Draconic, then flies off into the distance.

The dragonspawn raises its hand as if to delay, but the blue dragon has already departed, and it has little to do but watch the party. They do not wait long. The whelp soon returns, accompanied by a much larger drake. "Alea'sha, is it? Welcome, foundling," it says, its vivid azure eyes seeming to smile in amusement. "Come this way, please."

The dragonspawn's skepticism remains, but it is overridden by the blue drake's orders. The party is led into a system of caves that lead deep into the side of Mount Hyjal, and are left before a high elf sitting in the lotus position, wearing elegant robes of many colors - if a rainbow could exist in nothing but blue, this one's robes would embody such a rainbow. It looks up at Alea'sha, and she notices that the pupils of its own blue eyes are slitted. "Ah, the foundling. You have done well for yourself, I see. Tell me more about this tale of a powerful artifact."

Alea'sha bows politely, knowing well who she is addressing. "We have managed to survive, at least," says the druid. "But we have found something far from pleasant. We have come upon evidence that makes it clear that one of the olds ones has awoken. The murlocs are waking now, led by naga from the waters to attack and enslave men." She looks to Ezra for a moment, then back, "If you will look after it, we will call to us a chalice that is used to enslave men, to bind them to the sea."

"The Old Ones, you say?" says the elf, his brow furrowing. "This is not an idle matter. Those beings are old and evil beyond imagining. And you say that one of them is returning?" It pauses. "Murlocs? What are these murlocs?"

"They are abominations of the sea," says Alea'sha. "They plague many shorelines, but now they are more active. We believe that the old one is driving them on, and that they may be trying to drag the whole world under the waves with them, or at the very least gain mastery of all living people."

"Fish-creatures?" the elf asks, his eyes widening. As this is confirmed, he seems to grow angry. "Mur'gul!" spits the elf, rising to his feet. "The servants of the Ravenous One! They dare come onto the land again?" His blue eyes seem to glow - and his robe billows out around him, turns into scaled wings, and his pale skin becomes blue with scales as he mounts into the air. The dragon - for such he is - looks at Alea'sha and growls with a deep voice. "We will accept this artifact of the cursed Mur'gul. Call for your allies to bring it here."

Alea'sha turns to Ezra. "Call them. I think we are about to learn more about the enemy than will be good for our rest." Knowledge is power, but it rarely leads to pleasant dreams.

Ezra withdraws the arcane tool from the pocket of his coat. He sets it down, muttering a few phrases under his breath and activating it. "There, they will sense it and come, yesss. But... we were ambussshed before. Best to be cautiouss of who arrives." And so saying, he readies his cane.

Several seconds pass, as the tablet glows softly. And then there is a shimmering in the air, arcane energy glittering above the tablet, and an orc emerges, clad in crimson robes and carrying a familiar-looking lead-lined box. "Thrall sends his regards," says the orc, proffering the chest to the dragon.

The dragon reaches down and delicately takes the box between two claws, levering it open with a talon. He hisses at the gleaming golden cup resting inside. "It reeks of the Old Ones," says the creature. "You have done well to bring this to our attention." It looks to the south, toward Darkwhisper Gorge. "As if the remnants of the Legion and the spawn of Deathwing did not occupy enough of that attention already..."

"We do not expect you to fight for usss," says Ezra. "But any wissdom you can share about these matterss will be of inesstimable value, yes."

The dragon shakes its ponderous head. "There is so much lore to share. It would be the telling of many weeks, and we must send word to Coldarra, for only the eldest among us remember that War. And we have need of messengers to spread the word amongst the civilized races."

"I intend to be such a messenger," answers the mage. He gestures at the others. "As you can ssee, the Horde has already been warned. We must still travel far." He gestures then at Saeren specifically. "Thiss one, I hope, will allow me to approach Darnassusss and live. The Alliance musst also be told."

"Then who among you will listen to our tales?" asks the dragon. The orc mage, for his part, shakes his head. "I am needed by Orgrimmar," he says. "Although I will happily carry back any messages you have for Thrall."

Ezra turns to the orc. "There are Forssaken who ally with the naga," he says, "but the Undercity has not betrayed the Horde. They are few, and they still fear Sylvanass. I will sseek to uncover this plot."

"I will listen," says Alea'sha quietly. "It will take time, of course, but we need to understand the truth. We need to know how to fight, so you will not have to fight for us. It is again time for us to stand on our own."

The dragon nods. "It will be good to have your return, Alea'sha," he says. "We have much to teach you beyond the ways of our ancient enemy." He looks upon the others. "We had wondered why the naga had begun to prey upon our people in the lands of Azshara. Now we can guess that they were preparing to make their move."

Alea'sha is quiet now, contemplating this turn of events in silence. It seems she, too, is leaving her friends behind. At least for a time.

Ezra steps forward. "There is something unrelated, yess. The naga were in possession of a.. vest.. woven from dragonscales. Blue scales. We wissh to return this thing to you. It would be of great value to us, but so would any other such vest, perhapsss of a .....different color."

The dragon sighs as it looks down upon the Forsaken mage. "That is... just like the naga," it says with quiet anger and sadness. Its eyes glint slightly. "And just like a Forsaken, too, to bargain at a time like this." It does not seem offended, though. "Yes, we will reward you for avenging the loss of our kin. And... I agree. A similar trophy, taken from the hides of _our_ hated enemies, seems a fitting reward. It will take a few days to have it made, though. Will you be staying in Everlook?"

Ezra smiles lopsidedly. "We must have any advantage we can get," he whispers to himself. Aloud, then: "Yes. We musst be on our business. The naga musst be stopped. Our world has enough enemiess, yess."

"Of many kinds," speaks up the orc mage. "I will bring word of the Forsaken betrayers to Thrall. He will know how to investigate the matter. I'll be honest - I don't trust _any_ of your people," he says, nodding to Ezra, "but I've gotta admit, you've helped us out. Maybe you aren't all bad." He bows deeply to the dragon. "Pleased to meet you, sir." And with that, he begins gesturing his spell of departure.

As Saeren, Ezra, and Zul'Houngan pass through the gear-toothed gates of Everlook, the troll shaman's eye is drawn to a troll wearing a voodoo mask. It is facing away from the party, apparently discussing something with a goblin, but looks up abruptly, as if hearing something, and turns toward them. "You! You are Zul'Houngan, yes?" it hisses, and to Zul'Houngan's surprise, the voice is female.

Zul'Houngan blinks and turns to the woman. "I am he of who you speak." He blinks. "What be you doing here? What business do I have wit you?" He asks her, as it probably isn't her place to be out like this.

The lips can be seen to smile beneath the mask that covers the upper half of the troll woman's face. "I be known as Mau'ari. I come to study the spirits of animals, but me ancestors speak to me in my dreams and they tell me, a young troll needs to be taught our ways. They give me your name, and here you are!"

Zul'Houngan turns to Ezra. "Apperantly this is what my ancestors were telling me." He blinks and looks at the woman, skeptically. "At least, that's what it seems to be." He bows to Ezra, "I believe this is where our paths shall split. Fare you well on your journey."

"Be seein' ya," is the best translation of Ezra's reedy-voiced Zandali. "Find what you seek."

Saeren, who barely knows any of these strangers with whom she is parting company, offers a curt nod, which is perhaps as polite as she can manage. "Stay alive."

The Forsaken's next order of business is to figure out how to get out of Everlook. And of course, he needs somewhere to go. He's already thought this over, ever since the appearance of the night elf. "Ssaeren," he says, "if the murlocs are appearing everywhere, the naga will as well, I think. We mussst warn the Alliance. How welcome are you in your peoples' landss?"

"Welcome enough," says Saeren. "But not so welcome that they will greet you like a long lost son." She laughs grimly, obviously finding a bit of humor in this. "But it can be managed, of course."

Ezra nods. "Then I ssuggest we make our way to elven lands. I do not expect you to fight for my life. Simply vouch for our mission, and I will be well content, yess. Will you do thiss?"

"We will kill murlocs and naga," replies Saeren. To her, that is answer enough. "Of course, you must understand something. My people must be shown. They will mark it quite convenient that one who travels with me urges them to fight those creatures."

"There are wayss of convincing them, yes," Ezra mutters.

---

Though the Forsaken and night elf take a room at one of Winterspring's inns, they are not greatly inclined to spend much time in the common room. Which is why they are somewhat surprised to be greeted by a goblin as they are talking with the innkeeper.

Nerai waves, looking up at the other two traveling companions. She looks around, her eyes throughout the entire time darting to the good. Her spindly fingers tap against her studded leather apron, grease and tools carried with her even now. "Travelers, yes?" She asks, simply. Obviously the little one is scared of.. something.

Ezra nods. "Yess, we are. How can we be of sservice?"

Nerai blinks. Well, they responded. She regains a bit of her composure. "I am .. Neari." She pauses. "I was hoping I could be of service to you.." She begins in, "That is, if you are traveling a ways away..." She reveals a bit more, then maybe she should to complete strangers, but, who's going to care...

"We will probably travel mosst of the world. Darnassus, and the Easstern Kingdoms after that," says Ezra. "Our bussiness is dangerous."

"Hmph," is Saeren's encouraging reply. "More of this coincidental meeting business it seems." She looks to Ezra. It's his party, as it were. If two is a party, anyway.

Nerai juts out her chin in a way not exactly goblinish, and nods, "I am no stranger to danger, and do not fear it." She nods. "And I find that little in this world is truly a coincidence."

"Well then..." Ezra taps his bandaged chin. "We wissh to leave Everlook. You do as well, pressumably with uss.. If you can be useful to us, we will be usseful to you, yes."

Nerai bows to Ezra. And then turn, offering another bow to the mostly slient night elf. "I am in your debt." She nods. There's too much on Nerai's mind to ask after what Ezra is actually doing. But uncertain dangers are always less fearful then certain ones, yes?
