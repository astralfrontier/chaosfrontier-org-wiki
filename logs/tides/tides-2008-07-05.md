# Turning Tides 2008-07-05

As Gribniz and Whizzle work on unloading the airship, the rest of the adventurers step out, to be greeted by a burly orc. His eyes move over the group, and then widen as they come to rest on the night elf. "We weren't expecting the Sentinel emissary to come by airship," he says, gruffly. "What is this?"

"Life is fluid, change is inevitable," answers Saeren. "We're lucky we're here at all." She meets the eyes of the orc evenly.

"Fine," says the orc. "Come this way, then. We have much to discuss." He turns to the others. "We'll talk to you later. Right now we have a crisis, and we must talk to this sentinel right now." He strides off, looking over his shoulder at Saeren and clearly expecting her to follow.

Saeren follows. "A crisis." She doesn't much care for the sound of that. Her usual solution to problems rarely works in a crisis.

The orc leads Saeren into a small hut, with two bodyguards on either side of an orc of clear importance, who stands and bows when Saeren enters. "Welcome, night elf," he says, clearly under some strain. "Your kind have harassed our lumber camp at Warsong for some time, and we accept that as the fortunes of war - but this we cannot ignore. We require Gorthak's safe return at once."

Saeren returns the bow as much as she can manage. "Ah, so my people have got their hands on someone important, have they?" She sounds more annoyed than pleased. "Overseer Gorthak, no less." She frowns in thought, "Well, the odds are rather long that they will hand them over at my word alone. Do you have something or someone to trade? Naturally it would not be a matter for others to know. It would be rather embarassing."

"Do not play games with me," says the orc. "Do you have the authority to negotiate on the Sentinels' behalf or not?" Just then, an orc appears at the door. "Sir, the Sentinels' emissary is... huh?" he begins, as his eyes fall on the night elf already in the hut. Following behind him with fluid grace, another night elf appears in the doorway. "So, Mastok..." she begins, addressing the orc behind the table, and then her voice trails off. "Saeren? What are you doing here?" she asks, perplexed as well as annoyed.

"I'm just lucky, I guess," says Saeren. "But it is your fortune that I bring, not my own. I am here on the brink of war with an enemy that we have discounted as of late."

"Funny you should mention that," says Luciel Starwhisper. She turns to the orc again. "Your belligerent demand is misplaced, Mastok. Though we would much like to have been responsible for your precious overseer's abduction, we were not. My sentinels reported that a naga was seen leaving your accursed lumber camp, with a bound orc in tow. I suggest you take up your dispute with them."

Mastok glares at Luciel. "So you were spying on us," he begins, to which Luciel simply shrugs indifferently. "If your sentinels saw their departure, they would know which way they went-" This draws a laugh from the haughty elf. "And you wish our assistance in his recovery? Perhaps you'd like us to track him down and capture him for ourselves? This is our best opportunity to do so, after all. And _then_ we can negotiate for his release..."

"This stupidity is no longer excusable," says Saeren. "I will find him and bring him back to his people. Any who will kill Naga are my friends, and they will be the best company in the war that is coming. As for those who are locked into ancient squabbles to the benefit of our enemies.. they can stand around talking. It is all they have ever been good for."

Luciel whirls to face her fellow elf. "Have you gone insane in your desire for vengeance? You would help the... the bespoilers in their quest to denude the sacred Ashenvale Forest?" Mastok merely sits down, watching the two with a bemused expression.

"THINK!" roars Saeren. "The Overseer of our enemy is taken right on our borders by the Naga." She is tired of this nonsense. "A bit unusual behavior, wouldn't you say? Naga aren't mindless. They know rank, they understand our world far better than we grasp their's. They wanted this. They want a fullblown war. While we kill each other they will finish their preparations. Our strength spent on a worthy foe, we will be easily picked off and completely blind to the danger under the waves."

Luciel leans back, turning pale in shock at Saeren's tirade. "Then what do you suggest we do, Finblighter?" she hisses. "Go charging in to the rescue of this orc, so that the trees of Ashenvale can continue to die?"

"It wouldn't be a bad start," replies Saeren. "A sign of goodwill that might just lead to something beyond endless, pointless conflict. The orcs are already paying attention to this enemy. The humans have tasted its power. An Old God has awoken. It has the strength to turn our own people into its slaves. One of the chalices it used to do so is now guarded and studied by the Blue Dragonflight. They take the threat seriously. Of all people our own should have a sense of obligation to keep this enemy in check as well. Your scouts must already know the Naga of Azshara are moving in greater numbers. Doesn't anyone wonder why?"

Lucien seems uncertain, but rallies. "What nonsense is this? You _have_ gone mad in your rage against the naga, Finblighter. You and your mad tales of... of _chalices_ and plots. We have kept the naga in check for ten thousand years - we have their measure. Help your precious orcs, if you wish. You will have no help from us." Luciel whirls and stalks out of the orcish hut.

Mastok is silent for a moment, then speaks. "Saeren Finblighter. Are you the hunter they tell of in Valormok? The one who strikes at the naga unseen in the wilds of Azshara?"

Just as Luciel leaves Saeren murmurs, "About time. I thought she'd never get out of here." The elf turns to Mastok, "I am. Take me to where your Overseer was taken. If the Naga are the culprits, I will hunt them and take him back. If the elf was lying I will take him from the Night Elves."

The orc looks surprised. "You would fight even your own people? You _are_ a strange one, Saeren." He shakes his head. "But I do not think Luciel was lying. You... I mean, the Sentinels are deadly foes, but they have been honorable. If she says that her people did not take Gorthak, then they did not." He stands again. "My men will lead you to the lumber camp. May your blades never dull."

"Thank you," says Saeren. "Strange is perhaps the nicest thing I have been called of late. I will get your man back alive. The naga, however, will not be so fortunate."

---

The ground around Gorthak's large hut is mostly undisturbed. However, Saeren's skilled eye soon finds bare orc footprints, an assortment of webbed prints, and the semicircular depression she recognizes as the trail of a naga. They have departed to the northwest.

"She wasn't lying," says Saeren quietly. She tests her bowstring and smiles darkly. "Time to go hunting."

Several hours later, Saeren's keen ears pick up a disturbance. Off to the north in the direction of the trail she follows, she can hear splashing, and a brief burst of orcish cursing.

As Saeren creeps through the woods, she can hear the splashing continue, and the orcish cursing occasionally cutting off, to be replaced by a gurgling sound, before continuing. As she reaches the edge of a roadway, her quarry comes into sight.

An orc is submerged to shoulder-height in the lake, surrounded by a naga and two spindly-looking murlocs. The fishmen and naga seem to be trying to dunk the orc under the lake, but even though the orc is not using his hands, he seems to be having some success in wriggling out of their grasp. Still, it seems that it's only a matter of time before they succeed at what they're doing.

As the murlocs struggle with their captive, a flaming arrow plunges, hissing, into the lake. The three aquatics react immediately, releasing the orc and whirling in all directions, trying to see where the attack came from.

Saeren smirks as the first shot misses but serves its purpose nonetheless. A few steps farther and she fires once again. This time her blast tears into the flesh of the naga, searing the hated creature with fire. The night elf disappears into cover once more, seeking to further abuse her enemies.

A second hit strikes the naga - but this time, Saeren is seen. One of the murlocs utters its trademark gargling cry and runs full-tilt toward the disturbance, hampered by its webbed feet.

Seeing an enemy charging makes Saeren switch targets. "I don't think so, little fish," she whispers. Her bow sings once, and in a burst of fire the murloc tumbles down, gurgling its last breath away.

The naga, observing what happened to one of her retainers, moves more cautiously. She slithers out of the water and crouches behind a large boulder, pulling out a bow of her own.

The surviving murloc follows his mistress' lead, splashing out of the lake to lurk behind the same boulder and drawing a spear from behind his back.

The next exchange is little to the liking of either archer, as both pollute the woods with spent arrows. The night elf looks thoughtful, then decides it's time to welcome her other enemy.

The murloc decides that he isn't close enough to hit the offending archer, and so rushes forward to take cover behind a nearer tree. Meanwhile... the orc, spotting his chance, charges at the naga, earning a faceful of sharp claws for his trouble but successfully pushing the snake-woman out from behind the rock.

Saeren arches her eyebrows, noticing at the last moment that the orc is doing more than just hiding. "He has guts," she whispers. The arrow takes to the wind and rams deep into the stomach of the Naga, erupting in fire. Seeing another enemy dead she takes her measure of her remaining foe.

Alone and desperate, the murloc abandons his cover and runs toward his enemy, throwing a spear that goes far wide of the mark. The orc grins savagely at his fallen foe and then slumps onto the boulder.

Saeren shakes her head, losing track of the spear as it flies past. Her shot is not distracted, though it doesn't do great harm, just barely breaking the flesh and leaving a small burn.

The second shot delivers a blow just solid enough to bring the murloc down. "If only it were always so simple." Saeren rushes forward, hoping that the Overseer isn't badly hurt.

When Saeren draws near to the Orc she calls out, "Overseer Gorthak, are you hurt? Mastok sent me to find you." Hopefully he will understand in short order that she's not an enemy.

Gorthak looks up at Saeren. "So... out of one enemy's hands and into the hands of another-" he wheezes. "M-mastok sent you? How strange." He coughs. "Need... need a shaman, though. Fed me... some kind of foul brew... and her claws... poisoned...."

A quick search of the corpses of the fallen reveals little of interest on the murlocs, but a high-quality leather jacket on the naga... as well as a heavy wooden box, carved with Nazja runes. "There's some kind of cup in there," Gorthak supplies. "Made me... drink from it..."

"They've cursed you. Can you walk?" asks Saeren. "We'll have to get you out of here before it takes hold." She thinks quickly, trying to estimate how much time she has. Poisoned on top of it. "I hate Naga."

Saeren stops by the lake to wash out the claw wounds given to him by the naga, then treat them with herbs she finds nearby. "Much better," says the orc. "It doesn't sting anymore." He is still weak from his ordeal, but 'weak' for an orc commander is still more than hearty enough for him to travel safely back to the lumber camp.

---

Kagarn finishes his prayer to the spirits. "We caught it before it could take hold," he says to Gorthak. "A foul disease it was, though - I could feel the strength of it." Behind him, an orcish locksmith has finished opening the box Saeren recovered. The golden cup inside, nestled in the lead lining, looks smaller than the one Ezra told about, but the Nazja runes are very similar.

"Damn," says Saeren quietly. The sight of the cup clearly has her dismayed. "It is as I feared. They can make more of them." She says to the Shaman, "It is a dark curse, and I fear you have not seen the last of it. Unless everyone is vigilant this curse will be used against everyone who lives near the shores. And even some who are not." She looks to Overseer, "I wonder what they were hoping to achieve. To use you for information or to use you to start a war with this little trick to add to their ranks?"

Gorthak shrugs. "Both, I think," he says. "They didn't tell me what they had in mind, but from what you've told me about this curse, I'd have told them anything they wanted to know, _and_ I'd have been able to return to my people and lead them astray. All I'd have to do is come up with some tale of heroic escape and keep the gills hidden."

"A pity we couldn't benefit from it. I'm afraid their dead will make it all too clear that they didn't succeed," says Saeren. "You are free of them, and alive. That is enough. This prevents wasteful conflict when the real enemy is waiting." She looks to the chalice. "I'd like to use that to make a point." She narrows her eyes, "I want to shove it right up Luciel's... " The elf trails off into silence, leaving very little to the imagination.

The orc grins toothily. "I like the way you think, elf."

---

"The Sentinel emissary returns," declares the orc messenger. Luciel stalks in with another elf in tow, glaring first at Saeren and then at Gorthak. "The messenger said you had something to show us," she says gruffly. The newcomer, whose cloak's brooch bears the emblem of the Cenarion Circle, strides smoothly across the room and reaches for the golden cup... then draws her hand back as if burned. "Evil," she hisses. "I can feel the taint on this thing, even from here."

The druid draws a waterskin from her belt and pours it into the cup; the water is clear when it is poured in, but bubbles up as a foul greenish brew. The druid half-closes her eyes as she gestures over the cup, her hand glowing a faint blue... and then she nods. "It is diseased," she says. She pours the cup's contents back into the waterskin, and daubs red paint in a warning symbol on the side. "I will need to study this further, but there can be no doubt that it bears some taint." She smiles faintly. "If it is any comfort, the taint is lessened in the cup itself now. I think its magic needs some time to build up again after being used."

Luciel looks uncomfortable, perhaps even embarrassed. "A... a tainted cup," she mutters, glancing at Saeren. Her subdued tone is a far cry from the arrogance she held before. "You... you spoke of a chalice, did you not? Is this... is this what you spoke of?"

"Unfortunately they have many of them," says Saeren. "If a single naga of no great power has one without so much as a decent guard then they are clearly worth very little to our enemy. If that is the case, they must be easy to make." Now that she's made her point, she does not care to point out the earlier debate.

Luciel rubs her chin. "This does not change the fact that your logging in this wood is unacceptable," she says to Gorthak. "We cannot agree to work with you. But I will say this: our attention will be focused eastward now."

"How about a deal be struck then," says Saeren. "As far as I know, our enemy's greatest strength is in Azshara. If not for the Naga, I think Azshara would be a suitable place for a logging expedition. Far better than, say, a place of great value to a formidible enemy. Why not work towards all your goals together and forge a path that will lead to a lasting peace."

Luciel and Gorthak both look astonished. Luciel turns to the overseer. "That... strikes me as an eminently sensible proposition," she says. "If you will agree to cease your logging _here_, we will lend our strength to aid you in Azshara."

Gorthak rubs his own chin. "I do not know what quality of lumber is present in Azshara," he says. "The soil is weaker there." He looks up at Luciel. "Give me a day to think on this," he says. "But Saeren is right. We both have a war to fight in Azshara now, where we did not before. If giving up the lumber of Ashenvale is the price we will need to pay to steal the wood from under the noses of the naga... then perhaps it is a price worth paying."

Luciel looks unsatisfied, but hopeful. "A day, then. But I hope you make the right decision. You have only been our enemy for a few years..." She looks at Saeren, with new respect in her eyes. "But the naga have been our enemy for ten thousand. To finally have a hope of taking the war to them..." And her eyes glint with a light that Saeren knows well... very well indeed.
