# Turning Tides 2008-08-02

As the furbolg recedes into the distance, the party considers their situation. Silverwing Refuge is apparently under some sort of magical attack by naga and murloc forces; an unnatural lightning storm threatens the refuge, presumably protected only by its own defensive magics.

"Competing magicsss in action, hmmm." Ezra is poring through copies of _De Vermis Mysteriis_, the _Undelved Mysteries of the Abyss_, and other strange books he carries in a small sack. "Yesss, here. A ritual spell, probably casst from under the water. Or near the lake somewhere. We must go hunt down its source. Sssaeren, Nerai... prepare your weaponss. We'll ambussh the casters. They will probably have guardss, so we must be cautious."

"I hope you have some plan to make these arrows worth firing under the waves," says Saeren. She rather doubts this is going to be easy, but the ease of killing Naga rarely enters into her equations.

"Oncce we interfere with their ritual, they'll follow uss to the surface," Ezra replies calmly, waving a bandaged hand in dismissal. "That iss the danger, really. Now.. to find a way to dissrupt the spell..."

Nerai wanders over to the cart, starting to get everything tied down and tacted in to travel with the group.

The group travels north again, with Ezra's innate sense for the arcane enhanced by his magic, until he reports that they have reached the edge of the spell. Next, a westward jaunt to gain some distance, and appraching the Refuge again, allows Ezra to pinpoint the location even more precisely. He consults with Saeren and with a map of the area, and finds that there is a small island around that location, which should be in sight of the shore... but only barely, especially in the wind and rain.

As the party travels toward the shore of Mystral Lake, Saeren spies a patrol approaching - two large, heavily armed male naga with an escort of four murlocs. The two naga appear to be talking amongst themselves, although at this distance she can't make it out.

Saeren doubles back and motions the rest of the party to get the gear under cover, then sneaks back to stalk the patrol. As she approaches, keeping to the undergrowth, she can hear fragments in Nazja.

"I don't know... I think we've overextended ourselves. What if they managed to get a messenger through?" growls one of the naga. The other, apparently the superior, says, "Relax. The reinforcements are coming up from Stonetalon tonight. Even if they hold out till then, we can overwhelm them with sheer numbers. Her Ladyship has this all figured out. All we have to do is keep anyone from escaping until then."

There is more, but it mostly consists of gossip, such as is shared between military men everywhere, concerning subjects such as the shapeliness of the naga women and how they're going to enjoy themselves when the action is over.

Saeren gets her earfull and smiles. She's going to get a lot of easy hunting, she thinks. Still, it irks her that she can't shed the blood of these naga right now. The time will come for them to die later. For now, she heads back to the others and shares all she has heard.

Ezra listens carefully, nodding along. "We musst determine how those reinforcements would come, yesss," he muses aloud. "Are there underwater riverss they might use? Or would they come through the mountainss?"

"I know nothing of underground rivers," says Saeren. "Talondeep Path would be the easiest way."

Ezra taps his fingertips together. "We mussst disrupt the path, then," he says. "Iss this a job for your steam armor, Nerai? Or explosives?"

Nerai taps her chin. "Well, how big is the pass? I imagine if it were large enough to be well known, it wouldn't exactly be susceptible to closing by explosives. Especially anything I can get together in a matter of hours. Passes do make great tactical ambushes though. We could allow them through some. Explode behind them to block off the rear, me standing in front, with lots of dead naga between...."

Fortunately, the party encounters no more patrols as they approach the tunnel entrance that constitutes the Ashenvale end of the Talondeep path. Unfortunately, they find that the naga have not left it unguarded. The trees become sparse about a hundred and fifty feet from the tunnel mouth, from which vantage point Saeren can see another naga and his four murloc allies standing guard.

Saeren glares at the enemy for a moment, carefully selecting her target. The tin can naga is perfectly ripe for Ezra's attention. Instead, she'll assist one of these murlocs in shuffling off this mortal coil. Her shot is about as perfect as any arrow she's ever fired. It neatly plunges through the creature's throat, cutting off the gurgle that was about to come forth.

The arrow from the dark is followed by a sudden burst of slashing cold, as a swirling cyclone of ice shards descends on the guard camp. Far in the distance, Ezra manipulates the spell, focusing the devastation as precisely as he can manage.

Nerai, having been given the signal by Saeren, has put down the hurried work on the explosives, and jumped into Eecee as they approach. Sh e shifts a few of the knobs, and presses the 'go' button (closer and closer to working), jamming her foot against the Phlogiston pump a few times to get Eecee amovin'.

Kagarn mutters, "They send lightning against the night elves, do they? Then let them try it themselves!" His wooden totem points toward the foes, and an actinic burst of lightning crackles through the air, earthing itself on the shin of one of the nearest murlocs, which leaps free at the last moment, taking only a superficial burn on its scaled leg.

The surviving murlocs erupt from the tunnel entrance with their trademark cries, brandishing their javelins as they rush forward to bring their weapons to bear. Their naga commander, taken unawares, lags behind.

Behind the advancing murlocs, the stunned naga receives another helping of winter's chill, courtesy of the Forsaken. Revenge is indeed a dish best served cold.

Saeren's next shot, while not as impressive as the first, delivers steel to her murloc target. The arrow blasts with fire in the darkness and leaves the enemy on death's door.

Nerai's hands twiddle across the knobs on Eecee's rudimentary control surface as Nerai pounds on the speed, pushing Eecee into the thick of things, running past the arrow-happy Night Elf, and right past the few remaining Murlocs, taking a small scratch along Eecee's hull, as the point of a trident more or less catches Nerai as she runs Eecee past, and taking on a bit of Murloc blood in the process. A frustrated gurgle is all that comes from the other one, as she guns for the Naga.

The naga grits its fangs and slithers forward, wincing as shards of ice clatter off its armor and pierce its exposed flesh. Going all out, it manages to get free of Ezra's blizzard, but only just.

As the serpentine creature escapes Ezra's ice, Kagarn yells, "Let's try that again!" This time, his call upon the spirits is much louder, and the thunder of his lightning strike echoes in the valley. And the naga, unable to dodge out of the way like his lighter-footed minions, is nearly broiled in his own armor.

The murlocs quickly see that their weapons are not much use against Nerai's mighty steam armor, and instead charge further forward. The wounded one can do little but keep up, but the other two send spears flying in the direction of the doughty night elf, one of them managing to pierce her with a lucky shot.

Saeren hisses at the painful strike, but she's not going to back down now. Her next shot nearly skewers one of the two murlocs, leaving him just barely standing.

If ice won't suffice, then fire may do higher damage. Ezra mutters a few choice words in Kalimag, conjuring a blast of flame from nothing and slaying the approaching naga outright with it.

Nerai wheels Eecee around as the Naga falls before her eyes. She glares at the Murloc, and kicks Eecee into high gear again, stopping just as she reaches the Murloc, swings her Morning Star Flail. Unfortunately the weapon doesn't strike true, flying over the Murloc's head.

Kagarn furrows his massive brow at the spear protruding from Saeren's side, and steps up in two quick strides. Yanking out the spear swiftly with one hand, his other hand rests on his shoulder as he intones a prayer to the spirits, and Saeren finds that the brief burst of pain is followed by a sensation of warmth and well-being as her wounds begin to knit.

In a desperate move, the murlocs form up and throw their spears in Saeren, almost in unison. Two of them strike the night elf; but on the murlocs' side, that blow is the last it will ever strike, as it falls to the turf and moves no more.

Saeren feels the weapons of the enemy nearly destroy her in kind but keeps to her feet. The shot is far from her best, though, and falls harmlessly to the side of the farthest murloc.

The elf's bowshot is followed swiftly by three arcane cousins, who strike more truly. Ezra moves forward, getting closer to the melee.

Nerai steps back to the Murloc, who made a grave mistake in turning away from the armor. Just as Ezra's bolts crash into the creature's chest, a iron spike protrudes through to the other side, sweeping the Murloc up with Nerai's golf-like swing of her flail.

The huge tauren shakes his head. "These monsters are keeping me busy..." he says, drawing on deeper resources. Another wave of healing energy rushes through Saeren's body, and the spears fall out as the flesh closes up behind them, leaving little more than bloody marks where they had once pierced her.

Only one murloc remains. Desperate, it aims its spear at the tauren that has thwarted its efforts, and manages to graze the bull-man's arm.

Saeren smiles at Kagarn, then narrows her eyes as he is hit by the enemy. She walks forward with narrowed eyes, purposefully drawing out an arrow and aiming with a sneer. The arrow streaks out, shredding the murloc's flesh and searing the remains thoroughly. "Rot. Filth."

With the last creature dead, Saeren moves closer to the tunnel while Nerai puts the finishing touches on the explosive. Listening carefully, she hears something in the distance.

"Not to rush you, but I hear them coming," says Saeren. "You know, take your time, but if you don't get it ready really soon we're all going to die."

Ezra feels the pressure and time of the situation bearing down. Here, too, he can be useful. He strides forward, approaching the entrance to Talondeep Path. And he calls out in Nazja: "Friends from under the sea! Your Forsaken allies have a message for you."

Nerai after a few false starts, s few slips of the hand brought on by the battle, no doubt, Nerai gets teh device ready just as Saeren begins to hear the Naga coming down the pass. She starts to work installing it in a likely place just inside the mouth of the cave.

The slithering slows. There is the sound of weapons being drawn. Then a voice calls back: "Come forward and deliver your message!" The slithering resumes.

Ezra moves past Nerai, walking confidently. "There iss danger to the north," he wheedles. "The elvesss have discovered a way to undo the magicss assaulting Ssilverwind Refuge. They ssend messengerss to aid them in thiss." And this is the absolute truth. "I musst lead some of you to head off their agentss. Who will you ssend?"

"It does not matter now!" calls the voice. "We will _all_ descend upon them in force, and they will fall beneath our might!" Now Ezra can see motion; the flickering of torchlight around a bend in the cavern wall, sixty feet away. "But your assistance will be appreciated nonetheless!"

"Of coursse," the mage demurs, still stalling for time. "I ssimply thought you would have an interesst in handling thiss personally, because there iss a huntress named Ssaeren with them. A reputed naga-sslayer."

"Is that so?" calls the Nazja voice. "Well, I've got just the sort of naga to take care of that problem..." The lead naga comes around the corner, another naga visible beside him. "Hey! What's that goblin doing there?"

Nerai busily tinkers with the explosive on the rock, hurring as fast as she can with the already unstable device. As she hears the voices, and hears them mention her, she curses under her breath, and manages to get it set, pulling the device with her as she ducks around the corner.

The time for deception is clearly over. The Forsaken mage explodes into a cloud of tomb-dust. The hazy black cloud darts outward from the tunnel, making the best speed possible out of Talondeep Path.

Saeren sees Nerai dart out and Ezra do his creepy trick and moves into clear view to those in the cave. "Hi." She fires at the lead naga and knicks him. Hardly a fatal blow, but hopefully enough to get them really angry.

"Traitors! Ambush!" howls the naga, pulling the arrow out of his arm. He slithers forward at top speed, his companions following closely. A swarm of murlocs runs past him, leading the charge...

Nerai sees more of the horrible sea creatures just beginning to emerge from the tunnel, and she hears the cacophony of dozens, if not hundreds more down the tunnel. The time to act is now. She presses the button on her control.

The crack in the wall of the cave seems to be as effective as Nerai's untrained eyes will have first seen. An ear-splitting explosion pushes waves of invisible force through the rock, down the seam, deeper then she ever could have hoped. As far as 60 feet down the tunnel comes crashing down on the sea creatures, rock falling in from the side, down from the top, is a rumbling explosion and subsequent avalanche that rains stony death down upon their enemies. Down the cave it must feel like the great mountain decided to swallow the Naga and Murloc whole.

Saeren tilts her head, listening to the rumbling and crashing. The death shrieks of the naga and murlocs bring a wicked smile to her lips and she looks to Nerai. "Perfect."

The fleeing cloud of dust-motes reassemble themselves and funnel their way to the ground, building up the gaunt figure of the undead sorcerer once again. Ezra steps forward, adjusting his hat as he inspects the damage. "Very ssatisfying," he rumbles.

Kagarn observes the destruction, rubbing his horn contemplatively. As the last of the earth-slide fades into silence, he muses with characteristic understatement, "I believe we have succeeded."

"Not yet," says Saeren. "We have another target to see to, and quickly."

---

The island is just where the map said it would be. The soft banks of the lake cannot carry much weight, but Saeren has no trouble getting close to the edge of the shore. And on the island, she can see six naga women standing in a ritual circle, each of them gesturing in what almost looks like a dance... unless you observe the spiraling funnel cloud that touches the center of the circle and spreads upward, outward, into the gathering night.

Around the shore, at least a dozen males and a score of murlocs stand guard, peering intently at the shore and even over the water beyond. Silverwing Refuge is barely visible off to the east, still enduring lightning strikes.

From their hiding place, Ezra studies the situation. He watches with his faintly glowing eyes, flicking this way and that. He consults his books. He taps his fingertips together or drums them on the lush Ashenvale grass. Finally he speaks. "Ssaeren, prepare an arrow." He points. "That one. When I say. I will tap out the rhythm for you, yess. When you feel it, you musst fire immediately. Do not hessitate." With these instructions, he puts a withered claw atop the elf's shoulder and begins to beat out a steady rhythm with two fingers.

Saeren readies an arrow as instructed, watching and barely even breathing. She focuses on the body of the indicated target, her whole world narrowed to a patch of flesh hardly larger than a fingertip.

Saeren doesn't even waste the air to curse as she misses, readying another arrow and ignoring the attention her actions might draw. She has only her target to think of.

The first shot whizzes past the naga, and the entire island suddenly snaps to attention. Fortunately for Saeren, none of the ritual's defenders saw the source of the arrow, but all of them are on high alert now.

This time, the arrow is perfectly placed. The tallest of the six naga staggers for one crucial moment, and then begins to gesture madly... but it is too late. The howling tornado in the center of the circle flicks its tail, and all six of the naga spellcasters are bowled over, and then sucked into the suddenly expanding storm. The rest of the naga and murlocs leap into the water and begin swimming toward Saeren at an impossibly fast pace, but the last lightning stroke over Silverwind gutters out like a blown-out candle.

Saeren lowers her bow and turns to get far away from where she is now. "Time to get the hell out of here, people." At least now the odds have improved for Silverwind.

As Saeren and Ezra make their frenzied escape, the nearest murlocs rear out of the water and throw their spears. Unfortunately for them, a spear does not fly nearly as far as an arrow, and they all fall short. By the time they are ready to throw again, they have hit land once more, and begin to fall behind.

The two adventurers leap onto the cart, and Nerai urges the mules to their best running speed. The beasts need no encouragment, as the unnatural sounds of the murlocs behind them spur them on. And so they flee... right into the fins of a patrol.

The lead naga grins evilly and raises his axe. "Get them!" he hollers and begins to slither forward... only to halt, stagger, and fall over, a rough-hewn spearhead poking through his chest. Behind him, several more crude spears fall amongst the murlocs, and a dozen shaggy furbolgs emerge from the woods behind them.

Meanwhile, the sounds of pursuit behind them suddenly give way to the sounds of battle. Turning, the adventurers can see the first wave of night elves from Silverwing, all astride black nightsabers, plow into the murlocs. The rest of the furbolgs swarm around Saeren, Ezra, Nerai, and Kagarn, and join battle against the suddenly outnumbered aquatics.

All the furbolgs, that is, except two. One of them nods to Ezra, holding up the knife that Ezra had given him and climbs aboard the cart, lifting out one of the bodies. The other, festooned with a feathered headdress, nods, before returning to the battle. There may be other furbolgs that fall today, but it is clearly this one that will preside over their return to the earth.

Nerai hops into the back of Eecee and joins the fray, her rhythm is on as the surge of battle turns, rolling over the Murlocs and Naga as so much gravel as the creatures fall under the swinging flail one after another.

Now that the fight is a good one, Saeren is off the cart and into the wood in moments. Her purpose is simple: empty her quiver into the enemy. In the dark it's hard for her to tell how many she kills, fighting beside so many allies, but it doesn't matter. It can never be enough.

And Kagarn too is busy, but for a different reason. Even surrounded and outnumbered, the murlocs and naga fight desperately, and some of their blows find flesh. Kagarn is not far behind the vanguard of his allies, ensuring that the wounds from the deep ones are healed as swiftly as they are dealt.

Finally it is over. Some of the defenders of Silverwind have fallen, as have a few of the furbolgs. But none of the creatures of the Old Gods will live to see the next day. And as the last murloc falls, as if in response, the thick clouds of the naga's thunderstorm finally dissipate, and the light of Elune bathes the survivors with her silvery radiance.
