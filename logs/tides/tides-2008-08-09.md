# Turning Tides 2008-08-09

In the aftermath of the battle, several things become evident. First, the naga do not constitute an immediate threat to Silverwind Refuge. Their plan was clear eonugh, when one of the sentinel scouts uncovers a familiar-looking chalice. Ezra's eyes light up as he sees this, and he rubs his hands together in anticipation.

Second, the reclusive Night Elves and their arboreal homeland are strangers to Nerai's way of mechanized combat. Just as the powerful steam armor took the murlocs and naga by surprise, it leaves the nature-loving elves with little to suggest for repairs. The sentinels equip themselves with leather and the occasional suit of scale armor sewn from the hides of the large sea-beasts off the coast. Metal armor is scarce; actual engineering supplies are nonexistent.

Nerai's immediate concern is for Eecee. This is the first real settlement she's been in, with a chance to patch the armor up. She wanders into the town, asking several of the elves where the forge might be. Unfortunately, although not really surprising, she has almost as much trouble getting an answer from the aloof and proud race as she does finding the actual forge. And with a people who make most of their wear from hide and wood, they have precious little in the way of engineering supplies. Her task having more or less failed, she seeks out Ezra, more or less to report.

Nerai secures Eecee in what seems to be a secure location. The elves seem to respect her property, if not her. She finds Kagarn first. The Tauren seems to be in deep discussions with one of Silverwind's druids. She listens to the conversation for a while, standing politely nearby as the magical nature of their work, a closed book to Nerai, is discussed. Kagarn turns to Nerai, briefly, "Yes?" He seems to be cherishing the time to speak with a kindred spirit. Nerai asks about Ezra's whereabouts, and is ushered off in the direction of the last known whereabouts of the chalice.

Ezra can be found on the edge of the Refuge. The Night Elves have no particular love for the Forsaken, and that animosity has not been improved by the recent battle. He is still a zombie animated by unholy magic, a creature of darkness, a member of the Horde - everything that is antithetical to the elves' way of life. He is sitting in the company of Oakpaw.

Oakpaw is the shaman of the Greenpaw furbolgs. While he has no great love for the Forsaken, and though he is tied even more closely to the earth than the elves, he is also closer to the primal needs of life. The travelers saved the furbolgs, gave them life, gave them back their dead. They will be treated equitably.

Nerai walks into the circle, her tools clanking at her sides as she does so. Her glance turns to Ezra, as she watches the Forsaken and the furblogs in conference. She moves to stand in the circle, but makes mo sound or other motion, waiting to see what is being discussed.

The mage is in conversation, alternately uttering ursine noises and speaking in recognizable languages. Oakpaw is teaching him to speak the furbolg language, it seems, for the shaman will draw pictures in the dirt and then speak a word. Ezra will repeat it. Then the two will talk further.

Nerai watches the language lesson for a while, but wanders on after a short time. It seems Ezra is perhaps busy as well. Ah well. She wanders off, inquiring with several sentinels about the location of her last party member. It appears, the only one who might actually be accepted by the outpost is still out on the hunt, finishing off after the main battle. Nerai shrugs, and wanders back to where Eecee and the wagon is parked. Making sure that the animals are taken care of, she sets about work, mostly mindlessly tinkering with Eecee. At least, as much as she can without a forge.

"Enjoying yourself?" Saeren isn't one to linger politely or sooth nerves. She intrudes on the apparently useless efforts of the goblin with little care. "I am not an expert of ironmongery, but I think you're a few tools shy there."

Nerai peers over at Saeren. "It would seem so indeed. Of course, if the elves has use for anything resembling a forge that could melt more then ice..." She calms her temper slightly, and turns back, "But, after all, what more is there for a goblin to do?" She grins, but does manage to extract herself from the linkage, and plop down from the cart.

"Our few forges are a ways from here," says Saeren. "I have little use for this place myself," the elf admits. "We have won this battle. It is time we move on. Where is Ezra?"

"Last I saw him he was talking to the furblogs." She starts to walk in that direction, guiding Saeren to Ezra's previous location. She suspects that perhaps Saeren's desire to be constantly on the hunt with conflict with Ezra's goals, she decides to tactfully stay quiet about this now.

"Ah, good," says Saeren. "We'll need more allies in this, I think." The night elf shortens her stride, providing a rare example of manners to Nerai. "I imagine this is going to be as boring as watching paint dry, though, isn't it?"

Nerai shrugs, "It was last time I was there. Of course, I assume you watching me recalibrate the escapement pump is about that much fun too. To each their own."

The night elf smirks. "My interests span only a very narrow band." As if that wasn't pretty obvious from the first. She notices a few looks of admiration from the sentinels she passes and grumbles. "Looking up to my like some idiot hero. Fools."

Nerai looks up to Saeren. "I could be worse, of course. You could have my reception." She nods at the circle in one corner of the camp where Ezra and the furblogs are staked out.

"I'm used to yours," says Saeren. "I prefer it." She heads towards Ezra, happily noting the anti-elf radius the forsaken has generated.

The mage waves casually as the two approach. "I've just learned the word for the sound a heart makes when you snap it in your jaws," he explains with what passes for a smile under his bandaged features. "Their language takes peculiar, specialized turns."

Nerai nods to Ezra. Language, generally at least a tool for most goblins, who wouldn't hardly let communication stand between a good sale, has been a closed book to Nerai. She does sort of smile at this, not sure how much of this is a joke or not.

"And here I thought they'd have nothing worth saying," says Saeren. She smirks and settles near the pair, carelessly imposing her presence whether desired or not. "I've been out hunting the remnants. A few pathetic groups is all I encountered."

"The elvess will need to ssettle this business in Stonetalon Mountains, yess," Ezra nods. "Who knows how strong they are on the other sside of Talondeep Path. An excellent job, I must add." He gestures to Nerai.

Nerai does preen a bit, inspite of herself. "It was a closer call then I would have liked. But perhaps this is the best way." She ponders for a moment, "So, with the pass closed, I wonder how much time we've really bought here." She ponders out loud.

"It's not a quesstion of time." Ezra rises, bowing to Oakpaw before addressing his companions fully. "You ssee... in the ancient passt, the Night Elves were sslow to awake to the threats facing them. But in the end, their power changed the facce of two wars and ssaved the world." He gestures around him. "Here in this foresst, the sleepers are slow to awaken. We buy time for that powerful forcce."

"They will wake," says Saeren. "This time I believe the warning has come earlier, the danger is more clear."

"One can only hope that the force isn't put off by the messengers of it's need." Nerai shrugs, and looks at Saeren. "One can only hope, to be sure." She looks to Ezra, "So, what is our next move? Do we bring the message further a field? Has anyone asked anything more of us?"

"No one need assk," the undead answers. He clasps his hands together. "We go to Darnasssus, yess. We musst warn the elven leadership directly. These small skirmishes will be our evidence. And there is sstill more that needs done. There are Forssaken working for the naga still."

Ezra hunkers down before Nerai, with an unnatural flexibility born of undeath. "Lissten to me. Thiss may not have been your fight before. You musst decide if you will come with uss, and do what musst be done. There are enough dangers in our world already. We cannot allow another to risse, no."

Nerai, for her part, blinks, "I think, Ezra." She nods, "That it became my fight a long time ago. Perhaps before I was even aware." She says. "Besides, I would be more worried about being a risk, rather then a help. But I pledge I will do everything I can to help you with this task."

"This is everyone's fight who doesn't want to wear gills," says Saeren.

"Yess. Which bringss us to your fighting sstyle. Your mechanical monster, 'Eecee'.. it doess not repair itself, that I have seen." Ezra taps his cane on the ground in thought. "There are spellss to repair animated constructss, yes... certainly such magic could be adapted to repair this damage. But that will take time."

"I rather doubt my people will be of much use in this," says Saeren.

"Yess." The mage's glowing eyes regard Saeren in turn. "They musst provide their own power. Which is consssiderable. As we have sseen from your performance thus far, yes."

Saeren frowns and nods. "They have power. Power that goes beyond the killing I have done. You are far from helpless when it comes time to destroy the enemy, as well. Do you think your people will be divided on this matter?"

"They are already divided, yesss." Ezra steps away from the furbolg, away from the distant Night Elves, toward the wild forest, and beckons for the others to follow.

"You ssee, the Forssaken are not born. They have no family. Each of us, all of us, without excception, threw off the mental domination of the Lich King, yesss. Even now I hear his whisspers in my mind." Ezra eyes Saeren through his bandages. "Even now he wantss me to put my handss around your throatss, to choke the life out of you, to kill the hated elvess here. It was the Dark Lady who showed uss how to be free again. We owe everything to her. But ssometimes we .. forget that, yess."

"Are there Forsaken who will move against her?" asks Saeren. "Or perhaps they have lost control once more."

The mage shakes his head. "No. Even the agent I .... interrogated ... felt loyalty and fear, yess. They do not move againsst her, rather... they move in similar directionss, yes. The naga promisse.... similar things as the Dark Lady herself. I think ssome of us are swayed by ssuch promises."

"And the naga do move against those who might threaten your people," says Saeren. "And it would seem, at first glance, that they might not be a threat to the Forsaken."

"They are a threat to what the Forsaken wissh to be," Ezra says obliquely.

Nerai nods in response to Ezra's question. "Such magics would be of use, yes." She ponders, "Of course, given a good forge and time, I should be able to reinforce Eecee's armor myself." She glances around, "Of course, as is recently demonstrated, forges are hard to find. But magics are, seemingly, omnipresent."

Ezra shakes his head. "Magic iss a powerful force. The world is ssuffused with magical power. It is more refined than your 'science'. But it, too, has its limits..."

Nerai shrugs. "When your hands are small and crafty, and you carry tools on your belt, you have much of the craft at hand, as it were." She beams a smile at Ezra. "But back to task, what do you need of me to make these spells work? Past my personal interest, it seems like such things would be the utility of our style of fighting..."

"I must research such magics, yess.." Ezra muses. "In that, I am at as much of a dissadvantage among the Night Elvess as you."

Nerai nods to Ezra. "It seems I have the unique distinction of being the squarest peg in the joint."

"But you bring abilitiess we lack, yess," points out Ezra. "Consider the cave-in you were able to accomplissh."

Nerai laughs. "Oh. I certainly have no need of elvish approval to think myself important."

"I find life is better without such approval," says Saeren.

"In my case, it's not sso much lack of approval as... lack of lore." Ezra gestures around him. "In these foressts, arcane magic such as mine is not welcome, no.. But thiss means that I cannot find the research materialss I need."

Nerai shrugs, "So, to Darnassus, I assume?"

"Not likely to be found there, either," murmurs Saeren.

Ezra laughs aloud. It's a sound that shouldn't be repeated. "I have been trying to think of wayss to avoid being killed outright as I enter the Night Elf city, yesss..."

"Maybe my newfound fame will help with that," says Saeren. Her sarcasm could be cut with a knife.

Ezra nods. "Yess. Your presence is what I am relying on."

"Ironic. Your presence is also what I am relying on," says Saeren.
