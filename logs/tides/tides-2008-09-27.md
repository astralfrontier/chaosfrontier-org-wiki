# Turning Tides 2008-09-27

Maestra's Post is a defensive outpost, and looks it. The camp is dominated by a stone spire tall enough to overlook the entrance ramp, with a handful of structures mounted around it. Night elf sentinels are visible everywhere, looking worried. More than a few turn to glare at Ezra as the party is escorted through the camp.

Ezra makes no sudden moves, no obvious gestures. Indeed, he seems almost gratified by the elves' hostility. His hat is pulled low, over his face, hiding his eyes from the taller night elves, and his black Lordaeron war-coat and white bandages form a stark enough contrast to the natural and organic colors the elves favor.

Nerai is driving the cart, casting her eyes around the very distructful night elves. SOmethign about the less than warm reception guts under Nerai's skin. The folk here may believe they are acting honorably, but it's no sort of honor Nerai can recognize.

The group is escorted to one of the smaller buildings, where three night elves are loitering in a cage, looking grim - although they all look up as Ezra approaches. A human is at a nearby workbench, working on some business that seems to involve a collection of herbs and vials. "Here, Delgren," says the leader of the sentinel escort. "This Forsaken says he knows how to cure our people. Get what you can out of him."

The human turns, and his eyes rove over the group that has been brought before him. "How odd," he muses as his eyes pass over Nerai. "The scouts hadn't said anything about goblins working with the Forsaken." He glances at Saeren. "And what's her story? She isn't infected, is she? If she is, you should put her with the others."

"She iss not infected. Thesse... have they assked for water? And been given it?" Ezra peers at the captives through their cages, bandaged face contorted in a grin.

"Of course we have," says the human. "We aren't barbarians. We're treating them with proper care while we work on a cure."

Nerai looks over at Delgren. Looking at him about his work. She opens her mouth, but closes it again. There's nothing to say, is there? Tend to the wounded, and get out so the people here can continue their small minded little existance. Nerai decides disgression is the better part of valor, and simply stands to the side, letting Ezra work. "Erza, do we have any idea when Kagarn should return?"

The wizard shakes his head. "We will need him, or a priesst, yes. Ssomeone who can cleanse this dark curse." He peers at Delgren. "You are out of placce here, just as I. We both wissh the besst for these people. Now..." He begins to describe the process of magically curing Jonah, and the others, at Tiragarde.

The human - who is indeed Delgren - listens to Ezra's tale. "Interesting," he says, finally. "There's just one problem, though. These people -" he says, gesturing to the night elves in the cage, "seem to be quite satisfied with fresh water. Are you proposing that we deprive them of that as well?"

Ezra shakes his head. "I only say what we have sseen. If they do not show a craving for sseawater, it ssimpy means the condition hass not progressed. But you musst still purify them, yess."

Delgren smiles grimly at that. "You propose to tell me my work, Forsaken," he says. "I have tried, of course, but nothing I have done seems to have helped so far. Oh, they _claim_ it has helped," he says, looking one of his 'patients' in the eye, "but the gills remain." He rubs his chin. "My magic seems... insufficient for the task. Perhaps one among you can serve better?"

Ezra nods, and gestures to Nerai. "As my companion has ssuggested, there is a tauren shaman who will return to uss shortly, named Kagarn. He iss of the Earthen Ring. If he cannot cure them, he will know who can."

"We will wait, then," says Delgren. "Make yourselves comfortable." The sentinel leader moves toward an empty cage, but Delgren waves his hand. "No need for that," he says. "Watch them, of course, but I do not think we are among enemies here."

Saeren glares as the suggestion is made to put them in a cage, her hand going to an arrow as easy as she takes a breath. "I begin to suspect that other than my companions I have nothing but enemies."

Nerai shakes her head, and sits off into the corner. Her eyes glance between the elves locked in cages, to Saeren, to Delgren, and then back to the floor. "Is there a forge here?" She asks, noone in particular.

The sentinel leader looks coolly at Saeren. "If you count your own kind as enemies, you have no one to blame but yourself, for the company you keep," she says. "Perhaps you would find yourself more comfortable among the infected?"

"My own kind made that choice for me long ago," replies Saeren. "My company has its eyes and mind open."

Nerai looks around the hut, "Sometimes, a kind abandons the individual. And sometimes the individual advances beyond the kind."

"_Really_?" says the sentinel, stepping in front of Saeren. "And what did we ever do to you?" Before things can escalate further, though, a shadow passes over the door. It is Kagarn, with his own well-armed escort of sentinels. "It would seem," he says phlegmatically, "that the closer we come to the front lines, the less trust we find. Understandable, especially given what they face."

The sentinel leader turns swiftly to face Kagarn. "You," she says, her lambent eyes narrowing. "You are the one called Kagarn, are you not? They said you were to spy on the Twilight's Hammer. What did you find?"

The Forsaken waves genially at the enormous shaman, then gestures to the cages. "Cure them, please?" he asks.

Saeren looks past the sentinel to Kagarn as she answers, "You did nothing. Absolutely nothing. That was enough."

The massive tauren glances over the room, and pulls out his totem, moving to the cages. "I found a small encampment of orcs and trolls," he says. "All bearing the emblems of the Twilight's Hammer. No more than a dozen. I suspect they were a single cell. One moment..." he says, mumbling a prayer to the spirits.

Saeren is favored with a glare, and a shake of the head. "Whatever your problem is, I doubt you will find a solution here. Not until you decide you wish to." To the tauren: "We have faced more than a single cell here. You have not found but a fraction of the foes that are arrayed against us."

The tauren's eyes are closed, and a warm green glow plays about his hands. One of the infected elves stiffens, her eyes clenched tight shut. The tableau continues for a while, and then they both relax, Kagarn looking discouraged. "This curse lingers," he says. "I shall need more time to work on them." He turns to the sergeant. "Indeed, I did not," he says. "But while I watched, a naga and two murlocs approached, and spoke for some time. I was too far to hear their words, alas. I am not trained in the art of infiltration, and dared not approach closer."

The Forsaken wizard chuckles unpleasantly. "Saeren is," he points out. "Ssaeren, will you do ssomething for me?"

"As long as I'm killing naga it's doing something for me," replies the elf. "Just tell me what you need done."

Ezra nods. "Jusst so. Find the Forssaken camp for me. Slay any naga or murlocs you find if you wish, yess. Just be ssure that we know where my undead .... brethren operate from."

Ezra points at the captives. "Meanwhile, Kagarn will do hiss best. And perhaps they can .. remember the path as well."

Saeren nods to Ezra and is off swiftly, not looking back, not caring what she leaves behind.

The night elves move as if to block Saeren, but their leader raises a hand. "She is not infected," says the sergeant. "Let her move as she will. As much as she seems to dislike us, I do not think she works with our enemies. Perhaps she will learn something of value. And perhaps she will even tell us," she adds, her voice dripping with scorn.

Ezra beckons to Nerai. "For now, we sshould find you your tools." He rises to move as well. But he stops at the sergeant, staring. "Also.... I am sorry for your loss," he says quietly.

Nerai nods happily at Ezra and stands up, ready to be surrounded by a hot forge and working tools. Plus it'll probably piss off the elves even more, and they seem to thrive off of being unhappy. She looks between Ezra and Delgren as Ezra speaks.

Delgren rises as well. "If the goblin requires help with metalworking," he says, "I can assist. Our order must often repair their armor in the field, and securing a forge was my own first priority when I arrived."

---

Nerai show Delgren over to the cart, and allows him to lead up to the forge. She is wary of letting Delgren actually touch Eecee. (But, to be fair, she's wary of anyone touching her friend.) She takes the armor plates off of the hull, and hands them down to Delgren. After a little bit of pounding and tacking, things are as good as new, and the bolts are re tightened.

Saeren's task is (for her) quite simple. As usual, the naga are relaying messages in person with murlocs to guard them. Though they may be swift and familiar with the terrain, the night elf hunter cannot be shaken, and follows them for hours to locate the Forsaken camp.

Upon reaching the camp, Saeren does her usual exercise of counting the enemy (over a score of Forsaken), looking for sigils she might recognize or at least describe to others, and takes careful note of any defenses. The whole study takes her only thirty minutes and then she is returning from her task, using the same care as when she left. She has not seen the Twilight Hammer, but when she returns Ezra will recognize the symbols of the Apothecary Society as she describes them.

As Saeren is returning, Kagarn emerges from the hut, looking weary and shaking his head. "Their curse is too strong yet," he says. "And I am concerned. By Ezra's account, the fresh water they have been given should not have slaked their thirst. And yet they have gills; they should not have gills if the curse had not progressed."

Nerai muses on this, "Could the forsaken have found a way to alter the curse?"

Ezra thinks rapidly. "Yess. This cursse may be different than the one I saw before, yesss," he concludes. "Different, or sstronger. Or it may be a trap, set to deceive the elvess." He taps his fingers together. "We musst obtain one of the chalices used here, yes. Study it. Compare it. Undersstand what happened."

Nerai nods. "It could be that the original cure does not work on the elves, and something similar was manufactured to keep the elves in check?"

Ezra bobs his head again. "The Apothecary Society iss.. well-versed in this sort of thing," he murmurs. "We musst learn more."

---

Ezra stands with his companions, facing the elven sentinels and Delgren. "We musst stop the Forssaken first," he says calmly. "I wissh to go and assk that they withdraw from thiss matter. If they do not... then ssentinels should be ready, directly near the camp, to .. make a more compelling argument, yess. I believe that it is they, and not the cultistss, who are ressponsible for the eh, improvements in the curse."

"A bold plan," says Orendil Broadleaf, a male night elf who, though not a sentinel, seems to speak for Maestra's Post. "What of the Horde, then? We have the strength to oppose a Forsaken encampment of that size, but if the Horde takes offense, we could find ourselves in a... precarious position. Can you guarantee that attacking the Forsaken here will not lead to an incident?"

"Do you have a choice but to defend yourselves?" asks Saeren. "If they work with the naga they have already started the offensive against the Night Elves. They don't seem particularly concerned about diplomacy."

Rather than answering, or arguing, or persuading, Ezra simply withdraws a letter sent to him from the Undercity. A letter written from the highest levels of the Forsaken rulership, speaking of those undead in Ashenvale which now trouble the elves. He presents it to Orendil Broadleaf, then steps back.

The night elf peruses the letter, and though he does not smile, his bearing seems more relaxed. "This allays one of my greatest worries in the matter," he says. "Swiftfire," he says, addressing the sentinel standing next to him, "you will organize an assault. Send a scouting party ahead with Ezra, but keep the main force behind. I will discuss a more detailed plan with you after Ezra leaves with the scouts."

Ezra is soon accompanied, and by a different six elves than the platoon that greeted him. Saeren, Nerai, and Kagarn are firmly requested to remain behind and join the main assault when it departs.

Half an hour later, the edge of the Forsaken camp is in sight. "Go on," hisses the sentinel beside him. "We'll wait for you to return. You know the passwords. If you do not return in an hour, we will launch the attack without you."

Ezra begins weaving some arcane magic - to the evident disgust and revulsion of some of the elves - and begins trudging forward, making his patient way toward the camp. His own life is at stake, as well as those of others.

As Ezra approaches, his welcome is all too familiar. As soon as he is visible, the nearest two Forsaken raise the sturdy-looking crossbows they carry and bellow, "Halt and declare yourself, in the name of the Lady!" A third backs away to watch from a distance.

"The name of the Lady, eh?" wheezes Ezra. "What a joke. Move aside, I musst speak with your ssuperior, yess."

"You will remain where you are!" barks the first, while the one who backed away runs further into the camp. A few moments later, another Forsaken emerges, this one wearing robes that denote a somewhat higher rank among the Apothecaries, as well as two more crossbow-wielding escorts. "Come, brother," he says to Ezra. "Let us speak somewhere more... private." He grins at Ezra, though given that he has lost most of the flesh below his nose, he hardly has much choice in the matter.

Ezra is escorted into a smaller tent, and his companion takes a seat opposite him. "Let us not mince wordss," he says. "You are not one of our group, and you did not ressspond with the passphrase. That means you are sent from someone elsssse. Tell me... what do _you_ want?"

"I want you to leave, before you are destroyed by the elves. And if not them, by the naga." Ezra whispers his request in a cold, steady voice. "These are not the allies we need, no. Undercity knowss you are here. If I do not return, more will be ssent. You are a danger to all that the Dark Lady workss for. But it is not too late."

The undead looks long and hard at Ezra. "Undercity? They do not understand..." he begins, and then his shoulders slump. "But to be honest with you, I am no longer sure that I do. The naga have brought us the chalice, yessss. Valuable information about plagues, yesss. But I think... I think they are using usss. Asking for _us_ to improve _their_ plague, taking our secretsss freely... yet do they give us any information about how theirs works? They do not. We must learn it all ourselves. 'Patience,' they say. 'All will be revealed.' Does Joseph know what he is doing, I wonder? Does even Daniel? I do not know anymore."

Ezra nods slowly. "Yess. This is the way of the naga. Sadly, they are much like the elvess in that regard." He gestures around him to the forest. "You have doubtss. You musst act on them. We _must_ be secure. We must be unified, my brother. Leave thiss forest and thiss plot behind. Make what excusess you want. But this _must be stopped_."

The other undead looks uncertain. "If Daniel is right... this _is_ for the good of Undercity. The Plan will... ensssure that we will be able to live in peace, no longer troubled by the living _or_ the Scourge. That... is too great a prize to throw away lightly."

"And what doess the Dark Lady say to hiss plan, hmm?" asks Ezra. "Think on thiss. The naga worship this Old God, this 'Dagun'. Surely they will attack the surface racess, then... leave the Forssaken alone? Do you believe that, hmm?"

"Dagun?" says the other, uncomprehending. "Old Gods? What are you talking about?"

"I ssee they have not told you enough even now," murmurs Ezra. "The Twilightss Hammer worship the Old Gods, yess. One of the five. This one is Dagun, who livess in the ssea. The naga alsso follow him. Or had you thought there was another reason why that power-hungry cult now allied itsself with the sea-witches?"

Ezra reaches into a pocket and withdraws the hammer symbol. "You ssee. Two orcss and a demon of ssome kind attacked uss on the road. Yess, they are allies of the naga."

"Twilight's Hammer? Those madmen?!" declares the Apothecary, rising. "You mean to tell me we are working with _them_?" Despite the bony grin, every last muscle remaining in the undead face registers his contempt and horror. "That does it! I-" he begins, going to the tent flap, and then pauses. He sidles back and raises a finger to his teeth. A few moments later, another undead appears. "James! Who is this you have found?" says the other, clearly higher-ranking by his robes.

"He... comes from Undercity," says James. "He... wishes to join ussss, yes."

The newcomer turns to Ezra. "Is thiss true? What iss your name, stripling?"

"Ezra L. Pyreborn," the wizard answers, offering a mocking bow.

"Is that so?" says the other, his lips turning up in a hideous smile. "This is excellent. Daniel spoke highly of you. How much has James told you of what we've been doing here?" James makes as if to leave the tent... but pauses at the doorway and turns, his hand moving to his belt.

"The Royal Apothecary Society's skills and methods are known throughout the Forsaken," Ezra replies obliquely. "However, this new cursse has been quite fascinating to obsserve. I've seen the elvess who you sent back, you know."

"Really? Have they been discovered yet? It's a shame we couldn't do anything to disguise the gills, though removing the salt-water limitation was quite a masterstr-" he begins, only to be cut off with a startled gurgle. He looks down to find three inches of slightly glowing steel protruding from his chest.

The undead flesh hisses around the blade, and he looks down at it. "James..." he begins, but looks directly at Ezra, knowing the mage must've seen his subordinate prepare the killing strike, but said nothing. "Why? Why, Timothy? Daniel was so s-sure you'd... be one of us..." He falls to his knees, then slumps to the ground, and the ghost-light fades from his eyes.

Ezra nods approvingly. "You have learned the price of betrayal," he hisses at the ex-zombie. Turning to his newfound ally, he gestures outside of the tent. "Now. We musst act so that you and your fellowss are safe. And... we musst cure the elvess at Maestra's Post. Please come with me."

James nods, carefully wiping the blade with a cloth while obviously taking care not to touch the metal. "Of course," he says. "I can show you the modified chalice. I took the liberty of researching a cure, just in case." He pauses at the edge of the tent. "Why did he call you Timothy, by the way?"

Ezra shakes his head. "Losst to madness, no doubt," he says, giving no indication of what he might actually think.

---

James is as good as his word. Ezra returns to the night elf scouts, James in tow, and gives the passphrase to indicate all-clear. The night elves are clearly displeased, but allow the two undead to return, James carrying the chalice as well as a black leather alchemist's bag.

Back at Maestra's Post, Kagarn nods approvingly as James describes the nature of the antidote. "Black widow venom? Very devious. A non-lethal dose, and yet what healer would think to include it? Let us try."

The three night elf captives had looked hopeful when James entered, but when it becomes clear that he has turned against their dark master, they become agitated. Indeed, the first one to receive the antidote struggles mightily, and requires four sentinels to restrain him before Kagarn can force the vial between his lips. He chokes on it, and begins to scream out an epithet before Kagarn's prayer to the spirits washes over him. By degrees, he relaxes, and the gills melt into his skin and fade away. "Tastes foul," he says, wiping his mouth as the sentinels release him. "And I'd drink a bucket of it, if that's what it took to cure me."

Orendil, looking on, is clearly pleased. "You have been as good as your word, James of the Forsaken. Will you help us further against the naga?" James 'grins' with his whole face. "I have several ideas on that score. Let us discuss them."

As the two leaders decamp and Kagarn moves on to the next patient, the rest of the elves seem more relaxed. At least one threat to their well-being is seemingly neutralized, and while they still evidently do not wholly trust Ezra _or_ James as yet, they no longer fear for their spirits and their souls.

"Well, the first part of the deal is done," says Saeren. "All that remains is my favorite part, I think. Soon it will be time to hunt again."

Nerai shrugs to herself. She's glad the initial phase turned out okay, but is unclear to their next moves. And the ones after that.

Ezra has removed himself from the area. Now that James and perhaps other Forsaken have been returned to the elvish outpost to cure the captives, the wizard is sometimes seen by the sentinels, sitting on the tallest branches of the enormous trees that grow around the Post. He waves to when called, but otherwise seems to prefer solitude.

Eventually, Orendil and James emerge from their discussions, which have, by all rumor, grown heated at times. It is clear that the Forsaken are still not truly welcome in Ashenvale - but that there is at least one thing they can usefully do. The naga are definitely encamped on the shores of the ocean north of Zoram'gar Outpost, where the entrance to Blackfathom Deeps is located; with the Forsaken openly participating, it will be easier for Zoram'gar to tolerate the night elf forces in their assault on the naga.

In the meantime, Kagarn has made it clear that his plans still lead to Zoram'gar itself. He still has a report to deliver to the Earthen Ring there, about the deviousness of the goblins and their attempts on his own life. His newfound companions are invited as well, to help him describe the new threat he has discovered since then - and to assure his superiors that some goblins are trustworthy after all.
