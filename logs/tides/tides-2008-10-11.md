# Turning Tides 2008-10-11

As the night elves of Maestra's Post prepare for war, Kagarn Stormhoof grows restless. At a war council under Orendil, he voices his concerns.

"I must speak with Je'neu of the Earthen Ring," he says. "If the Twilight's Hammer is operating here, Je'neu would be interested in their movements, more so even than yourselves. In their recklessness to harness the power of the elementals, the Twilight's Hammer has oft disrupted the balance, and my people oppose them at any turn. I would seek his counsel at Zoram'gar."

"An emissary to Zoram'gar would be of use to us as well," says Orendil, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. "Will you speak for one of my people if I send them to Zoram'gar with you?"

Kagarn nods. "Of course. The disarray of the elements touches all who walk on this earth. Still, two people will find it difficult to make the trek through these hostile lands." The tauren turns to his traveling companions. "My friends - if such I may call you," he says. "We have traveled long together. I would ask that you accompany me on one more journey. And... perhaps beyond. Je'neu may have need of strong hands to act against the servants of the Old Gods, in ways that armies cannot."

"I am already committed to thiss, as you must know," Ezra says. "I will go wherever it will be a benefit, yess."

Nerai nods, "Of course, Kagarn. This quest doesn't belong to you, or anyone. We're really on in this together." She smiles at Kagarn, and looks around the group.

Saeren looks at the night elves for a moment, thinking of all the obnoxious heroic worship she's experience as of late, then turns to Kagarn, "So we're going to a place where people will probably hate me based on my race alone? I'm in."

Orendil regards Saeren contemplatively. "You may be doomed to disappointment, young one. Our relations with Zoram'gar have been rather strained, of late, but they have seldom been worse than cordial." If he has any further thoughts about Saeren's remark, he does not speak them.

"I'll take my chances. At least when I start out in adversity I know when people respect me, rather than admire some ghost they imagine me to be," replies Saeren.

"Safe journeys then," says Orendil. "May Elune go with you." His eyes pass over the motley crew. "If all goes well, we will be prepared to assault the beaches at Blackfathom within a fortnight. My emissary will carry a map with her. Take care to ensure that it does not fall into the hands of the enemy; and if you, or the trolls of Zoram'gar, would stand with us there, the map will tell you where to rally."

---

For once, the journey through the wildlands of Ashenvale is relatively uneventful. Even the wildlife is scarce. "The elements are already out of balance," comments Kagarn. "And the animals feel it, whether they know it not." The enemy itself is sighted once only - a single murloc imagines itself to be hidden from prying eyes as it prowls through the forest, a mistake which Saeren tersely explains to it with a single shaft of flaming wood.

Soon, forest gives way to scrub, and scrub to the sand of a beach. Far to the north, marble columns sprout from the sand, leaning drunkenly. "The ruins of our ancestors," explains the night elf emissary. Vague movement can be seen among them - from this distance, even Saeren's eyes cannot perceive more than that, though she would swear that the shapes she saw bore fins.

Ahead are a collection of thatch-and-wood huts - though even from here, they are clearly of troll building, rather than murloc. "Zoram'gar Outpost," confirms the emissary, and soon they are accosted by a troll with a bandolier of light axes. "Who goes there?" hisses the troll.

Kagarn speaks up, stepping forth from the scrub. "I am Kagarn Stormhoof of the Earthen Ring," he says. "I bring with me an emissary from Maestra's Post, and other allies of the Earthen Ring." The troll relaxes somewhat, reassured by the tauren despite the presence of two night elves, and leads the way into the village.

Nerai mutters to Saeren as they're lead through the village, "Man, you guys sure know how to make friends, eh?"

Two orcs join the troll and form up around the party to act as an escort - a wise precaution, as the other Zoram'gar trolls and orcs regard the adventurers with wary suspicion - and lead them to the largest of the huts. There they find an orc sitting in a large wickerwork chair. "Lok'tar, friends," he says. "I would speak with the Maestra emissary," he says, nodding to the night elf. "Kagarn... Stormhoof, was it? Je'neu is away from the village, but he is expected to return shortly. Make yourselves at home."

Kagarn and the other adventurers are guided to another hut near the chieftain's hut, which is strewn with all sorts of carved wood, feathers, and other such relics which Kagarn seems to find comforting. Even as he settles in to wait, a voice calls out from the door. "Kagarn! How be you, mon!" A troll jumps lithely across the threshold and clasps hands warmly with the tauren. "It be good to see you good an' healthy! How go things with the-" he begins, cutting off as he glares at Nerai.

The tauren is quick to speak. "Je'neu Sancrea, this is my good friend, Nerai. She and her other friends, Saeren Finblighter and Ezra L. Pyreborn -" Kagarn indicates the others - "have saved me from the machinations of the Jointrust, twice. As well as many of the other dangers of the road to the Zoram Strand."

Nerai looks back at the troll who just walked in. Her tools, which seem to creep into her hands whenever she's idle, slip back into her belt. "Ca-" She asks, looking at the troll. Fortunatly, before she can be too rude, Kagarn cuts her off. She smiles, and bows.

Saeren offers a polite nod to the troll. "As you can guess, Kagarn has been nothing but trouble for us," she deadpans.

Je'neu relaxes, and bows to Nerai with surprising grace for a troll. "Any friend of Kagarn's be a friend of mine," he says. A grin for Saeren, favoring her with his pointed tusks: "I hope he been more trouble to your enemies, me purple sistah." He sobers again. "Because we got plenty enemies here that need some trouble brought to 'em, true."

Nerai smiles at Je'neu. "It seems everyone has trouble around these times, yes?" She asks, the Goblin picking up maybe a little of his mode of speech

The troll shakes his head. "You don' know the half of it, li'l one." His eyes narrow. "Or p'raps ye do, an' that's why Kagarn brought yas." Je'neu paces around the hut. "The blasted Twilight's Hammer. I dunno whether they mad or stupid, but they in this one up to their eyebrows. Them an' their naga buddies." He turns to Kagarn. "And if that not be enough... have ye heard about what happen to the sea a couple weeks back?"

"No? Well, it be low tide one night, when I see the water creepin up the beach," says the troll. "Came up ten times faster 'n the tide, it did, an' it kept on comin. Got as high as the house poles afore it started comin down. I ask the water spirits, but all they say is they told to come forward outta the way, an' then they go back again." He shakes his head. "Weren't more'n a month after the naga start settin up shop up by the Zoram ruins. Gotta have somethin' ta do with their meddlin."

"The Twilight's Hammer have spoken of 'Dagun'. I gather this is the name - or their name - of the Old God which the naga are now worshipping. That is what ties them to the cult." Ezra gestures toward the sea with his cane. "The Forssaken have... their own motives for cooperating."

Je'neu nods to Ezra, his eyes narrowing. "I been wonderin what your people were up to over by Maestra," he says. "You have anythin' ta do with it?"

The wizard nods. "I am here to sstop them. To bring them back into .. the good graces of the Dark Lady, yess. Some have already eh, understood my goals here. The rest will need more perssuasion."

"I hope someone needs my kind of persuasion," says Saeren. After all, silence indicates consent. She's clearly getting restless. That murloc earlier served only to whet her appetite.

The troll grins at Ezra. "Is that so? Well, now that be a better story, mon." He looks north along the beach, toward the old night elf ruins. "The sea movin' worries me. The spirits don no nuffin. I sure the naga know somethin, but they not exactly comin to my hut to tell me da story."

"I think it's best for all of us that they don't get in a position where they have the freedom to do so," replies Saeren.

Nerai looks at the Troll. "So, have the Naga tries to kidnap any of the trolls or orcs?"

Je'neu shakes his head. "We don travel far from our village," he says. "Except for me, and they not catchin _me_ so easy. We fish fer our food. They want any o' us, they have to attack _here_, an' I be thinkin they don' have the numbers fer that."

Ezra nods. "That iss good then, yes. The elves.. have not been so lucky. The naga have a cursse which they can use to ensslave others. Do not accept a drink from their poissoned chalice, no."

Nerai nods at Ezra. "Death would probably be better then taking that drink...."

The troll looks grim. "That sound like them, true. They enslave the water spirits, twist 'em to their will." He turns to Kagarn. "I could use yer help, old friend," he says. "I _need_ ta know what wrong wit da sea. I can _make_ em tell me... if I gets em here. You think you can get me a naga to have a nice chat with?"

Saeren perks up at the mention of something to do. "That sounds like my kind of work. What kind of condition do you need this naga in? You need all its limbs on, or is merely ambulatory and able to communicate good enough?"

Je'neu laughs. "An elf after me own heart," he says. "No, I think I need all its limbs on, if you c'n manage it." He draws a dagger. "Hard f'r me to cut its fingers off one at a time if you already done gone and took 'em already, no?" Kagarn looks a little sick.

Saeren raises an eyebrow at Je'neu, "Well, I hate to see a talent like this go wasted. I think it's time to get to work."

Je'neu puts away the knife. "Sorry old friend," he says to Kagarn. "But I been wit de Darkspears since long before Thrall found us. Old habits be hard to break. An' sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do." He nods out the door of the hut. "There be plenty of naga up the beach. Too many, really. What you gotta do is, find some off by themselves. I need one o' the women. They be the ones wit de voodoo."

---

Now that she's been set loose, Saeren is all business. "We'll never find a solitary target. The naga aren't that stupid. Fortunately with so many things going their way, they are bound to be more than a little arrogant."

The first thing Saeren has to do is find the enemy. Fortunately there are a lot of naga. The night elf's plan is simple. She will go ahead and silently observe the enemy. Naga seem to have adapted the concept of patrols, and since they are intelligent, the patrols will be ordered and therefore predictable. It will take some time, but Saeren will learn where the patrols are headed and how many naga cluster in each patrol.

There are several very small patrols, but the naga seem to protect their women assiduously. The smallest patrol including a female is a group of six - a woman, evidently a magic user of some sort, with a hulking male naga and four spear-wielding murlocs as escorts. They patrol through a collection of night elf ruins along the beach, and there is a large boulder surrounded with weeds not far away, more than large enough to conceal Eecee's cart and the four ambushers.

Saeren is relieved to find something that can be managed. Still, taking out everyone except the magic user is generally not the safest way to win a fight. She sneaks away, conveying what she's seen to the others and getting everyone moving towards the attack site.

The ambushers spread out along the beach - Nerai positioning Eecee near the ruins so that she can get to grips with them quickly, with Saeren and Ezra lurking at some distance past the ruins, preparing to rain destruction on them from a distance. Kagarn takes up a position between them, prepared to heal either of his allies.

Not long after, the aquatic monstrosities come along the beach. They move slowly, with the massive male keeping close to his mistress' side, while the murlocs spread out in a diamond formation. All of them begin carefully peering behind pillars and fallen roofs as they move through the ruins, while also keeping an eagle eye on the scrub nearer to shore.

As the nearest murloc comes round a pillar, its eyes peer into the brush. Apparently, it spots a glint of metal - for it gargles an alarm to the others.

Ezra works up a spell, gesturing and muttering to himself, then slapping Saeren on the arm with a purple-charged hand. The elf feels herself growing lighter, able to soar through the clouds if she chose - or to evade the spears of the ground-bound murlocs.

Nerai runs at the large Naga thing, twirlling the morning star around her right hand as she goes. As she reaches toe to toe with the beast, she swings her spikey metal death over Eecee's head, planting the ball right in the thing's side.

The murloc gargles and rushes back around the pillar, following up with a swing of its trident. The attack makes a resounding CLANG and knocks away a few rivets from the steam armor, but the fine workmanship stands up to the blow.

Nerai may appear to be in serious trouble. To the ignorant naga and murlocs, anyway. While they move to flank the goblin, Saeren shoots these fish in a barrel. First two shafts leave a stunned murloc frozen forever with a gaping look of shock on its face and large burnmarks along its body. The corpse falls into the water with a loud splash. A flick of an eye later a third projectile slams into the murloc standing behind Eecee, drawing blood and searing flesh.

Kagarn rises from the brush and utters a supplication to the spirits of air, then levels his totem. A crackle of white and a smell of ozone, and the oversized naga male howls with rage as the lightning surges through him.

Now that the patrol is on the alert, they move to defend themselves more effectively. One of the murlocs at the rear, observing how relatively ineffectual its ally's trident is against Eecee's thick plate, circles around the pillars and heads off into the brush, its spear cocked as it seeks for a good shot at the rest of the party.

Ezra unloads a burning blast as his salvo, following up on Saeren's three-pronged archery attack. A bellowing firebolt streaks across the shore and strikes dead the hulking naga protector.

As the enormous naga falls, one of his murloc allies gargles with fear and rage. Setting its three-tined spear, it rushes at Eecee in a reckless charge, swinging wildly, only to have its attack bounce off the armor to no visible effect.

Meanwhile, its heavily wounded ally crawls up the beach, lurking behind a pillar to hide from the wrath of the vengeful night elf while watching for a chance to return the favor.

The naga sorceress hisses and begins to cast a spell. Kagarn steps up, his hands flaring green, and the sorceress rocks back, but maintains her concentration, sending a shimmering blue bolt back at Ezra - only to have the frigid blast sweep by, ineffectually.

Nerai lifts Eecee's arm, currently holding the long sword, high in the air, giving a primal goblin growl as the Large Naga .. thing.. before her falls to a flurry of lightning and fire. She lifts her morning star from the ground, ripping gruesomely from the lifeless chunk, and swings it across Eecee's body as she spins the source of Murloc death. The Spiked metal ball plants itself into the Murloc's ribcage, a crunch of bone sickeningly sounding across the field. She tries to bring her left arm down on the Murloc behind Eecee, now in Eecee's full field of view, but a slip at the last minute causes Eecee's arm to swing wide.

As the murloc steps away from Eecee's sword swing, it circles around, swinging its own trident and, if anything, proving even more ineffectual. Though, in truth, from the glances it's casting in the naga's direction, it doesn't seriously hope to damage the fighting machine - merely keep the thing away from its mistress.

Saeren sees the disabled murloc pull itself from the water, but for now ignores it. She has other fish to fry, as it were. Three shots, three hits, two more murloc fall in blasts of fiery death, and these show no signs of crawling about, barring divine or infernal intervention.

Kagarn's eyes narrow. They need to capture the naga female, so he is loath to use the full force of the elements on her. On the other hand... He holds up his totem and begins to chant. Nerai hears the sounds of battle dim for a moment, and then resume back to normal as the naga sorceress cringes back briefly, then laughs and utters a derisive remark in Nazja.

Even one of Ezra's less-poweful magics manages to set fire to a screaming murloc; fortunately the time between its arrival and the thing's demise is mercilfully swift. In kind, Ezra shouts back a disparaging remark in Nazja, suggesting the real use tridents have among naga women.

The naga hisses with rage and begins forming a reply of her own. This time, however, the Kagarn-guided intervention of the earth spirits is effective, and the spell dissipates in a burst of snow that flutters harmlessly to the ground in front of her. She screeches wildly, and utters a curse against all tauren everywhere.

Nerai quickly moves around the quarry, moving to get between her and the sea. She takes the long sord, and whaps the flat of the blade against the girl's head. The Naga looks a bit dizzy, but seems otherwise unharmed.

There is only one murloc left, and it is sorely wounded. Unable to effectively defend its mistress any longer, it limps toward the tauren with murder in its eyes, hoping for one last act of revenge.

The last murloc is put down with little fanfare. It's not like a crawling target is particularly evasive. Her attention shifts to the last target. She has come prepared, but needs a few more seconds to prepare her contribution to the final assault.

Kagarn narrows his eyes at the naga. Even with the power of the earth spirits at his aid, she is still a dangerous foe. And with the power she commands... He drops to one knee, holding out the totem, and begins to murmur quietly.

Nerai follows the naga as she tries to get away. Silly casters. As she gets done being pelted with Ezra's attack, Eecee butts the end of her sword against the naga's noggin.

Saeren watches Ezra and Eecee knock the naga for a bit and gets a bit bored. She fires off a few shots, and looks a bit surprised when the first hit puts the naga flat on her posterior. Or what would be a posterior if not for the tail.

Ezra begins walking toward the downed patrol. "Very very good," he mutters to himself, rubbing his bandaged hands together.

"Well, that was neat," says Saeren, walking up with Ezra. She looks over the harvest with a smile, "So we got.. a few goodies and a naga tart. I think Eecee should carry her."

Nerai says, "We should avoid dallying in our victory." Says Nerai, having Eecee pick up the now unconcious naga. She starts to carry the real prize over to the cart as the others scavange the battlefield. Uninterrupted, she will place the naga in the cart, and then tie her up. Just in case

Kagarn emerges from prayer, and laughs softly. "You are very effective at what you do, my friends," he says, as he helps strip the corpses of the naga caster's erstwhile protectors, as well as bind and gag the naga herself.

---

A bucket of water drenches the naga's face. "Rise an' shine, princess," says Je'neu. The naga hisses, and begins to speak, only to have the runes in the circle around her glow faintly. Je'neu grins as only a troll can. "Ya needn't bother, mon. We won't have any of yer voodoo here." He pulls out the dagger and steps forward. "Now I just gots a few questions for you, my dear."

"And then you'll let me go?" hisses the naga defiantly. "Ye know better'n that," replies Je'neu. "But I'll grant you a merciful death." He turns the dagger so that the light glints off the blade. "O'course, if you don't want to talk, I c'n be a lot less merciful."

The naga is stern of will, but the Darkspear trolls have a long and savage history, and though Thrall's coming laid a veneer of civilization on them, the barbarism is not too far away.

"I... I tell you... we had nothing to do with it," rasps the naga's voice, as her eyes watch Je'neu's dripping knife in horrified fascination. "It... was convenient for us... helped us move more of our war turtles up the beach... but we... we did not make the sea rise."

"If the Twilight's Hammer had called something forth that did it.. would you know about it?" Ezra asks.

"The Twilight's Hammer?" The naga laughs bitterly. "That bunch of self-important clowns. They couldn't make a wave in a swimming pool." She shakes her head slightly, groaning as she does so. "No... if... if they had _that_ kind of power... they wouldn't have come to _us_ for help."

The wizard hums. "Have you given them anything that might lead them to a ... stronger connection to Dagun?"

The naga's teeth glint in a cruel grin. "So you've learned that name, warmblood - _former_ warmblood," she corrects herself. "Oh, we've given them a few toys. Mostly, we've got them working in-" She trails off, only to yelp as Je'neu's knife moves. "In Blackfathom Deeps! We, we've got them working on a ritual in there."

Ezra nods. "Yes, yess. What ritualss?"

"Why, to summon one of Dagun's lesser servants. Aku'mai, the hydra goddess." The naga cackles. "When we complete that summoning, this precious village will be as dust!" Je'neu grimaces at the name.

"I ssee. And naturally, now that the Earthen Ring knows this.." The Forsaken spellcaster glances at the troll, then turns back to the naga. "Tell me ssomething, yess. You have all of the ocean. Only the Forssaken could conceivably intrude on your domain. Why this? Why now?"

"You have no understanding," says the naga. "We once ruled the whole world, before _her_ kind -" the naga glares hatefully at Saeren - "betrayed us, cast us into the ocean. But we found allies there, powerful allies. And with their help, when the time is right, we will take our rightful place once more." She glares at Je'neu. "And nothing you can do to _me_ will spare you warmbloods from your fate."

"Cry us a river," replies Saeren. "If your kind thought us cruel last time they are going to get an awakening such as no race has seen before."

Ezra has an epiphany. "Ahh!" he exclaims. "The Highborne. Of coursse... yesss."

The naga spits in Saeren's direction, but says nothing more to her. Instead she says to Je'neu, "What more do you want of me, warmblood?"

Ezra cackles. "Yes, yes, these ruins. Highborne.. the progenitor elvess... your ruins. Interessting.."

"Sso then. You control Dagun, or perhapss Dagun controlss you, yess." The wizard cracks his bony knuckles. "You sseduce the Forssaken with lies of shared power and the domination of the living, yess. For they most certainly are liess - you would not share your power and place, no. You mold that pathetic cult into a credible menace with promises of ancient slumbering powerss. But... that sstill does not answer my question." With eyes blazing, he looks at the naga. "Tell me, witch. Why _now_? The Horde and the Alliance both will oppose you. You had three decadess of open warfare on the ssurface, and centuries prior."

"Because... because the time is right," replies the naga. "Our plans of ten thousand years... they are finally coming to fruition." She utters a rasping laugh, and continues to boast. "And nothing your precious Horde _or_ Alliance can do will stand in ourway."

"Because you depended on Dagun's power, and Dagun would not - or could not - aid you until now," Ezra replies evenly. He's guessing, but he's most interested in the reactions that guess will provoke.

"Don't be a fool," she says. "Did you think... we would rely on mere mortal powers? That would lead to just another war... one we could not be sure of... winning. We _can_ be sure now," she grins, blood trickling from the corner of her jaw.

Ezra nods, and turns away. He glances at the troll. "Her usefulness is... at an end," he murmurs.

Saeren looks to Je'neu, "With your permission?"

"Only if ya make it quick an' painless," says Je'neu. "I promised her, an' I'm a troll o' my word."

"It will be as quick and painless as any way you might contrive," replies Saeren.

"You naga are supposedly so very intelligent, with a great store of knowledge," says Saeren. "It's all a farce. You're so idiotic that even now you cling to the promises of your war. Glory, power, revenge.." She draws an arrow and fits it to the string of her bow, raising the weapon. "But as you have sown, so shall ye reap. You wish for the only wages of war?" As she releases the string she whispers the last words the naga shall hear, "Then they are upon you." The arrow strikes home and after a spasm, the enemy grows still. "War brings death. Nothing more."
