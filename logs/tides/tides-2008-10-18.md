# Turning Tides 2008-10-18

After the corpse of the captured naga is removed from Je'neu's hut, he shoos everyone else away. As Ezra leaves, he notices Je'neu fetching earthenware jars from the shelves around the room and filling small braziers with the contents, before the door is shut. When asked about this, Kagarn explains, "It seems that Je'neu sees fit to commune with the spirits. Whatever methods you used to interrogate our captive - and the less you tell me of them, the happier will I be - they must have produced information we did not know."

Sure enough, smoke soon begins issuing from the chimney of Je'neu's hut, and those with a sense of smell who pass by the hut can confirm that whatever is being burned in there, it is not firewood. Several hours pass, and the smoke clears, before Je'neu emerges. "Da spirits have spoken, mon. Where is Kagarn? Where is de Forsaken mage? We got a lot to talk about."

Ezra has been working on scroll-crafting and muttering to himself. Upon hearing the summons, he rubs his hands together, folds up his parchments, and rises creakily to answer the call.

There is still a chalked circle on the floor - the symbols around it do not match anything Ezra has learned about, but there is a vague similarity to beckoning runes to them - and the scent of incense still lingers. Nevertheless, Je'neu seems to be reasonably clear-headed. "If dey be summoning Aku'mai, we not have much time," he says. "If Aku'mai be a servant of Dagun, her power is tied to the sea, an' to the tides. De best time to summon such a spirit be at the times o' highest tides, and that be at de new moon an' de full moon."

Kagarn's craggy brow creases. "The new moon is but three days away," says the tauren, to which Je'neu nods. "Yes. An' de new moon be better for 'em anyhow, cos de moon goddess not be watchin' em."

"We musst make that power our own," the mage mutters, eyeing the symbols carefully. "Not to usse, no. To ssomehow thwart the naga."

There is a silence. The two shamen turn to Ezra. "Be you mad?" says Je'neu. "Dis be a servant o' the _Old Gods_ we talkin about, mon. Dey not let you use dere power wit'out payin a price..."

"Neverthelesss," hisses Ezra. "Our weaponss against a being of surpasssing power musst be such... things. We must presserve the world, yes? Is that not what your order sstruggles to do?"

Je'neu gets up and paces the floor. "De Earthen Ring... our role is to keep de elements in balance. De elemental spirits... dey be a part of nature. But dey be wild, if you let 'em have dere head, dey burn de world, or blow it down, or bury it-" He gestures toward the sea. "Or flood it. An' Aku'mai... she not be an elemental. She be one that _abuses_ de elements, lets 'em do what dey please. How you plan to use a power like dat?"

"I won't know for sure until I have it, yess." The mage paces within the narrow confines of the other's hut. "Ssomething, some power in the chalices, taints those who drink from them. Ssome power causes a fountain to bursst forth within a Titan ruin. The arcane runs through the veins of Azeroth like blood, yess. And if we can draw _this_ blood out, well... there are purposes it may be put to, I am sure."

Kagarn peers at the mage. "Ezra, surely you do not intend to summon Aku'mai yourself? I assure you, we cannot-" But Je'neu holds up a hand to interrupt. "Wait. I tink I see what he gettin' at. He sayin we can _sacrifice_ Aku'mai, steal her power from her. Like how we Darkspear used ta eat de hearts of our enemies."

Ezra nods. "Jusst so."

Je'neu grins. "Hm. I _like_ dis idea. Cos to bring Aku'mai fully into da world, de spirits say you need a sacrifice o' yer own. De life o' someone pure o' heart. If you c'n get 'em to start de ceremony, den stop 'em from sacrificin' _their_ victim... you c'n turn de tables on 'em." He rubs his chin. "O' course, even a weakened Aku'mai ain't nothin ta sneeze at."

Ezra sniffs. "We are not without some degree of effectiveness....and the elves of Maesstra's Posst may be...encouraged to assist, yes." He focuses his gaze on the troll. "Alliance and Horde musst fight together against this menace."

Kagarn nods. "The elves, yes. Ezra and I have seen how many naga populate the ruins of Zoram Strand. We will _need_ the help of the night elves, whether our goal is to stop the summoning of Aku'mai or to subvert it. They must occupy the bulk of the Old Gods' forces, while a small but potent group infiltrates the temple itself." He grins, showing his own broad teeth. "And I cannot think of a group better qualified than ours."

"There iss no one else," Ezra murmurs. "Not in three dayss' time, no. We must act now."

Je'neu rises. "I must talk to de chieftain," he says. "De night elf emissary needs to take a message back. If he can get people for our own attack, so much de better. If not, de elves will have to do it demselves." He opens the door to the hut. "Kagarn, Ezra... you go talk to de other two. I be comin wit' you dis time."

---

Je'neu is highly respected in Zoram'gar. It does not take him long to convince the chieftain of a dire threat to the outpost, one that will require all the orcs and trolls he can spare in an attack on the naga. The Maestra emissary sets out in the morning, this time with an honor guard of three orcs, and a promise that a larger force will support the night elves in their attack.

On the afternoon of the new moon, at the ebb of the tide, the adventurers set out with the Zoram'gar expeditionary force. The trolls are fearsome in their war paint, and the orcs give them a run for their money with the ferocity of their battle chants. Both races have a long history of war, and the present peace has settled uneasily with them; a chance for an honest and righteous war against a worthy foe is a godsend to them.

Just before they reach the battlefield, Je'neu guides his party on a different path. "I know dis land," he says. "We can see de battle start from here. When we have a chance, we move." He looks at Nerai. "You be wanting to start yer war machine den, if yer takin it," he says. "We not gettin' yer mules down into de temple, an' I assure you de naga ain't gonna notice the noise none. They be too busy makin noise o' their own."

Nerai nods to the Troll, and climbs up into Eecee, working about in the cockpit to start him up.

It doesn't take long to reach Je'neu's vantage point, which, as promised, provides ample cover from the woods while still giving a good view of the naga-infested beach.

Even harder to miss is the moment when the combined forces of Alliance and Horde charge down the beach, their war cries seemingly audible for miles. Moonfire and tangling brambles erupt amongst the naga forces, and bolts of chilling ice flash back, before the orcish axemen charge in amongst the murlocs, while sentinel archers trade fire with naga crossbows. The battle for Silverwind Refuge was a minor skirmish by comparison.

Saeren restlessly grips her bow, glaring at Je'neu. She's already been warned that she cannot fire yet, but the hunger for the kill burns bright in her eyes. Her rage, for the moment, is a firmly leashed monster.

But Je'neu is not watching the chaos. Instead, he is watching an unassuming ruin, seemingly little different from the others. And when he sees its defenders move off to join the fray, only then does he leap to his broad feet. "Let's go!" cries the troll. "Saeren, only shoot 'em if they see us!"

Ezra rises from his prone position, but stays crouched. His black coat and hat are wrapped tightly about him, concealing the white of his bandages. His cane is held defensively, ready to strike if necessary, more likely ready to assist him in the gestures of spellcasting.

Nerai pushes the buttons, her feet working the levers to makes eecee, rather nosily I might add, follow the Troll over to the ruin.

Saeren keeps a keen eye on the enemy as she charges at the head of the group, an arrow already nocked. She murmurs softly, "Come on, Naga.. see me. See me. I dare you."

There is no challenge; the distraction has done its work effectively. Je'neu leads them into the mouth of an abandoned temple, and hurtles down a staircase inside the ruin which spirals deep into the structure, coming to a halt at the bottom, where a seemingly natural tunnel goes deeper into the rock beneath the beach. "Blackfathom Deeps," breathes Je'neu. "Keep on yer guard; dey'll have more down here..."

The caves are dank, and the stone is dark. There is only the light that the adventurers brought with them, and in the gloom, water drips from seaweed that hangs from the ceiling. They look as if they should be quiet, were it not for the whirring of Eecee and the clatter of its feet on the ground.

Je'neu halts behind them. "Go on ahead," he says. "I need ta set a guard. We need ta make sure de naga don't come back an' surprise us." He turns back toward the entrance, and lays his hands on the wall, murmuring a prayer to the spirits. After a few seconds, there is a faint rumbling audible from the walls...

And immediately after, the gargle of a murloc, from further down the corridor.

"Ah, good, I was about to say I was bored," whispers Saeren. She looks down the corridor, hungry for the fight.

A small party of murlocs and naga has come around the corner and spotted the adventurers. One of the murlocs rushes forward and hurls a spear. Instead of bouncing off Eecee as such attacks usually do, the spear manages to slip between two plates and catch in one crucial joint. There is a whir and a crash as the spinning gears beneath snap off the head of the spear, and there is a worrying grinding sound coming from inside the machine.

Nerai runs up to the Murloc in question, Eecee's large metal frame and large claw-like feet poinding the rock of the ruin as she closes the distance to the fichy creature. As she gets in range, the morning star flail, she pulls the flail back. Unfortunatly, the spear that got lodge in the worm gear for the shoulder. She pushes the lever, and crunches the gears through the spear, but her opportunity to attack is lost.

Two more murlocs rush forward, one flinging a spear, the other swinging a gleaming trident against Eecee's metal hide. The spear falls short, though, and the tines of the trident glance off the steel to no effect.

Kagarn runs forward. "We must protect Je'neu until his spell is complete!" he declares, stopping behind Eecee, and pulling forth a wooden shaft, which he throws to the ground. The wood seems to penetrate straight into the solid rock, and begins to glow a soft green. Earthen tentacles spiral up from the ground and clutch at the nearest enemies; they manage to avoid the grasp of Kagarn's totem, but the tendrils of stone pursue them, trying to drag them down.

Three more murlocs join in the attack, staying clear of the stony tentacles and pelting Kagarn with spears from a distance. Two of them miss, or are deflected by a waving column of stone, but the third strikes him in the shoulder. He grunts and snaps the spear off at the haft.

Saeren glares at the naga sorceress, looking past the others. In the blink of an eye she's fired three times, the first two slamming into the enemy and putting her on the very door of death. The last, however, is ill-guided, and the enemy just barely avoids her doom.

Darts of purple mage-fire burst from Ezra's hand as he comes round the corner, striking true against the four murlocs clustered behind the massive myrmidon. But they don't stop there - the missiles strike through the squealing fish-creatures and converge on their naga master.

The naga mage, arrows smoldering in her flesh, glares at the hated night elf, and raises her hands. "You will decorate my chamber-" she begins to call, in Nazja - only to rock backward as Kagarn raises his hand in a now-familiar gesture, and all Saeren feels is a brief, chilly breeze as her spell dissipates in a string of Nazja curses.

Meanwhile, the giant naga in the foreground raises his massive axe, and brings it down toward the intrepid goblin warrior. But the effort of avoiding Kagarn's tentacles distracts his blow just long enough for Nerai to stomp on one of the pedals and dodge the steam armor nimbly out of the way.

As the battle rages, another enormous naga male appears around the corner, his axe at the ready. He advances past his mistress, preparing to slither through the murloc minions between him and his foes. As he does so, one of said minions steps nimbly around Eecee and takes a swing at the tauren, who nimbly steps back away from the blow.

Nerai guides Eecee through the gap between the Murlocks, moving to surround herself with lots and lots of fishy death soon enough, as she's passing, she swings the Morning Star across, gashing at the Murlock's shoulder. Unfortunately, a slight misstep as she turns her back to the cavern wall to fight, causes the sword to miss the Murloc high.

The murloc that suffered the blow from the morning star swings its trident vengefully, but cannot hit the deftly maneuevered steam armor. One of the murloc spearmen in the back is more lucky, successfully striking the tauren with a second blow.

Kagarn steps back, dodging away from the murloc with its trident, and calls forth the power of the spirits to knit his wounds. Meanwhile, the writhing stone finally manages to ensnare one of the murlocs and the giant naga, hindering their movements.

Still standing clear of the totem's tentacles, the murlocs in the rear unleash another fusillade of spears, one of them managing a lucky hit on the shaman.

Saeren feels that breeze and smiles. "Thanks Kagarn!" she calls out. Now it's time to finish the act. "You'll make a nice pair of boots, Naga," mutters Saeren. Three more arrows fly, two find the target, and the sorceress falls into a thrashing heap, drawing still moments later.

With a few croaked syllables and an upward thrusting motion with splayed fingertips, Ezra conjures up a deadly cage of sharpened icy razors in the middle of the pack of murlocs. Those nearest the center die horribly, while the hardier myrmidons merely suffer.

Barely caught in the backwash of Ezra's icy attack, the nearer giant naga howls with rage and swings at Eecee with his enormous axe. The murloc behind Eecee serves as a useful distraction for his attack - but unfortunately, Kagarn's Earthbind totem distracts him in turn, and the heavy blow manages to glance off the side of the armor.

One of the surviving murlocs tries to get past Eecee, but thanks to the earthen distraction, Eecee gets the opportunity to lay into it with the morning star. Rocked by the blow, the murloc swings back in revenge, managing to gouge a small but noticeable tear in the steam armor.

Nerai backs Eecee's back to the wall, trying to make sure they don't' get behind her. Not that fighting a few on each side is any easier. She swings the trusty morning star at the Murloc on her far right, gashing a chunk of it's hip. The second one, still dancing away from Eecee through the earthbind, manages to slip under Eecee's sword. Cruddy balance on the blade. That's go to be it.

Gargling in pain, the murloc stabs its trident forward wildly. The blow connects solidly, but the thick metal of Eecee means that the only effect of the attack is to bend the trident's tines slightly. The murloc hops back, shaking its arms frantically.

Saeren again shoots in rapid succession, the first dart soaring towards a naga warrior. Even with a strong shot it merely glances off, and she changes her target quickly. Two arrows empty into the nearest murloc, leaving it in a smouldering pile on the ground.

More arcane missiles dart from the wizard's fingers. Ezra guides them skillfully to smash into the hulking naga. One wobbles, while the other falls down.

But the collapsed naga staggers up onto its tail again, its movements sluggis as the magic has battered it. Its giant axe comes down again, and despite its wounds, the naga manages to score a solid hit on Eecee, gouging the deepest hole yet in the armor.

Nerai gets a bit shakes as the Myrmidon's start to hack through Eecee's armor as if it were tissue paper. She sees red, forgetting her combat training she flails wildly at the opponents all around her. Obviously, such untuned attacks miss widely, even against opponents with their bodies already rent by magical attacks.

Despite its bleeding wounds and battered limbs, the sole surviving murloc has some fight in it yet. Another swing of the trident, and it manages to widen the hole left by its naga ally, exposing a bit more of the whirring cogs and drive-belts beneath.

Kagarn raises his hand once more - lightning flashes from his outstretched fingertips and grounds itself in the murloc's flesh. The murloc falls to the ground, twitching as the last lightnings arc over its body.

Though the enemies are mostly dead, Saeren sees no lack of danger. Three more times her bow sings, but only the first arrow strikes home, leaving an already badly wounded naga flat on its back.

Ezra finishes the task at hand with another round of arcane missiles, slaying the myrmidon. As the bulk crashes to the ground, he cricks his neck and chitters, satisfied.

Behind them, Je'neu finishes his chanting, and the rumbling earth reaches a fever pitch. Three earth elementals, each as big as Je'neu, emerge from the tunnel walls. Je'neu orders them to keep watch over the tunnel entrance and prevent anyone from entering until he gives the word. Their glowing yellow eyes regard Je'neu dispassionately, and then they nod their stony heads and turn away, seemingly as immovable as the tunnel walls themselves.

The troll turns back to the party, looking somewhat weary. "There. Now we not be havin' any more interruptions..." he begins, then looks down the hall at the murloc and naga corpses strewn along it. He whistles appreciatively. "By earth an' fire, you done had a busy time of it yourself, non?"

"I think Nerai had most of the fun," says Saeren. "I don't think we've seen the end of them, either."

Nerai is more or less beside herself with all of the damage Eecee has taken. She's literally trembling with rage inside of her cockpit. She looks out at her other teammates, looking down at the almost fully sundered armor.

"We do have something to fix the armor, right?" asks Saeren. "If we meet anything stronger than a starved murloc we're going to need Eecee in good condition."

"I c'n take care of that, sure," says Je'neu. "If da machinery itself had got torn up much, you'd hafta handle it, but this be just torn metal. And metal comes from the earth..." The troll puts his hands to the torn metal, and it begins to roll back before Nerai's eyes.

Nerai practically jumps in the cockpit as the troll starts to cast on it. "Hey-" She begins, but she stops as she sees the damage fixing itself. "That's great!" She cries out, so happy, she fmings her, that is, Eecee's arms wide, to try and hug the troll!

"Careful, mon, careful," says Je'neu, backing up and chuckling. "Watch dat huge ol' mace o' yours. I don' want me head smashed in cos you're happy." But the old shaman doesn't look too worried about it.

"Well, guess that handles that." Saeren looks deeper into the tunnels, "On we go then."

Je'neu nods. "Ya. We still got a few hours, an' we have ta get to the ritual chamber 'fore they start. The one thing we can't do is let anyone sound de alarm." The troll lopes along the tunnel, his sharp eyes peering into the gloom.
