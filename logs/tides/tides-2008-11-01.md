# Turning Tides 2008-11-01

As the adventurers plunge deeper into the bowels of Blackfathom Deeps, the dampness seems to increase, the very air clinging to their skin and trying to drain their warmth - those that have it to drain, at least. "This is not natural," rumbles Kagarn, to which Je'neu nods. "Yah. Water be runnin' way outa control."

As the sensation increases, the two night elves the party had rescued, already weary from their ordeal, begin to stumble. Je'neu's pace slows to match. "I take care of dese two," he says, waving the rest of the party ahead. "You gotta stop de ritual quickly. I catch up, help wit de binding, but you gotta stop dem before Aku'mai get too strong."

In response, Ezra tips his hat politely. "Take care," he murmurs.

The rest of the party continues, ducking under overhanging curtains of seaweed, avoiding slippery patches of moss on the stone. Suddenly, raw stone gives way to polished marble, and the stone around them is, if not squared, clearly more regular. And the sound of chanting in Nazja is audible up ahead.

Nerai looks over at the forsaken and the night elf. She doesn't understand the Naga language anyway. Her hands are off the controls, trying to keep Eecee as quiet as possible; Still a pretty hard task, given he's still running.

"Closer, yes," murmurs Ezra, pulling his hat down over his eyes. He grips his cane warily, stepping as lightly as possible on the flat stone underfoot.

Her friends are roughly as quiet as a cave-in, to Saeren's ears. "There's only one thing to do about it in the end." She already has an arrow fitted to the string.

Suddenly, as the party rounds a corner, the tunnel gives way to a vast chasm, lit with glowing braziers framing a stone altar - and more importantly, lit by an enormous fountain of brightly glowing green water at the far end of the room. The light flickers over the underground lake and glistens on the limestone stalagmites that protrude from the rippling waves.

At the altar in the foreground, facing away from the party, is a female naga holding an enormous trident. As Ezra draws closer, he can hear more clearly; the chant is an invocation to Aku'mai, singing the praises of the kraken goddess and promising that blood will run like her holy water over the land... starting with the blood of _this_ being.

Surrounding the altar are a small pack of murlocs, each holding wooden spears of their own. And in the distance, inside the green fountain... they can see a marble dais, on which is perched another naga. At least, it once may have been a naga. It still retains the naga's serpentine form, but the face has partially transformed from the alien beauty of a naga woman to something more reptilian, her arms have grown enormous and clawed, and there are bulges at her flanks which presage the eruption of limbs. The enormous apparition has all four arms raised in supplication, and she is replying to the naga at the altar, with a voice that is no longer quite the melodic if shrill voice of a naga siren. Something raspy, something _alien_, is in her voice, and it grows stronger by the moment.

There is just enough time to take in the tableau before one of the murlocs glances down the corridor. It gargles a warning in Nerglish - "Intruders! The deadly ones! Mistress, beware!" - and its companions snap into watchfulness.

The murlocs rush into the corridor and size up the opposition. In the lead are a metal monstrosity and a rather less heavily armored night elf; with their light spears, they judge the latter to be the easier target. They do not reckon on Saeren's agility, though, and none of the spears find their mark, although one comes uncomfortably close.

Saeren watches the attacks of the murlocs fly past with a glare. The hatred burning in her eyes is almost weapon enough. Three shots, all strike the filth arrayed against her, leaving one seriously wounded and graduated in stature from murloc to carcass.

Nerai revs Eecee up into high gear, running at the Murlocs, she swings her weapons wildly ass she pulls p, but misses each time, the ball and blade of death swiping over the Murloc's heads.

The priestess looks around from the altar, and utters a cry of rage at seeing one of her minions already down. She turns from her ritual and begins a new incantation; Kagarn tries to interrupt her, but he fails, and a bluish-green aura sounds the naga.

"NO!" echoes a voice through the cavern, and the water column subsides somewhat. "Deal with them quickly! The ritual must be completed!" The apparition at the far end of the cavern has ceased to grow, though the uncanny green light still plays over its features.

All of Ezra's well-concealed rage bubbles forth as he raises both hands above his head and begins to draw them down, aiming at the ranting naga priestess. His fingers move quickly, darting this way and that to draw out lattices of fiery magical force. "Gensa Reth!" he shouts, releasing a powerful firebolt that flies past the surprised murlocs and simply slays the priestess outright.

The tauren shaman moves to Saeren's side, his totem clasped firmly in one hand. "You balance out the element of water most effectively, mage," he comments. "But be ready. If we are to do what you intend, we must neutralize the avatar itself."

"This was a fraction of my power," mutters Ezra.

The murlocs gargle in rage as their mistress falls, and swarm around Eecee, prodding at the war machine ineffectually with their spears.

Watching the enemies behave as the primitive little filth they are only increases the night elf's equally primal rage. She fires two more successful attacks into their ranks, leaving another smoldering corpse.

Nerai turns to the Murlocs as they surround her in Eecee. She widens her stands, and brings both the weapons she wields down over the head of the unfortunate Murloc that Saeren just pegged. The warblade falls errant to one side, while the flail makes a solid contact, crashing the Murloc into the ground.

"Fools!" cries the nascent avatar of Aku'mai, as the curtain of water dissipates, though the uncanny glow around the dais persists. "Must I do everything myself!" The naga-hydra monstrosity leaps from its perch and plunges into the water, quickly disappearing in the murky froth. The water ripples briefly where the creature went in, then goes quiescent.

Moving forward, Ezra approaches Eecee, mindful of the remaining murloc. As he moves, he chants the rituals of sacred fire that call and bind an elemental of fire to his service.

Kagarn nods approvingly at the fiery apparition that Ezra calls forth. "Truly a fitting opponent for the water that would engulf us," he remarks, and rests his hands on Saeren's shoulders. He begins to speak words that Saeren cannot understand, but inspire a battle lust in her beyond even her normal simmering rage.

Now hopelessly outnumbered, the remaining murloc turns and flees, avoiding Eecee's morningstar and diving into the water.

Saeren's enhanced thirst for the blood of her enemies has an immediate effect. She steps to the side as the enemy attempts to flee. To her, his attempts to hide are roughly as effective as waving his hands while standing by a campfire. Three shots leaves behind a boiling blob of fishmass bobbing in the chill water.

Nerai looks to her companions, "Any ideas?" She asks, of anyone who is close by and listening. She runs up to the alter, and stands Eecee atop it, looking into the water, trying to see what she can see. This is mostly just the Murloc pincushion.

As Nerai approaches the altar, she sees the sacrificial victim. It is indeed a blue-skinned creature, female, clad in white robes, gagged, and bound hand and hoof. The white robes are stained red around the belly, in three places along a line, matching the spacing of the naga's trident. Instead of hair, her skull is covered with an articulated bony plate, and her eyes are a lambent yellow as she looks up at Nerai, her face showing an expression of mingled hope and bewilderment.

What Nerai does not see is the avatar of Aku'mai - at least, until it is too late. Suddenly the serpentine form rears out of the water and hisses at the steam armor. It makes a complicated gesture, and a ball of super-frozen ice flashes through the air, crashing into Eecee. There is a shrieking sound as the armor's metal rapidly shrinks.

Moving forward, the Forsaken mage approaches Eecee. As he moves, his fire elemental rushes to trade inconclusive blows with the avatar - fire and water produce nothing but a little steam. Ezra's own flame magic fares little better.

Kagarn rushes into the tunnel mouth, and glares at the apparition. "Aku'mai! Your spirit will be ours!" he bellows, raising his staff in challenge.

Saeren moves like a rushing gale, charging past Kagarn and towards the altar. Perhaps her surprise at the one on top of it draws her attention too greatly, as the arrow goes wide. She speaks to the strange woman at the altar, "Are you alright?"

Nerai waves to the creature, obviously female, laying on the alter. "Don't worry." She flashes a smile to the 'thing' before she runs over to the avatar. Seeing the elemental's tactic, she stands on the other end, surrounding the large beast. She swings her Flail as she runs, slamming the spiked ball into the creature's underbelly. The spiked weapon impales itself into the creature's belly.

Roaring with rage as Eecee's morningstar connects, the creature whirls and turns on the fighting machine, grabbing it in her four clawed arms. The enormous creature strugges, but Eecee's artificially enhanced strength is enough to fend off the attempt.

While his elemental slams its fiery body into the wounded Aku'mai avatar, Ezra himself brings forth another firebolt and sends it hurtling at the creature. The avatar, unable to evade due to its wrestling with Nerai's mechanical marvel, receives the full brunt of the attack. The wizard himself, now positioned directly behind Eecee, has already started to chant another spell.

Kagarn nods in acknowledgment, and raises his totem high above his head. "Lightning hear my call!" he calls out in Taur-ahe, and the spirits answer, lighting the cavern with an echoing lightning strike. The avatar howls, "NOOOO! So... close..." and collapses to the cavern floor, still twitching slightly as little arcs crawl over its body.

The tauren wastes no time, but runs forward, grabbing the dead creature under one arm. "Come, Nerai. Help me drag this thing into the circle. We must act now to turn the spell against itself."

Nerai pulls Eecee's arms under the avatar's armpits, and begins to drag the thing over to the circle scribed in the floor.

Saeren's bloodlust is still firing, but seeing something she's never encountered before sparks something that rarely surfaces in the nigh soulless elf: curiosity. She moves a little closer to the creature on the altar, "You are safe now. We'll be getting out of here soon. Where are you from? I don't know if you have a clue what I'm saying." In any case, Saeren scoops up the stranger and carries her away from the circle.

"Remove the ssacrifice, yesss.." Ezra hobbles away from the water's edge, silently directing his elemental to guard the entrance way against murlocs or naga. He crouches down beside the ritual circle, glowing eyes regarding the scene, but remains silent.

Once the avatar's corpse has been moved into the circle, Eecee will move the priestess out of the was as well, dragging her off to one side. Nerai's head perks up as she hears her native tongue. She glares at Saeren, then relaxes just a bit, piloting Eecee to stand close to the elemental.

Kagarn nods to Ezra. "We must begin our own ritual. You know the manner of summoning fire elementals and binding them to your will. Do you know likewise of water elementals?"

"All four elements obey my call, yess," the wizard replies, eyeing the avatar. "Although the use of that power is now denied me until dawn."

"This spell is similar, but not the same," replies Kagarn. "Je'neu explained it to me. The goddess Aku'mai is not an elemental, but she comes from the elemental plane of water. She has been summoned already, so you need not open a link to that plane; instead, you must engage in the ritual of binding." The tauren takes up a place around the circle. "But be warned! Her will is far stronger than any elemental. You must use all your wits and knowledge to resist her attempts to break free in turn. If we fail, her spirit will escape." He raises his hands. "Are you ready? We need but hold her until Je'neu arrives."

Ezra cracks the bones of his fingers together. "If I am not, we will ssoon know. Let uss begin."

As Kagarn and Ezra begin to invoke their respective powers, the circle glows a vivid scarlet, and the avatar's body begins to burn with green flame. And the flames form the shape of a many-headed hydra, and there is a raspy voice that seems to bypass the ears and whisper into the very mind. "What are... No! No, you cannot! You cannot do this!" As Aku'mai's voice whispers, Ezra feels his will weakening, and the green flames rise higher.

Without a fair amount of his magical energies, Ezra feels enervated. But this doesn't last for long. Bending his mind to the task at hand, he summons the same reservoir of indomitable refusal that has sustained his sanity as one of the Forsaken. "No. No, you will _not leave_," he grates out. "You belong to ussss...."

The Forsaken mage redoubles his efforts, and the circle's red glow brightens. The flames begin to subside again, begin to lift away from the corpse. "No! This cannot be! I am... I am the will of Aku'mai! No mortal mage can control me!" But there is a hint of desperation in its voice.

The mage makes ritual beckoning motions, channeling the currents of arcane energy that continuously flow through his body, drawing them into harmony with the ritual as it stood, mastering the spell and bolstering it with the years of wizardly study he performed. In his mind are two forces: the essence of Aku'mai, and a woman's smiling face. "Do not call me mortal," he hisses.

"Impossible!" screeches the alien voice, but the voice is feeble now, and the green flames draw away from the avatar entirely and collapse into a glowing ball hovering above the center of the circle. "Too... weak... if only... they had held out longer. Dagun, avenge meeeeeeee..." The voice trails off in a high-pitched whine, and is silent.

"Wow, you guys done good," calls Je'neu's voice from the door, the two night elves resting in the corridor. "Looks like all I got ta do is finish up." He lopes toward the altar, and sets a brass vessel on it, then takes up a third position around the circle and begins to chant.

Ezra can feel Je'neu's spirit - fiery and hot - wrap itself around the glowing sphere of Aku'mai's essence and drag it slowly, inexorably, toward the jar. "Unhand meee..." whispers the voice of Aku'mai, defiant yet pitifully weak, as the green sphere floats through the air, until it lands in the jar. There is a splash, as it hits the water that fills the jar, and the green shifts from a sickly, diseased shade to the verdant green of the deep woods, then to a brilliant white. Je'neu reaches over and flips the lid closed. "We got her."

Ezra rises from his crouch. "Very well," the mage murmurs. "And now.. to find out how many were slain for this, yess."

Saeren looks down to her rather quiet ward and says, "Can one of you spare a moment to make sure she's okay before the post victory mop-up?"

Saeren's attempts to interrogate the blue-skinned woman, meanwhile, are less than fruitful. The woman doesn't appear to know any language that Saeren knows, though she recoils from Nazja in fear.

Ezra tries a few simple phrases in Kalimag and other, more obscure tongues. If the creature isn't an eredar, perhaps she instead knows the language of the elementals.

The woman's eyes light up at Kalimag, though her own replies are halting. "I... not suprised a mage know elemental words," she says, her own Kalimag slow and heavily accented. "I not speak well, but I know what mean."

"We will protect you. We must leave." Ezra nods to the others, reverting to the more familiar tongues of Azeroth. "We'll speak more later, but for now we should... reconvene somewhere."

"Strange that dead person protect me from fish creatures," says the woman. "But you stop that," she says, nodding to the corpse of Aku'mai's avatar. "That is good." She gets up, her movement greatly eased as Kagarn and Je'neu lend their strength - an action which seems to invoke surprise. "You two... speak to spirits," she says, appearing delighted. "We have people... would talk to you."

---

The return trip is relatively uneventful; the disruption of the summoning of Aku'mai seems to have aroused the elements. Though naga and murlocs still prowl the caverns, along with the many races of the Twilight's Hammer, they seem more than occupied fighting elementals that have turned against them, leaving the adventurers unmolested.

Even though the enemy is, for now thwarted, Ezra indicates that he'd like to bring a murloc out. After Saeren puts an arrow through the eyes of one he reiterates that the murloc must be alive. Fortunately, Saeren has one all but run right into her arms. Stabbing an arrow neatly through both of its shoulders brings it to the ground in a still-living state. A bit of rope work and the archer is proudly dragging an only mostly-dead murloc behind her. And taking care to strike it roughly on every rock she passes.

They reach the entrance just as the last of Je'neu's guardian elementals falls to a naga axe. The naga glares at the party, and raises his axe to charge - only to fall to an arrow from behind. "There you are!" calls a night elf voice from beyond the tunnel. "They've been trying to get in here for hours. Did you succeed?"

"Aku'mai is ours," Ezra replies curtly.

"That explains it," says the sentinel, gesturing toward the stairs. "The naga lines suddenly broke twenty minutes ago, and we've been advancing ever since. We're mopping up now. Come on, let's return."

The elf pauses, then turns back, staring openly at the blue woman. "What in Elune's name... who is this? Where did she come from??"

Ezra repeats the question in Kalimag, translating replies for the benefit of all.

"I come... from far off world. We called it..." The woman pauses, looking for the words. "It mean 'place of exile'. In our language, we call it Draenor."

Nerai perks up at the homeworld name. Goblins have light lore of many things, and the name is immediately familiar.

"The orc homeworld." Ezra nods in recognition. "So you came through the portal?"

"Orcs!" The woman snaps to attention, and then begins speaking rapidly in her native tongue. The language is similar to Eredun, but where the language of demons tugs at sanity and morals even to listen to, the rolling syllables are musical and flowing. The effect in _this_ case, however, is of righteous anger; there is something about cursing that transcends language barriers.

Ezra gets the gist of it. "Things... have changed. You must see for yourself," he says finally. "Your name?"

"You say? They have change? The orcs have forget their madness?" The woman looks skeptical. "My name... Drusilla."

"Not forgotten.. Conquered." Ezra smiles. "Yes, I am dead. My people ally with Warchief Thrall of the Horde. An orc. These - Saeren, Nerai - are of other people, who do not. But we work together against the naga."

Nerai nods to Drusilla as she is introduced. Given as she's still in Eecee, Eecee bows too.

The woman nods. "Orcs kill my mother and father, but naga kill my brother and sister."

"We, together, must stop them," Ezra says. "We must find any of you that still live and warn them. Will you help us?"

"Many of our people live," she says. "We land on this world on island far to west. I captured from there, dragged beneath waves."

The discussion continues in this halting vein, as they make their way back along the beach, stopping in the night elf camp. The night elves are elated that two of their number have been returned safely, and they are all equally curious about the newcomer, though none of them have much better luck in speaking to her.

Je'neu, meanwhile, is quite happy with the prize they had won from Blackfathom Deeps, though Kagarn is still doubtful. "You done good, Ezra," he says. "We make something right proper to fight naga with, you'll see. Or maybe you help? I tink you the sort who like to help. I could use your kinda help."
