The Master's Glaive looms up before them, an enormous polearm driven through a giant, petrified skull. The skull is cracked where the weapon is driven in, and it seems _wrong_, somehow - misshapen and unnatural. The entire area seems to be bathed in a soft light that buoys the spirits of the party as they approach - even Ezra.

As they draw even nearer, though, there is something more unsettling - a glowing violet magic circle etched into the ground that is growing dimmer even as they watch. Near one side of the circle, between two of the foul-smelling candles at the corners, is a lectern with an open book resting on it.

Ezra warily avoids the circle, moving with intent to inspect the book.

Nerai looks around a bit. "You'd think we'd see some people here..."

The text in the open book is moving even before his gaze - though not in themind-twisting manner of the more sinister of grimoires. Rather, his impression is that the text he is seeing was present only due to a magical effect which is now fading. Even as he watches, the text evens out to mere wavy lines upon the page.

"You would have, a moment ago," says Saeren. She bends down to look over the ground, where she can see signs of recent movement. "I wonder what they were doing here." She does not move, her attention focused as she tries to determine numbers and identity from the evidence around her.

After studying the tracks, Saeren concludes that there were about a dozen people here shortly. Their tracks do not lead off in any direction, but instead cluster around the circle.

Ezra considers the magic present, then reaches out and carefully closes the book before lifting it up to take possession. "Ssomething ssummoned here, recently. Perhapss the demonss we fought, yes. Perhapss something.... elsse," he says after a moment's consideration.

Nerai itches the back of one of her hands, "I don't like it..." She peers around.. "I can't believe they just... disappeared."

Ezra thinks. "Or perhapss.... a portal. A gateway to ssomewhere?"

"It's not _where_, it's _when_," comes a gnomish voice behind them. "Hi Ezra, Saeren, Nerai. You're just in time."

Saeren's arrow is fitted to the string and drawn back, but she does not fire. "In time for what?"

Nerai wheels the armor around, and looks.

As they turn, a female gnome is hopping over a log. Her hair is short and pale blonde, and she is wearing white painted armor with no visible device. "In time to follow them, of course," she says. "Glad to see you guys again, by the way."

Ezra stares coldly. "We have not met before," he says at last. "What iss your business with us?"

Nerai looks the gnome over, "Again? You must be funning us...."

Saeren lowers her bow slowly, but she does not release the tension on the string just yet. She doesn't recognize this gnome, either.

The gnome looks astonished at Ezra's words. "We haven't? Wait..." She pauses, rubbing her chin. "Oh yeah, we haven't yet! I always get this mixed up..." She sticks out a hand to Saeren, who is closest. "In that case, pleased to meet you. I'm Kala."

The night elf accepts the offered hand after staring at the gnome for a few long, awkward seconds. "I am called Saeren."

Ezra's face is hidden behind bandages, but even so, his whole demeanor undergoes a wondrous metamorphosis. "I ssee. The only dragonss I have met lived ... linearly," he says at last. "Sso. What does the Bronze Dragonflight wissh of us?"

Nerai looks at Ezra, then at the Gnome. She quirks her head. "Dragonflight?" She asks noone in particular....

Kala stares at Ezra blankly for a moment, then laughs aloud. "Ah, Ezra! You always were a sharp cookie. All right, all right. My full name is Kalidormi," she says, grinning, and nods toward Nerai. "And I'm actually a bronze dragon, as your mortally challenged friend here just deduced." The 'gnome' steps toward the circle. Peering at it, she sighs. "Such crude workmanship. But I guess that's a relief. Means it's just the Twilight's Hammer's usual meddling with what they don't understand. But..." She looks up at the Glaive. "_here_, even they could cause some trouble."

"We sseek to use the Essence of Aku'mai here. We wissh to interfere with the naga." Ezra gestures northward. "Otherss are already going elssewhere. We came here, hoping to find the secretss of breaking the naga curse."

Saeren, in her typical way, waits out the talking in silence. Dragonflight involvement in her mind means that the trouble is only starting.

"Hmm. Well, I can't help you with that myself," says Kala, "but maybe I can put you in touch with someone who can." She raises a hand toward the circle, which begins to glow again. As she does so, she grimaces. "In fact, it looks like I'll _have_ to, because I can't go through here. Blast! Oh yeah, now I remember. It's because I'm already there." She turns to the group. "How about it, folks? Want to meet a Titan?"

"I'm no dwarf," murmurs Ezra. "But yess. I would. If it will not interfere, no."

Nerai blinks a bit, "Do we realy have a choice?" She runs her fingers nerviously over Eecee's control knobs.

"I don't suppose you could take a short break from incoherent rambling to be a bit more clear, dragon?" asks Saeren. "Is the Titan going to help us?"

The gnome looks blank for a moment again, then chuckles softly. "All right, here's the deal," she says, pointing at the circle. "These silly geese have made a time portal here, and from the look of it, it goes back over a hundred thousand years. It must've taken them ages to work out when they needed to go, though I guess studying this ruin probably helped.

"Point is, I figure they've sent back a bunch of people to interfere in _this_ battle," she says, pointing at the Glaive. "And if we don't use _this_ portal to undo their interference, it's gonna be hard to get anyone else back there. It's complicated."

"That's much better," says Saeren. She even demonstrates a rare spark of civility, "Thank you for clarifying. So we go through this portal and destroy them." She frowns in thought, "I assume that you helped us get back here after we stopped them." A moment's pause. "That almost made sense."

Nerai says, "I'm glad it makes sense to someone. I think I'm still lost." She shrugs. "I'm sure it will make more sense later..."

"Well, no, I'm going to help you get back _now_," says Kala, pulling out a glittering quartz amulet. "When you're ready, you just need someone to invoke this and it'll open a portal to return you to your own time. If you could, it'd be handy if you chuck the Twilight's Hammer guys through, too. Helps if things stay in their own time." She hands the amulet to Ezra. "You guys ready to go?"

"Even if they're dead?" Nerai asks.

Saeren looks to Ezra, then to the dragon. "From what it sounds like, yes Nerai, we need to bring them back so they don't.. you know, change the past by rotting somewhere. Right?" She wishes she didn't even ask.

"I understand." Ezra receives the amulet.

"Good," says the gnome, stepping up to the circle. She begins to mutter in syllables that make Ezra's magical senses tingle, and the violet light flares again. Bright lights coruscate in a column within the circle, eventually blending together into a shimmering golden portal.

Saeren strides forward with a resigned look on her face. Now that the path is chosen she sees no point hesitating.

Ezra follows.

Nerai pilots Eecee back in following Ezra.

As Nerai prepares to step into the portal, there is a shout from beyond the Glaive. A shadowy bolt whizzes by behind Kala's back. "Good luck, guys!" she calls as she turns to face the remaining Twilights. As the portal closes behind the party, they can see her begin to grow...

But soon their attention is instead drawn to the place where they've arrived. Though it still seems to be quite similar to the woods of Darkshore, they seem to have stepped into a war in progress. High above, winged shapes pursue, or are pursued by, animate whirlwinds, while at ground level hordes of stony dwarf-like creatures do battle with murlocs, silithid, and other various beasties, surrounding giants who seem to be playing a role similar to siege engines.

"Remind me, who should I be shooting at this point?" are the first words from Saeren. "I should really have paid more attention to history."

Ezra looks about. "Find the cultistss, yes. They are our goal. The rest.... is preordained."

And right in front of them, an enormous dwarf-like being, wielding what is obviously the Glaive, is in one-on-one combat with a similarly sized mostrosity whose face is strange and unnatural. And between the party and this battle... a dozen orcs in the livery of the Twilight's Hammer rushing toward them.

Nerai points, "Hey Ezra... I think it might be them...."

Kagarn lays a hand on Saeren's shoulder. "Spirits be with you," he murmurs, and once again she feels a thrill of battle lust rush through her body.

Nerai drives Eecee up to the waters egde, holding her hands out and prepared to catch the orcs as they're incoming.

But the orcs don't even seem to have noticed the newcomers yet. Instead, they continue to rush forward toward the Titan, who likewise does not notice _them_ - until they begin to swing their scythes at the enormous being. Their effects fail to connect with him - but they distract him from the battle with the Faceless One, who seems to be preparing to take advantage.

Saeren fires three times, and every time finds the target. The foe isn't dead, but probably isn't as focused on the titan, either. For now, that seems the most important thing.

As he begins rushing across the field of battle, purple sparkles of arcane magic surround Ezra. With a muttered imprecation, he directs them in two directions: the first to the badly wounded orc, the second to another who is currently at the feet of the Titan.

The orc to the rear screams in agony as the missiles tear him to shreds, alerting the Twilights that there are newcomers to this battle. Two of the orcs wheel around and charge at Ezra full tilt; one of them misses by a hair, while the other's scythe slices into the mage's undead flesh.

Kagarn eyes the onrushing orcs critically, and then raises his totem. "Nerai! Spirits be with you as well!" he calls, following the name with a familiar chant, and the goblin finds all weariness passing from herself and a new strength seeping into her body.

So far, the Twilights' distraction has no effect on the battle at hand; the Faceless One attempts to swing one of its powerful limbs, but the Titan is prepared, blocking the blow with the polearm and returning with a deadly strike of his own.

Nerai runs up to the orcs wheelign around to catch Ezra, standing beside the forsaken wizard, her morningstar flails past the Orc, but flies wide of it's mark.

Responding to the battle cry, three more of the orcs turn and run toward the adventurers, their scythes at the ready; the other half of the Twilight expedition presses the attack on the Titan.

Saeren turns her attention to those threatening her friends and the fire of her attacks glows in her eyes. The first two arrows annihilate the nearest orc, while the last makes it very clear who she will be slaying next round.

Ezra's own missiles, albeit arcane in nature, again strike and seriously wound one of the orcs assailing the titan.

The only orc to survive the initial charge swings his scythe at Eecee, causing nothing more than the familiar clang of metal against metal.

Meanwhile, the battle between the behemoths continues. The servant of the Old Gods is still unable to press the advantage that the Twilight's Hammer is giving it, but it still manages to avoid the Titan's return blow.

Now that his friends are prepared for the battle, Kagarn joins in himself. He raises his totem, calling out to the powers of lightning, and the orc that had recently taken an arrow to the gut is now reduced to a smoking, twitching corpse.

Nerai moves Eecee into the path of the next oncoming orc, forcing the fanatic to come through her or around her. She then turn her attentions to the attacker on her friend, unleashing the fury of both of her weapons this time. THe Morningstar still flails wide of its mark, but the sword connects into the heck of the org, carving a large gash out of his shoulder.

The Twilights, undaunted by their dark champion's inability to take advantage of their assistance, continue to press their attempts at distraction. Nearer to hand, two more orcs swing their scythes at Nerai, apparently attempting the same trick on a smaller scale - their attacks not so much attempting to strike Nerai directly as to deny her ground.

Saeren steps slowly forward, unleashing her wrath once more. The first strike puts the foe on the brink of death, the second welcomes another into the coalition of the wounded, and the third cuts the grass in the distance.

More arcane missiles dart towards the orcs assaulting the titan. Ezra has no interest in the nearer orcs, now that they aren't directly injuring him; let Saeren and Nerai handle those.

Though gravely wounded, the orc in front of Eecee takes the opportunity his companions have afforded, and lashes out with his scythe, putting a noticeable gouge in the metal of the steam armor.

The valiant, albeit horribly misguided, efforts of the Twilight's Hammer to turn the tide of the battle still fail to bear fruit, though. The titan lands another solid blow despite the insects at his heels, and the Faceless One fails to return the favor.

Kagarn raises his totem once more, and another flash of lightning arcs across the battlefield. The orc manages to step clear of its path this time - but even the backwash is enough, and the wounded orc falls backward, dead.

Nerai starts to spin, her swarm-prevention tactics starting to take fold, as often as she's been allowed to deploy them. Her morningstar whips around her body, turning Eecee's frame 180 degrees from it's last miss it collides with the head of the orc formerly behind her, leaving him the worse for wear. Her sword, as deadly as ever, beginning the process of Twilight Hammer destruction on the new contender, reminding them that ignoring the goblin is probably not the best tactic.

One of the orcs surrounding Eecee moves past, swinging his scythe in distraction, while his companion swings in earnest, though with rather less luck this time. In the distance, the swarm around the feet of the Titan continue their attempts to keep him off balance.

Saeren again slowly steps forward, firing at the nearest enemies. The first shot puts the nearest orc down in a smoldering heap. The second arrow is fumbled and not even released, and the third, a hasty shot, delivers a staggering blow, though it doesn't leave the orc on its face.

Again the Forsaken's arcane missiles slam into the unguarded back of one of the orcish cultists. Ezra is clearly enjoying himself.

It seems that Ezra's attacks are taking their toll on the Twilight assault... or perhaps fate itself conspires against them. The Faceless One forces the Titan to defend itself, but even now cannot do any damage to his foe.

The last of the Twilights to face the party expires in another burst of lightning. Kagarn raises his totem high in the air. "For Azeroth!" he calls triumphantly.

Nerai sees that the way is clear. "We must stop all of them.." She salls out, running across the pond and finally catching up to where the Titan is fighting. She sees three of her friends atempting to carve their names into history. She taps one of them in the shoulder with her sword.

The Twilights are not so distracted from the task at hand as to ignore Nerai's arrival, but for now, at least, they try one last time to distract the Titan from _his_ task.

The archer's slow advance continues, but this time her shots rain down farther. Her fumbling continues on her first shot, but the second transmutes a wounded orc to a corpse. The third also strikes true, but does not kill her enemy.

Once again, Ezra attempts to close the distance so that his more potent spells can take effect. Once again, purple darts of arcane wrath strike at one of the orcs clustered around the transcendent being.

At long last, the Twilight distraction has some effect. The Forgotten One's fist gets past the Titan's guard and slams into his body, and the cracking of stone echoes across the battlefield. The Titan's groan sounds like rocks grinding together as he clutches the haft of the Glaive.

"No!" cries Kagarn, as he rushes forward behind Saeren and raises his totem to the heavens. Almost as loud as the Forgotten One's blow, the crack and flash of lightning streaks across the battlefield and incinerates one of the orcs in a single shot.

"Too little too late, my friends." Nerai says as a crooked smile stretches across her face. She lashes out at Orc on the end, morningstar rolling it's way through the purple robe of the cultest. The sword misses wide of it's mark, Eecee's joints squealing, "You can make it, baby..."

The Twilight's Hammer attack force is woefully undermanned now, fighting for what they can manage. One of them creeps around the Titan's ankles, still harrying him, while the others ease away, surrounding Nerai and trying, just as futilely, to double-team her.

A most creative curse comes from Saeren's lips as the first shot is again mishandled. The second and third are true, leaving another orc on the brink of death.

Realizing that he must abandon his policy of conservation, Ezra now launches into his more serious magic. A solid wall of sound smashes into one of the orcs flanking Eecee, and the steam armor's paint gains a splashy red streak.

Ironically, it is now, when the battle is turning against its allies, that the Faceless One's luck has begun to to change. Another blow cracks the Titan's stony flesh, and the guardian of order staggers.

Kagarn's power is more precise and controlled this time, but it is still enough to leave another orc's corpse twitching, lifeless, on the ground.

Nerai wheels Eecee around to the last standing member of the clan's number. She looks at the remaining orc, and smiles, pointing to the bloody mess at her feet. "I'm going to save you from that." As she whips the morning star, the chain and Eecee's frame creaking with the efford as the spikey mass falls flast onto the Orc's head. The red life leaks out of the fanatic, and he falls to the ground. Nerai pants, looking up at the titan.

Saeren moves faster this round, pausing just as she gets within sight of the enemy. She takes her aim carefully, but her shot does nothing to the foe, swerving wide somehow. "Didn't think it would be easy to shoot a god," she mutters under her breath. Frow the way she reaches back already to get another arrow, she's not going to give up so easily.

Not one to back down, Ezra joins Saeren in what might be a fruitless effort. His arcane missiles, though ineffective against a being of this sort of power, are still thrown with the same intensity of emotion behind them.

Now that he faces no further distractions, the Titan is able to bring his massive weapon to bear. The flyspeck distractions of the allies of order have even less effect on the Faceless One than the Twilights' had on the Titan, but now that the imbalance is corrected, it is clear that the two foes were unevenly matched to start.

The titan steps around another blow and slams the misshapen creature in the midriff with the haft of the Glaive, and when it bends double, the Titan brings the weapon around in a long sweeping arc that scythes the monstrosity's legs from under it. Placing a massive foot on the thing's chest, the Titan raises the Glaive and drives it deep into the creature's bizarre skull. The creature twitches once, and then is still.

Nerai starts to drag the bodies over into a neat pile, watching the clash of the Titan behind her as she does so. "I hope this works... There's not much left of that one guy." She mutters.

The Titan bellows out across the field in an echoing voice. None of the adventurers can understand his words but Ezra, but the message is simple enough even for his limited command of the language: "The Faceless One is defeated! Onward to victory!" And the tide of battle around them does indeed seem to turn; the murlocs, the silithid, and the other minions of the Old Gods seem weak and confused without their champion.

Now the massive creature turns and peers down. He speaks in a low rumble, and this time all understand. _I am grateful for your aid - but you are not familiar to me. Whence came you? And what can you tell me of these alien creatures who sought to hinder me?_ He gestures to the orc corpses that litter the ground. _What new minions have the Old Gods created?_

"We come ... with the aid of powerful creatures," replies Ezra, haltingly assembling spoken Titan. "They did not belong here. We were to cancel out their presence."

The creature actually smiles. _Your pronunciation is very odd, little cursed one. I take it you have not heard our language spoken before? But... yes, I understand better now._ The creature kneels down, and then narrows its eyes. _You bear objects tainted with the dark powers of this world, cursed one. Do you wish me to dispose of them?_

"The naga --" Ezra hesitates. "In our home, creatures related to my companion will become tainted by the magic of this world, and by one like that which you slew. We wish to break the curse on them. The essence in this vessel was to be part of that plan."

The titan looks at the chalice and the vial, and nods. _Ah yes, I see. Dagun schemes to turn the denizens of this world into his minions. But the curse on this vessel is weak, and you bear a fragment of the soul of one of his most powerful minions. These 'naga' that you speak of... are they servants of Dagun?_

Ezra nods. "They are."

The titan nods gravely. _Then if you grant me these items, I belive I will be able to turn the curse against itself. You will be left with a chalice that will **undo** the curse of Dagun rather than inflicting it. Do you believe you can make good use of such a tool?_

The mage looks to his companions. "The world you leave us is our own. All we can do is try to make the best use that we can." So saying, he extends the objects in both hands.

Nerai shrugs, "As Ezra says. But I know a lot of people that would be joyious at such a tool." Nerai says.

Grasping the vial delicately between two stony fingers, the titan begins to murmur in his language. This time, the words are far too complex for Ezra to follow, though he can feel the power behind them churning in his head, and from the look on Kagarn's face, the tauren feels it as well. The liquid in the vial begins to glow a brilliant white... and then the titan crushes it between his fingers. The glowing liquid splashes into the chalice and begins to creep up the sides, coming to an instant boil. There is a distant sound on the wind, akin to Aku'mai's death cry below Blackfathom...

_It is done_. The titan hands the chalice back to Ezra, and all four of the allies can see the difference on it. Whereas before the chalice had the faint stink of rotten fish, it now bears the smell of a cleansing rain.

Ezra inclines his head. "Thank you," he says.

Nerai nods similarly. "You have done far more then we did, I suspect."

Saeren remains silent as the grave during this exchange. She has done her part, and even had the honor of taking a shot-even if it was poorly aimed-at an old god.

_I wish I could help to cleanse **your** curse as well, but it goes deeper into your being,_ says the Titan to Ezra. _And I fear the result would only be to release your soul to the afterlife. It is a strange curse, though; there seems to be something of our **own** nature in it. Perhaps Champion Sargeras can tell us something of this... though he has seemed withdrawn lately._

"It is not a curse.... to me," is all Ezra will say, with a strange smile behind his bandages.

"One other thing. If you speak to Sargeras of my condition, perhaps you will tell him that I said of it: 'there is always hope.'"

_You seem to have overcome it,_ agrees the titan. _Well, fare well to you, then. I must return to this battle._ And with that, the titan steps away from the clearing. As the tides of war flow around his departing form, the heroes can see him fell a qiraji warrior in one punch...

Behind them, there is the flap of wings. As they turn, a bronze dragon settles onto the sand behind them. It seems to be amused. "So, little one, you hope to put your own little kink in history? I suppose it can be allowed. It was but a small thing, and you have done a much greater service to history today."

Ezra regards the dragon with narrowed eyes. "We musst all be true to oursselves. Isn't that right," he says.

"That's why I keep killing the enemy," says Saeren. Not that the opinion of one half-mad counts for much.

"These beings," says the dragon, lifting a purple-clad corpse in one claw, "also were true to themselves, mad as they must have been. But it is hazardous to meddle with history." The creature tilts its head. "Out of curiosity, which of our people sent you here?"

"Doesn't that information damage history?" asks Saeren.

"I would not have asked if it would," replies the dragon.

"Kalidormi," the mage replies, holding aloft the amulet he was given.

"And here I had hoped I was going to catch a trick question," says Saeren.

Nerai says, "Given how confused she seemed when we met her before, I assume the dragons live along their own sense of time anyway...."

"Kalidormi!" declares the dragon, and it laughs. "Now I understand why you were sent, rather than she coming herself. We can endure the paradox of learning _of_ each other at the wrong time, but to interact with our future selves - or our past selves - that we cannot manage. Nozdormu himself warns us of the terrible paradoxes _that_ could generate." The dragon tilts her head. "So I seemed confused, did I? Did I know your names when I met you?"

Nerai nods. "At that time, yes."

"Then what..." begins Kalidormi, and shakes her head. "Never mind. I have a feeling we will meet a _third_ time. I will ask your names then." And with a gust of wings, the bronze dragon takes to the skies once more.

"Kalidormi looks much better as a dragon than as a gnome," Saeren notes, smiling as the creature flies off. "The bronze flight come from a strange egg, but they seem good."

Ezra, feeling that the time has come to depart, concentrates on the amulet, and a new portal of golden light shimmers into existence.

Feeling a bit more charitable now, Saeren will help Nerai throw the orc corpses through. If she throws them a bit harder than is strictly necessary, that is really to be expected.

Nerai starts hefting bodies through the portal, with the help of Saeren.

"Broxigar, they broke your record," Ezra murmurs, once the bodies are gone. He, too, takes the portal back to his rightful time.

They emerge back in the grove that had grown up around the now-ancient Titan war weapon, to find Kalidormi, once more in gnome form, surrounded by robed figures. The faces that are visible are those of extremely old men and women. "Hi again!" declares Kalidormi cheerfully. "How'd it go?"

Nerai points down. "We're standing. They're not."

"We bring a warm greeting from you," Saeren answers. "Oh, and I am afraid I left a few arrows behind. I don't imagine I was supposed to grope about to find them."

"Don't worry about it," says Kala. "They'll rot in a couple decades, and then future archaeologists will just puzzle over a couple arrowheads. Well, I must rush. I know it seems strange that the guardians of time seem so short of it, but that's how it is."

"Goodbye," says Ezra, tipping his hat politely.

"I had a question," blurts Saeren. "And I forgot to ask it of the titan." She looks to the great weapon that gives this place its name. "Why was it left behind? We've wondered ever since we found this holy place."

"And what was his name?"

"Oh, that," says Kala. She walks up to the skull and taps on it. "The Titans weren't able to kill the Old Gods entirely, because their natures are tied too closely to the world, and to destroy them would be to destroy Azeroth. So the Old Gods were cast into perpetual slumber - at least, it was _supposed_ to be perpetual. Their most powerful minions, like this one, need to be bound with great power." She rubs her chin. "Who wielded _this_ weapon, you mean? Aggramar, I think. I'm not sure... it's been a while, I think."

"Than we owe him our gratitude," replies Saeren. "Thank you, as well, Kala. Goodbye.. until the next time."

Kala nods cheerfully, and trots off into the woods again, disappearing from sight.
