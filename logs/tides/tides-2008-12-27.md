# Turning Tides 2008-12-27

With the Twilight's Hammer enclave at the Master's Glaive destroyed by an angry bronze dragon, there is nothing left to obstruct the adventurers from returning to the Grove of the Ancients. When they arrive, they find Drusilla communing with the Ancient of Lore that presides there.

Looking on with curiosity - or perhaps drowsiness - is a druid who introduces himself as Kerlonian Evershade. Yawning, he says, "Don't interrupt them. They've been on like this for hours. I was going to travel on to Maestra's Post, but this has been so fascinating..."

Even as he speaks, Drusilla opens her eyes. "They've returned?" she asks, turning. "Ah, so they have. How did matters fare on your quest?"

Ezra hefts the converted chalice. "I wissh to procure a live naga," he announces.

The Ancient stirs. "The naga?" he asks, in a voice that sounds like the creak of branches. "They have maintained a settlement on the coast, far north of here, for many centuries. They have been quite hostile to outsiders - and from what Drusilla has told me, they may be even more so now. What do you want with them?"

The Forsaken wheezes with the effort of drawing breath, eyeing the Ancient with his glowing eyes. "Break the cursse. Yes."

Saeren eyes the sleepy druid with disinterest, turning her attention back to the ancient. She doesn't show any sign of distaste concerning the curse of the naga. After all, just because a curse is broken doesn't mean they won't give her new reasons to shoot them. "I wonder what will happen to them," she muses quietly.

"I'm ... curious about that myself," the mage admits.

"They would cease to be naga. I hope," says Saeren. Then she can still claim she's made them extinct. Just in a nicer way. Win-win.

With this in mind, Ezra turns to look at Saeren. "You hate the naga, yess. The murlocss, the creaturess of the sea. They may lose that quality. Become something new. I wonder... will you hate them more, or less."

Saeren meets Ezra's eyes and lets out a sigh. "I don't think it's hate anymore. It's what I am, a continuation like the flowing tides. I don't know if you can understand." She tightens her hands into fists, "Perhaps you of all people can understand. I'm not sure there's enough of me left to hate."

The ancient rubs its craggy beard. "A curse... yes, now I remember. There must be powerful restorative magic in that chalice, if it has any hope of breaking it. But even with great power... I warn you that our lore tells us that at least some of the Highborne _chose_ their fate. They were proud and corrupted by the arcane, and the dark powers offered them more than just their lives. A curse of this sort cannot be broken unless, deep down, the victim wishes to be free of it."

The Forsaken says nothing more to his companion. Instead, he looks up at the Ancient. "I will ssubject every naga I find to this treatment," he says simply. "They may have whatever choice is theirss. But I will not permit this business to continue unabated, no."

"We must try," agrees Saeren. "It is the only way this story can have anything resembling a good ending."

"I wish you luck," says the Ancient. "The naga have been a thorn in the side of the night elves for ten thousand years." He nods to the draenei. "The advent of her people, however, is a promising sign. You would do well to encourage good relations with them."

"We are going to their... eh, landing site as our next desstination," Ezra explains.

The Ancient nods. "That is well, then. May Elune light your path." There is a snore nearby - the druid has fallen asleep. Onu sighs and addresses the sentinel escort. "On your return trip to Maestra's Post, please escort Kerlonian there. You may need a stretcher."

---

As the party travels north along the road, they come to a fork in the road. The sentinels close ranks and seem impatient to continue. Drusilla, ever the curious one, asks, "What lies on the eastern fork?" One of the escorts shakes her head and says abruptly, "Ruins of Ameth'aran. No one lives there." The wind howls from the east, with a sound uncannily like an elven voice.

"Very few live in Undercity either," Ezra mutters darkly.

Saeren interjects, "We have business, standing about here is not achieving it."

The sentinel glares at Ezra, but it is Kagarn who interjects. "What manner of spirits haunt that place?" he asks. The escorts seem to be of a mind with Saeren and are hurrying the party northward, but one of them answers. "The ghosts of the Highborne, slain in vast ages past."

A sudden burst of hideous laughter erupts from the Forsaken, but he does not bother to elaborate or explain.

Saeren looks askance at Ezra, but doesn't ask. It's probably for the best.

The escorts are, if anything, even more unsettled than Saeren, and a few finger their bowstrings. Drusilla, however, looks back to the crossroads as it recees in the distance and sighs. "Would that we could bring them rest."

---

Auberdine is, if anything, an even larger settlement than Astranaar, almost on the verge of being a city. Many of the buildings are new, less than a few years old; only a few of the older buildings remain, showing scars from the Third War.

Ezra has noticed the reception he's received among the elves of late. At this point, he's fully prepared to enter Auberdine having already been impaled on some moonforged weapon.

The adventurers are greeted at the gate. "Hail!" calls the guard leader. "What news from Maestra?" She looks askance at the zombie, goblin, and tauren, but does not comment on them, her attention being focused on the blue-skinned newcomer. "And who is this?"

"We found her in the wild," says Saeren drily. "I'm hoping if I ask my parents nicely they'll let me keep her. She followed us home, after all."

The draenei takes a step forward. "I am Drusilla of the draenei, and by accident of circumstance I am the emissary of my kind to your world." Her Common has grown much better over the past weeks, but still has a strong accent. She glances back over her shoulder at Saeren with a wry smile.

The guard captain seems puzzled, but nods. "We will take you to see our-" she begins, but Drusilla shakes her head. "I am not prepared to speak for my people," she says. "But if you can find an emissary of your own people, I can guide you over the sea to the island where we landed." The captain nods. "I will see what I can do."

One of the escorts steps forward, bearing a bundle of letters. "Our other guests have been of some help in Maestra's Post," she says. "Orendil Broadleaf requests that they be granted your hospitality." This is received rather less well. "Take them to one of the huts," says the captain brusquely. "I will consider his request."

The adventurers are led to a small hut near the edge of the village, with sentinels stationed at every door and window. This house arrest is only temporary, though, as the guard captain soon returns, a little less hostile now. "It seems I was perhaps too hasty," she says. "These are not trusting times, as I'm sure you appreciate." She nods to Ezra. "I understand you wish to speak with people in authority about the danger Orendil describes. Where do you wish to go first?"

"First, the elvess and the draenei musst meet with one another," Ezra explains. "I proposse to go to their landing ssite myself and tell them what we have learned. An elf should accompany uss. In addition, it sseems these creaturess have an affinity for the Light too... perhapss the paladin we met earlier."

The captain nods. "We have already sent word to Darnassus requesting an emissary, and Delgren wishes to travel with that party as well. I believe it will take several days to get a response, though. Please feel free to explore Auberdine in the meantime." She turns to go, then returns. "Ah - one of the priestesses of the Moon has asked about you. She is interested in your encounters with the murlocs. Shall I send her here?"

Ezra nods. "Of coursse. Informing you is our mission, yess."

Shortly thereafter, a tall, pale-haired night elf appears at the house. "I am Gwynneth Bly'leggonde," she says. "Perhaps you can help me shed some light on a mystery I've been puzzling over." She explains further: apparently the number of beached sea creatures has increased markedly over the past several months. "I was sent by the Temple to investigate," she says, "but I have been unable to approach the carcasses, as they are surrounded by hostile murlocs."

Ezra hums. "Interessting. Of course, we will be driving the creaturess away from this region anyway.. or at least assisting otherss to do so, yes." He straightens up. "We intend to visit this rumored naga-infested ruin soon, yess. Perhapss you will come with uss when we do, and along the way you will find what you seek."

Nerai scrates her chin and looks at Gwynneth, "They're not just boing driven out by the uptake in Murloc activity?" She asks, in their 'cell'

"That's part of what we're hoping to find out," says Gwynneth. "It's normal for a few sea turtles or threshers to beach themselves, but not in these numbers."

Auberdine is a port town and thus, unlike many other night elf settlements, it has bustling populations of other races - as Nerai soon finds out. While she is working on Eecee, she hears a sharp gnomish voice. "Well, look at that. I never thought I'd see the day a _goblin_ ventured into Auberdine," says the wizened little gnome behind her, his voice dripping with scorn. "Working on one of your precious shredders are you?"

Nerai blehs and stares over. She looks over at Eecee, then back at the gnome. She pulls out a slide rule, very meticulously, and then says, "Yup. The average time to shred a gnome would be 13.8 seconds. She peers over the top of the device, and grins, "Probably closer to 8 for you." "

The gnome snorts. "Not bloody likel-" he begins, and then peers at Eecee. "Wait a minute... that's a dwarvish design!" he yells, stalking up to the cart and seething with outrage. "Where did you get the design for that, you little thief?!"

Nerai inhales sharpely, seemingly unworried that the Gnome is mad at her. After all that was the point. "From my master, Rolf Drakfeuer. Willingly gave me the designs, and taught me how to build, fix and maintain it." She glares back at the rude Gnome. "He also taught me not to jump to conclusions; a lesson I've found almost everyone around here could learn."

The gnome's eyes pop. "Rolf Drakfeuer?" he says, hopping onto the cart and kicking the side of Eecee. "How dare you-" he trails off, reaching out more gently with one hand. "That's... that's Rolf's maker's mark," he says, jaw agape in wonder. "How... how did you come to meet him?" says the gnome, sounding a lot more chastened.

Seeing the little runt kick Eecee pulls Saeren from the sidelines. "You going to disturb the peace of Auberdine?" she delivers in a growl. "Guests are usually welcomed here, but they are to behave in a civil manner."

Nerai smiles, and leans back against Eecee. "It's kind of a long story; and honestly the details aren't the best things to share with others." Her eyes flash in a but of memory. "I was brought to him to fulfill some treaty or another." She waves her hand in the air, trying to brush off the actual importance of such a thing. People asking too many questions MIGHT actually be working for the clan, after all. She turns to Saeren. "Ah, diplomacy has arrived." She smiles, "No, he is just standing for what he believes is right. He seems fine, now..."

The gnome glances at Saeren, and bows. "Sorry!" he says. "It's just... you've got to understand, among us tinkers, designs are a precious commodity. Just like spells, for wizards. So when I saw a goblin working on a dwarf steam armor, I just..." He trails off, shaking his head, and sticks out a hand. "Pleased to meet you! Wizbang Cranktoggle, at your service."

"Just remember where you are before reaching conclusions. The Alliance does not make a practice of harboring thieves." replies Saeren. Seeing no trouble other than her own brooding presence, the night elf leaves Nerai and Wizbang to themselves.

Nerai nods, and holds out her hand, shaking the gnome's. "Yes. I do understand. It's pretty cut throat out there. For everyone it seems." She smiles, and nods her head a bit. "At least it's nice to hear a friendly tone around here that's not asking for help." She looks at Wizbang.

Wizbang laughs. "I'm fine for now," he says. "Having a little problems with my buzzboxes, but nothing I can't solve on my own. So - what's your name? And what brings you to Auberdine, if I may ask?"

Nerai blushes profusely at her slip of manners, assuming everyone knows her name. She crosses her eyes, "It's not written on my forehead?" She grins, "I'm Nerai Escapement." She nods, "We're.. Well hmm." As she watches Saeren walk away. "We're making our way across the land. Dealing with some of this Murloc problem people seem to be having." Trying to stay as general about it as possible. No need to scare the new friend away immediately.

"Murlocs, eh?" says Wizbang. "Kind of out of my field. I mostly work on sound technology, as well as, ahem, dabbling in a little amateur alchemy," he adds, lowering his voice a little. "Like I said, I'm working on these buzzboxes. Let you talk over long distances! Rather proud of 'em really."

Nerai perks up, interested, and looking at the Gnome. "So, how do they work?" She smiles, and nods, "Do you mind giving us a test?" She grins, content to follow the Gnome.

"Well... you'll have to go out into the wilderness a ways to test 'em properly, but..." The gnome hops off the cart and leads Nerai to his workshop. A few dwarves give Nerai puzzled glances, but Wizbang waves them off with a cheery "Don't worry, she's with me."

Inside the workshop, Wizbang sifts through the chaotic clutter of a typical tinker's domain until he fishes out something about the size of a breadbox, covered with wheels and gears, and with a circular tin disk set into the side of the machinery. "This isn't a full featured model, so I have to crank it up," he says, furiously turning a crank on one side of the machine.

"Well, I think we're just about to head to the beach anyway, so I'm sure I could test it for you while I'm out there." Nerai smiles, and looks at the box. "Well, physical motive power isn't always bad. At least it doesn't blow up, yes?"

"Yeah, but the full working models use, uh, animal matter to power it. They reprocess it into fuel, and leave a nice little byproduct... there!" he says, as some of the lights on the thing begin to glow. "Now I've got this box over here..." he says, trotting over to a similar-looking box on the far wall. He leans over the box and whispers into its disc - and the disc on Nerai's box whispers, "Can you hear me?"

Nerai whispers back into the box. "No. I mean yes." Quietly so maybe Wizbang could hear her. "Hey these could be very useful." She says, in her normal volume. Then she covers her mouth and wishes she hadn't.

"I'll say!" says the voice from the disc. "I'm still working on the range, but I've got them up to a couple hundred miles. Could be really handy for getting messages around without having to have people travel through dangerous parts." Wizbang stands up and walks back. "So, what do you think?"

Nerai hmms and taps her chin. "I think they're great..." She thinks for a moment. "I'd be interested in getting the plans, if you're willing to part with them." She hmms, and looks, "I'd be willing to pay, of course..." he looks at the box curiosly. "Pretty useful..."

Wizbang laughs. "Now hold on, lady," he says jovially. "I don't trust you _that_ much yet! Besides, these are in the prototype stage. At least one end needs a power supply at least as big as a steam armor. If you're gonna be out adventuring, though, I suppose I could lend you the portable unit, with a deposit of course. Could come in handy if you get in big trouble and need to yell for help. Unless it throws a gear, of course."

Nerai shrugs, "Ther's always that chance, right. But at least at this point I might be able to figure out where the sprung gear sits." She nods, "I would be very interested, as you say." She nods, "Plus maybe we could work on grafting one TO a steam armor at some point. THink of the potential." Nerai sure is...

"Well, I suppose you could have a steam armor carry a base station, but I'm gonna have to get it a lot smaller before you could actually have one on it in battle," says Wizbang, tugging on his beard. "But yeah, I'll think about it. Tell you what, swing by if you're on your way up the beach and I'll lend you this unit. Feel free to look into it on the way up. Maybe you can find a way to make it smaller, eh?"

Nerai nods to Wizbang, "I sure will!" She beams him a smile, and nods, "That is, as long as you don't mind working with a goblin." She nods, and then bows, "I am going to take my leave, however. See you soon, I hope."

Wizbang grins. "Just don't tell my buddies, eh? Not till I've had a chance to show them your work!" He waves to Nerai. "G'bye now!"
