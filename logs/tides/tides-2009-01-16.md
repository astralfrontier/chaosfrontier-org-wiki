# Turning Tides 2009-01-16

Ezra has been observing Saeren's interactions with Asprah, the former priestess of the Tides and now returning priestess of Elune. Gone is the cold and calculating murderess which the Forsaken wizard has seen so many times among his own people. Nor have the fires of vengeance been particularly stoked.

Instead, what he observes is something approaching normality from the stilted, insular elf. And so once safely within the shelter of Auberdine, with the half-Highborne in tow, Ezra makes an unhealthy gurgling sound that would be a polite cough for attention among the breathing races.

Saeren is used to Ezra making unpleasant sounds. Come to think of it, she's used to being unpleasant in general. "Something wrong?" she asks. She idly wonders what the people of Auberdine would do if Ezra literally coughed-up a lung in front of them while waiting for his response.

"This is yours now, yess." Ezra extends the purified chalice, offering it to Saeren. "You are its new caretaker."

Saeren hesitates for a moment, then reaches out to take the chalice. "I will guard it, but I don't have the skills to convince them to use it," she replies. "Will you continue to help me with this?"

The wizard chortles. "Of coursse," he answers. "I am committed to thiss task. You undersstand, I think. As for convincing... well, first, you musst convince yourself that redemption iss more worthwhile than annihilation. And you are acting very sstrange, very peculiar, yes. I wissh to see what you do next."

Saeren lifts the chalice and looks at Ezra seriously, "I just realized that for the first time there's a weapon I can use to destroy my enemy in a way more wondrous than arrows and death." Her eyes take in the chalice slowly, "Less importantly, in a very real way, every time one of them is redeemed my soul takes in a gasp of air. I think by saving them-all of them-I might just also save myself. I have killed what I saw as evil, but now there is a means to literally destroy the evil without killing the afflicted."

"I am starting to think that I just might be able to save everyone."

"That iss why you are a ssuitable guardian for it," says Ezra, bobbing his head and grinning through his bandages.

"I will do my best," replies Saeren. "But my heart has long been sick. I need time to recover further. She is the key to it all, though. By helping her, I heal myself. I knew I was broken before, it just didn't seem to matter. It was easy to be nothing more than an arrow."

"Yess. You need no great skill at convincing others. Your own conviction will sserve." Ezra gestures at the chalice. "We musst understand how to make more, in time. But for now.. well. Thingss are as they should be."

"Knowing what becomes of those who are freed of the curse is a start," replies Saeren. "There is someone I will send for who just might be able to help us. Unless I miss my guess, she will be very excited when she hears that I'm.. back."
