If there is one way in which gate guards are reliable, it is in reacting negatively to the unusual. "Halt!" calls the sentinel on guard at Auberdine. "What is the meaning of this? It's bad enough that we allow _you_ into our city," she says, glaring at Ezra, "but a naga?"

Asprah glides forward, making a show of keeping her hands visible. Even her weapon is in Saeren's hands for safekeeping at the moment. "Greetings, night elf," she says pleasantly. "I am Asprah, priestess of Elune, and I humbly beg admittance to your city."

"Priestess of Elune? What madness is this?" replies the sentinel, bewildered, then shakes her head. "Never mind. Come with us," she says, and two of the sentinels start forward to flank Asprah.

Saeren steps forward, "You shall treat me exactly as you treat her." She offers her hands in the same way. "Judging from what you know of me, do you really think she's a naga?" demands the night elf. She doesn't let them answer. "I want a message to be sent to High Priestess Tyrande."

Nerai wanders up to the gate as she hears about a comotion there. She sighs, and walks over to the gate, still staying on the inside part for now. She open her mouth, but watches Saeren. Maybe we'll try this method first.

This forces the sentinel on guard to think. "_You_... Saeren Finblighter... are taking a _naga_ under your countenance?" she replies. She looks at Asprah again, and notes the lack of scales or fins. Another glance to Saeren, and then to Asprah. Finally: "Very well. Bring _all_ of them to the house set aside for the Forsaken emissary," she says, indicating Ezra. She addresses Saeren again. "Your message to the High Priestess will be sent promptly."

Ezra just smiles and tips his hat politely.

The gloomy Finblighter smiles suddenly. "It is appreciated," Saeren says warmly. "I do not have a long message. Simply tell her that Saeren has found hope and begs to share it with her."

For the second time, the group is escorted under armed guard to their temporary residence. "The... naga," says the sentinel, as they enter, "is to remain here until I have further orders. The rest of you are free to travel, as before." She directs another confused glance at Asprah, and departs.

Drusilla, the draenei, is waiting for them when they return. Her eyes glow brighter when she notices the newcomer. "The chalice worked, then?" she asks.

Saeren grins at the confused look on the sentinel. "At least we're not in a cell," the elf says, turning to face Asprah. "Don't fear, the High Priestess will be thrilled to see you."

"Maybe." Nerai notes. "It seems very few people of this land are ever thrilled to see us." She smiles, and nods to Asprah. "I'm Nerai, by the way. Pleased to meet you?" Her voice has a tinge of nerviousness too it, and she looks to Ezra and Saeren as she speaks.

Asprah nods. "I hope so," she says to Saeren, and bows to Nerai and Drusilla. "If you are the companions of my saviors, then I am likewise pleased to meet you."

Ezra seems quite relaxed about this entire business. "Sshe iss what she iss," he remarks.

Gwynneth enters, looking puzzled. "I heard you had returned. I need to speak with..." she begins, and trails off, as she notices Asprah. "What in the name of Elune...?"

"Someone you may wissh to put your question to," Ezra suggests. "Ssomeone with knowledge of the murlocss, yess."

The pale-haired night elf looks even more confused for a moment. "I... well, yes, it's about that I wish to talk. You see, there are some new reports from the sentinels about the murloc villages..."

Gwynneth continues. Apparently the sentinels, on request, approached some known murloc villages that lacked any sign of beached sea creatures. Those murlocs were no more aggressive than usual - they would chase intruders away, but return to their business when the sentinels retreated. The murlocs near the beached creatures, on the other hand, would continue to chase the sentinels deep into the forest until they lost track or faced an overwhelming force.

Nerai looks between Asprah and Gwynneth. "I assume the creatures aren't markedly different from normal, themselves? Except the behavior-wise you have been discussing?"

Asprah looks grim. "They have begun, then," she says, shaking her head. "The naga of Mathystra were ordered to begin subverting the local murloc tribes. I don't know the details, but my superiors spoke of 'reminding the fishmen where their loyalties lie'. They did not sound like they intended to ask nicely." She smiles sadly. "Of course, asking nicely is a talent my former people have seldom chose to develop in any case."

Nerai says, "So what can we do to stop them? " Nerai wonders out loud, not really asking the question of any given person.

"We must redeem more of Asprah's people," says Saeren. "I wonder, though.. will all of the naga be able to be saved in this way?"

Asprah shakes her head. "The power of that chalice is not great enough to overcome the will of Dagun on its own. I would have been unaffected had my own will not added to its power. Some of my former kin serve Dagun gladly. They would resist its power."

"But those who wish to be free can now be given that chance," says Saeren. "It is right to give them all that opportunity."

Nerai says, "I wonder about the Murlocs, though..."

"Ah," says Asprah. "There you may be able to intervene. Have we a map?" Gwynneth nods, laying out a map on the table, with several murloc villages already marked. Asprah indicates a few. "These were to be soon on the timetable," she remarks.

Nerai nods. "It's certainly a place to start. Better then slaughtering half the population just for being agressive."

Gwynneth nods. "I have been studying the murlocs for quite some time. Left to themselves, they tend to venerate anything associated with the sea. One tribe even worshipped a giant thresher, until it was consumed by a pack of sharks." She rubs her chin. "The naga have often worked with them in the past, only to find that the murlocs' attentions are often fickle."

Saeren doesn't comment on that. She has a feeling the 'why stop at half' line of thinking in her mind isn't proper. Listening to Gwynneth jars her out of silence, though. "Asprah was associated with the sea.."

Asprah nods. "Like Gwynneth said, my kin could command a murloc tribe for a year or two, but we had to constantly demonstrate our power, or they would be distracted and worship some other sea creature or spirit instead. I don't know what my superiors have in mind, but I think they want a more stable allegiance."

Saeren hmmss, "I don't know what to suggest exactly then. We need to figure out what they are doing. Or maybe I do.. they need to show their power. Could they have a great beast that is killing these beached animals as a demonstration of that power?"

"Have you had a chance to inspect any of the corpses?" asks Asprah, to which Gwynneth shakes her head. "We would need to drive off the murlocs, and the sentinels refuse to commit the level of force that would be needed."

"There are other ways," suggests Saeren. She looks to Ezra, "Right?"

Ezra puts his fingers together. "Yessss, there may be," he says after a moment. "We will see what we can do. But.... we musst also attend to the presence of the Draenei."

Drusilla shakes her head. "They told me it will be a few days more before the emissary is ready."

Ezra nods. "Very well. Let uss go together. We will show these elvess what arcane magic can do, yess."

Saeren looks a bit uncomfortable at the thought of leaving Asprah behind. "I wish I had more people I could trust," she grumbles in Darnassian.

"Oh? Is someone going to stop her?" Ezra asks with a cold smile.

Saeren arches an eyebrow at Ezra, then smirks. "I like your way of thinking."

Nerai says, "Yeah, I think you're rubbing off on him."

"Come." Ezra rises, beckoning with a hand, making for the exit.

The sentinels on guard outside watch Ezra warily as he passes, but make no further move - until Asprah emerges. "Halt," says one of them, raising a hand to bar the way. "We're under orders to keep you here. You will not be harmed, but we cannot allow you to roam freely."

The wizard wheels and stalks back toward the sentinels, staring up at them. "Why?" he says, his voice a stark challenge.

"Because she is - or was - a naga," says the sentinel. "And she has not yet proven herself to us, as you have." Beside her, responding to Ezra's tone, the other guard nocks an arrow, though she does not yet draw or raise the bow.

"How will she do that, hmm?" asks Ezra. His tone is now more conciliatory.

"That's not my business," replies the guard. "When I have orders to let her move freely, I'll do so. Not before."

"And if we went anyway, you'd shoot us all dead, yes. And then what?" the wizard asks. "What happenss then? Not to us, mind you. To you."

"Your orderss are nothing more than fear and uncertainty. Your reluctance to trust a priestess of your goddess who was once your enemy. She can prove nothing while she sits quietly." Ezra gestures to Gwyneth. "Thiss elf has a concern about the murlocss. We can ansswer that concern. But we wissh for Asprah's expertisse. If you don't trusst her, send a ssentinel. Or a squad of them."

Gwynneth speaks up. "Send the sentinels that were assigned to me. I'm sure they will be able to handle one lone naga priestess, if the need arises."

The sentinel looks uncertain. "Sending the naga out under guard might be acceptable. But what if she leads you all into a trap?"

Nerai says, "Then you'll need to send someone else to look at the Murlocs."

Saeren finally follows the others out, hearing just the last words. She says nothing yet, moving to stand beside Asprah, the implication clear that she is here to protect the former naga.

The wizard lets forth a diabolical laugh. "If it iss a trap then you are freed of a goblin, an undead arcanist, and a troublesome and rebellious archer. Your ssentinels already risked their livess, yess. Just for the ssake of studying the murlocss. Why spring such a foolish trap now, when you are on the alert for it?"

"Lissten closely. The massed forces of the naga are capable of overcoming guarded fortresses and strongholdss more paranoid than yours. They have done so. You enjoy a resspite now, but it will not lasst. You do not have the luxury of patience, whiling away your long lifespanss while the fishpeople plot. You musst act. Failing that, you musst allow us to act."

The sentinel stares at Ezra for a moment, then nods to Gwynneth. "Go and speak with your liaison. If she approves this plan, return with your sentinels." Gwynneth nods, and departs. It is mere minutes before the temple priestess returns with two sentinels in tow, who take up station beside Asprah. "We're under orders to escort the altered naga," says one. "She is not to have the opportunity to interact with any other naga or sea-folk, but she may assist you in any other way."

Ezra nods, satisfied.

"Her name is Asprah," says Saeren. "As she is my guest and under my protection, please be polite and use it."

As the party heads out of town, Asprah speaks up. "Where are we going first, then?"

Nerai looks. "We're heading to the next camp that's going to be visited by your former friends, right?"

Ezra nods. "That iss where we can do the mosst good."

---

Under Asprah's guidance, the crew is led to the edge of the forest. The waves of the Veiled Sea wash over a sandy stretch of beach, where a number of murlocs can be observed going about their daily business - spear-fishing in the nearby shallows, butchering their catches, mending huts. There is no sign of a beached sea creature. Asprah nods. "They have not arrived yet," she whispers.

Ezra thinks slowly. "What is their technique?" he asks at last. "Victory over a thressher or turtle?"

"I don't think so," Asprah replies. "They usually send out a sea-witch with these parties. My suspicion is that the creature is sacrificed ritually. That is why I asked if they had inspected the corpses."

Nerai blinks. "This has been bothering me for a bit.... How do we convince the Murlocs that we're fighting to help them... You know, without getting into a two front battle." She looks up at the Sentinels. "I would say Asprah could help there.. But..." She trails off...

Ezra begins incanting a spell. "Assprah, come with me," he says as the spell completes. But what does the speaking depends on who looks. To Saeren, it is a rough-hewn night elf. To Nerai, a hunched-over goblin. And to Asprah... well, Ezra privately is rather curious about that.

Nerai looks at Ezra. "What good is a Goblin going to do...." She says, without thinking it through too much...

Kagarn blinks, and then chuckles. "Sending a murloc emissary to them, eh?" rumbles the great tauren. "Very devious, mage. Very devious."

Saeren has her opinion of the plan. She begins drawing out arrows and arranging them in front of her for easy firing. "Back-up," she explains to no one in particular.

Ezra begins walking toward the murloc encampment. "You will know if we are in danger, I think," he mutters.

The sentinels, likewise, have an opinion. "We were instructed not to allow her to interact with the sea-people," says one, as they both draw arrows of their own.

"Then she will stay back and keep silent. I only need her as an example. Or is that not satisfactory?" Ezra asks.

The sentinels think about this, then nod. "We will be covering you. Until she returns, her first word will be her last."

Saeren draws her bow and whispers to the others, "Focus on protecting her instead of shooting her. One of you on either side. Fully drawn by turns, don't be careless or you'll get tired. I'll start."

"Saeren. When things get interesting, give me a sign?" Nerai asks, and jogs back to the cart, getting Eecee into as much position as she can without turning him on.

The sentinels glare at Saeren, and shake their heads. "We have our orders," says one, but the other interrupts. "So long as she keeps silent, we will cover her retreat, should that prove necessary."

As the disguised mage approaches the beach, Asprah in tow, the murlocs are quick to react. The nearest ones draw spears and advance threateningly, calling out in a tongue Ezra does not recognize; it is clearly derived from Nerglish, but the intonation and vocabulary are subtly changed. The best Ezra (and Saeren) can make of it is a threat and a warning.

Ezra quickly incants the Tongues spell, yelling back in kind: "A warning to all murlocs of this tribe! Hear me!"

The commotion has drawn another murloc from a nearby hut. His scales are a duller shade of grey than the rest, and his eyes cloudy, and he approaches supported by an ornately carved stick. When he is near enough, he calls out in reply. "Who are you, stranger-kin, and why do you stray so far from your own village?"

Ezra thinks fast. Metaphor and description. "The purple-skinned peoples with long ears have become powerful. And they have allies. Look!" He points behind him, indicating Asprah. "That was once a naga. Now a priestess of their goddess."

The old murloc's eyes turn toward Asprah, then back to Ezra. "The purple-skinned ones are creatures of the land. Does the land intend to make war upon the sea, then?"

"The naga start a war," Ezra replies. "They bring the power of their dark god from the depths. They even work with land-dwellers who worship dark creatures. They are desperate for allies and soldiers. But their power is already broken."

"Interesting," says the murloc, his hands caressing the walking-stick. "But what is that to us?"

"They will come to you soon, and try to force you to help them. They might ask, or they might come and threaten. But they will surely come to you. Deny them, and the night elves will fight them off with you. But if you accept them, your tribe is doomed." Ezra points west to the ocean. "Do you remember the big wave? The elves' allies, skins blue as the ocean itself, caused it."

"We have seen such big waves before," says the murloc. "Bigger than that one. My great-grandfather spoke of a tsunami that engulfed the entire village. The sea is powerful, but its whims are beyond us."

"Then it must be that the sea has turned against the naga. Heed my words!" Ezra turns to leave.

The murloc nods. "We thank you for the warning," he says sardonically. "Return to your village, and we will return to ours." The old murloc slowly makes his way back to his hut, the younger ones warily watching Ezra's return to the wood.

---

Several hours pass with no change; the murlocs return to their business, and the adventurers lie in wait. Finally, as the sun begins to set, Saeren's keen eyes notice something: the ripples on the ocean's surface, many yards out, show signs of something large moving beneath the water.

As the disturbance approaches, the murlocs notice it as well. Alarm calls go out in their peculiar Nerglish dialect, and they gather themselves at the water's edge, spears at the ready. The old chieftain is nowhere to be seen; he has not emerged from his hut since Ezra's visit.

"Perk up," whispers Saeren. She fits an arrow to the string. "I believe we're about to do this the hard way."

"Let the murlocss decide that," counsels Ezra. "We musst wait and ssee."

Finally, something breaks the surface of the water. It is a giant turtle, easily ten feet across its shell; it wears a bridle and saddle, in which is riding a Greymist murloc; beside it is a naga, wearing a brightly painted tunic and carrying a long staff.

The murlocs on the shore call out their warning cries, waving their spears; the turtle's riders ignore the cries. Finally, the tribe looses a fusillade of spears, but the distance is too great yet, and most of them fall short. The naga rears up on her side and holds her staff above her head, calling out in an arcane tongue.

Instantly, the murlocs sway, their eyes lidded, and every last one of the fish-men falls over, fast asleep. All but one; the old murloc emerges from his hut, gapes at his comrades, and raises his staff, crying out in rage and fear. Before he can complete his cry, however, four other murlocs emerge from the surf in front of the turtle, their spears pointed at the old one, and they call out a warning. The chieftain pauses, then slumps, looking fearfully at the invaders.

"Attack," grunts the Forsaken mage.

Saeren's first two shots are lost to the winds, and the third strangely is frozen even as it strikes the enemy. "Gonna need an extra dose for the witch," growls Saeren.

The naga cries out in surprise, and then calls out in Nerglish, "Go see to that!" Two of the murlocs emerge from the surf and run toward Saeren, spears at the ready.

Kagarn chuckles softly, and begins a familiar incantation, asking the spirits to lend their strength to Saeren.

The murloc atop the turtle calls out a command and slaps its heels against the creature's neck, guiding it closer in to shore; meanwhile, one of his companions emerges from the water to join the charge.

Nerai turns on Eecee and opens up the throttle, charging at them at full speed, to give his companions more time to make with the killings. Eecee's heavy footfalls clamor out of the woods, as Nerai skillfully pilots the armor near the old playmates.

The last of the murlocs emerges from the water to take up position around Eeecee. Meanwhile, the murloc aboard the turtle stands up and draws an extremely deadly-looking crossbow and fires at Eecee; the quarrel sticks in one of the fighting machine's gears, and there is the squeal of metal suddenly being chilled to the freezing point. The murloc cocks the crossbow with a lightning-fast action and fires a second shot, which fortunately goes wide.

"I wouldn't worry about her," announces Ezra offhandedly, incanting a powerful fire spell that slams into the very surprised, and now very stunned, naga witch.

Saeren smirks and easily shifts her aim. This time two of her shots hit, ripping past the leather armor of her self-proclaimed nemesis. "We'll see what range you have on that toy," she growls softly.

The murlocs swarm around Eecee, jabbing their spears at the steam armor - though one of their attacks is clumsy enough that Nerai can easily recognize it as a feint.

"The turtle rider is a formidable foe," comments Kagarn, raising his totem into the air. The air flashes and cracks, and a surge of lightning causes the murloc to scream in pain - but though its armor is blackened, it fights on.

Angrily, it spurs the turtle out of the water and up the beach, the creature heaving its ponderous bulk toward the adventurers. Its ally, meanwhile, keeps up the pressure on Eecee.

Nerai takes a pretty hard beating, Nerai looks down at her friend, "Oh, did that mean fish creature hurt you? We'll take it out on some of his friends here." She reaches up, and slams the morningstar and the blade into two handy, nearby Murlocs, both weapons connecting, and wounding both pretty bad.

However, the mechanical warrior has been corraled by the murlocs that menace her on all sides, setting her up for a fierce swing by the fourth that takes a sizable gouge out of the metal.

Meanwhile, the murloc archer's crossbow fires twice in rapid succession. Both quarrels plunge into Ezra's cold flesh, the magic on the bolts making the flesh still colder.

Satisfied that the naga witch has been distracted, Ezra turns his attentions to undoing her handiwork. He mutters a few choice phrases; a wave of arcane energy washes over the murloc village, and about half of the stricken fish-creatures begin to regain their senses.

"Die!" howls the smoldering Naga, as she leaps from the back of the turtle and raises her staff. A blast of freezing energy erupts amidst Ezra, Saeren, and Kagarn, pelting them with shards of ice.

"You first," replies Saeren. Her bow screams three times and steam swirls around the fiery weapon. The first shatters in the face of the witch, knocking her flat. The second and third sear the already smouldering archer, nearly flattening him as well.

Howling in rage as their mistress falls, the murlocs swarm again around Eecee, poking their spears at the machine and driving it this way and that.

Kagarn is seriously frostbitten, but decides that dealing with the heavily wounded murloc archer takes priority. His totem raises in the air, and another burst of lightning crackles into existence. The bolt is weaker this time, but more than enough to leave the murloc slumping from the saddle and falling to the sand.

Riderless, the giant turtle turns from the field of battle and crawls back into the ocean; the surviving murlocs howl in despair and continue to swing at the steam armor, apparently fighting to the bitter end.

Nerai watches the Turtle retreat into the sea, She swings the morningstar across to the Murloc on her left, the heavy metal and spiky ball effectively smashing the poor creature to duct. Her blade connects with the other Murloc, but it still seem to manage to keep enough of his insides inside to keep going. She looks at the other two, as only a battle crazed Goblin can.

The awakened murloc villagers pick up their spears and, directed by their chieftain, swarm around the enemy murlocs, seriously wounding one. Meanwhile, despite the best efforts of his allies, the murloc designated to make the killing blow against the mechanical monstrosity fails to do so.

The wounded wizard, having helped dispose of the ringleader of this assault, is almost bored with the remaining rabble. He casually flings a firebolt at one of the murlocs flanking Eecee, slaughtering it in an orgy of flame.

Saeren wastes no time. The first shot blasts right through the eye of a wounded murloc, engulfing its head in flames and leaving little more than a charred stump behind. The second and third slay the last enemy a moment later.

The murloc villagers, deprived of any further targets, turn toward Eecee, spears raised, but the murloc chieftain raises his staff. "Stop!" he calls in Nerglish, then hobbles forward, between his companions. "Do you understand our tongue, land-dwellers?" he continues.

Ezra begins incanting a spell. It's a familiar one, the Reflective Disguise he wore earlier. Thus revealed, he steps forward toward the chief. "I do," he answers.

The murloc peers suspiciously at Ezra. "You are the foreigner that came to us before," he says. "Which is your true form? ...and in either case, why did you attack the invaders?"

"We are," answers the wizard. "My true form is what you saw - the dead wizard. We invaded because my words to you were true. The naga draw on the power of darkness. They wish to use you in their war. The night elves fight back. Now your people live, and the attackers are dead. Is that not what I said?"

The chieftain turns toward the sea, and barks a quick order to 'go get the turtle', and two murlocs leap into the surf and swim after the retreating reptile. The others continue to watch the land-dwellers cautiously. "You have proven at least that you oppose our foes," he says. Around him, the other sleeping murlocs begin to stir fitfully. "But that does not mean you are on our side. Even now you seek to deceive me with your illusion of kinship."

"What is your side?" asks Saeren.

The murloc waits for Ezra's translation, then nods. "Tell the purple-skin that our side is us. We only wish to be left in peace, to serve the sea-spirits, and to see our tadpoles grow unmolested."

"Then goodbye." Ezra turns, waving to his companions to come.

Nerai tries to move Eecee around in the most polite way possible.

Saeren has no trouble leaving, but she makes a point of looting the slain enemies first. Should one of these new not-friends get in her way, the village will be emptied very quickly.

One of the murlocs raises his spear as Saeren approaches, but the chieftain stops him. "The land-dwellers slew the invaders; they have the right to their belongings." He peers at Saeren, then calls to Ezra. "Is that all the purple-skin seeks here?"

"You want peace for your people. You want your children to be safe. You want the gods to be happy with you." Ezra smiles, stopping to turn. "Do you think the night elves are any different?"

The night elf ignores the murlocs for now. She's focused on the fallen witch. As she inspects her she sees something that tenses her quickly. "Kagarn!" hisses Saeren. "She's not dead. We need to try to save her!"

Kagarn comes to Saeren's side, and lays a hand on the naga's shoulder. There is a faint verdant glow. "She will live. Do you wish her conscious, or shall we bring her elsewhere first?"

Nerai looks at the Murlocs, "This is almost certainly not the place. I can carry her..."

"Nerai is right. Just stable for now. We will need to take every care. Ezra's persuasion was just enough to convince Asprah to fight, I think. We cannot fall short." Saeren picks up the naga, then carefully guides her into the much stronger hands of Eecee.

"I came here for her," Saeren says, gesturing to the naga that Nerai carries. "No one deserves to live a slave to another. She will be given her chance at redemption."

The murloc nods to Ezra, as his villagers bring the bridled turtle back to shore. "You live on the land, and you remain there. We live in the sea, and we will remain here. That is the natural order of things. Now go."
