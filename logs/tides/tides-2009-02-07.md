# Turning Tides 2009-02-07

The party moves further inland, out of sight of the murloc village, and restrains their naga captive. Kagarn nods to his companions. "Let me know when you are ready," he rumbles, "and I will attempt to revive her." Hearing this, Asprah quietly slips behind a tree, out of sight of her former kin, her two night elf wardens standing close watch.

Ezra stays well back, crouched down, inspecting the captive with glowing eyes. It's one thing to lure a seemingly willing naga into a benevolent trap, quite another to give the sacrament to an actively hostile one. But the chalice is Saeren's now, and hers to use as she wishes.

Nerai looks on with a confused face. She heard stories from the other two about what happened when they applied one to the other, as it were. However, it is another thing to see it in person. Could this really work?

Saeren looks down at the Naga and then to the filled chalice she holds. "If she's not willing it won't work," she says quietly. "The way to damnation is by traps and deceit. One can only return to the light with their eyes open."

The night elf sighs sadly, then turns to the shaman, "Please wake her."

Kagarn says, "Then let us see which route she will take," he says, laying his hands on the naga's shoulder. The bruised and burned creature of the sea blinks her eyes, then immediately thrashes, once, just long enough to confirm that her hands are securely bound. Her eyes glare hatefully at her captors. "So you are victorious, this time," she hisses.

"No," replies Saeren. "At least, not yet." She leans down before the Naga. "I am Saeren, and whether I win or not is up to you. What is your name?"

The naga eyes Saeren. "What does it matter?" she spits. "Why should I give _you_ anything?"

"If that is your choice." Saeren holds out the chalice, "Then we will go ahead. I offer you a chance for a new life. What some would call redemption and freedom from the hate that binds your will so strongly. If you wish to learn more, open your mouth and drink. If not, I shall ensure you never harm anyone again. It is your choice."

She blinks at the chalice Saeren is holding. "That is one of ours..." she breathes, and then snarls at Saeren, "What have you done to that thing?"

"Aku'mai has fallen. Her essence has been purified," Ezra says quietly. "This will lift the curse of Dagun."

The naga's eyes widen in shock at Ezra's words. "Impossible..." she breathes. Then aloud: "Curse? You call it a curse?" The naga seems outraged. "Bah! Well, I suppose you poor pathetic warmbloods would see it that way." She turns her head away. "You offer me no choice at all," she says bitterly. "Do your worst."

"Die well, thrall," the wizard whispers.

"I hope in the next life you are spared," says Saeren. "Farewell." She aims carefully, but it is not a hard shot, and death, when it comes, is nearly instantaneous.

As the bowstring twangs, Asprah emerges from her hiding place, and sighs. "I fear you will not find so many of my former kin as receptive as I," she says. Moving closer, she sees the face. "Kendrah," she says, reaching down to close her eyes. "I am not surprised. She spoke often of the glory of Dagun."

Saeren sighs gently and reaches out to put a hand on Asprah's shoulder. "I am sorry. I fear that I lack the skill to persuade your kindred. I will keep trying. Even if I fail a thousand times, I will give this choice."

Asprah nods. "Thank you, sister," she says softly.

---

The travelers return to find Auberdine in an uproar. Shops are closing, and night elves - as well as the other residents of the town - are drifting toward the docks. As they enter, one of the gate guards quietly falls into line beside Asprah, while another says to the others, "You have returned. Quickly! You are wanted at the docks!"

"At least we are now wanted somewhere," quips Ezra.

"I've always been wanted here, I suspect," cracks Asprah. "Though I think they'd have preferred dead over alive."

Ezra twirls his cane in one hand, then presses it down firmly to the ground and begins a brisk pace toward the docks.

"They will learn better," says Saeren. She smiles and offers her hand to Asprah. "Unless I miss my guess, something truly wonderful is about to happen. You are going to meet someone who never gave up on me, not even after I had long since thought my case hopeless."

Nerai stares. "It could be worse, of course." She turns to the gate guard, "I suppose you should lead the way."

It is not hard to find the way - just follow the people. There is already a crowd at the water's edge, behind a cordon of sentinels, while a handful of sentinels and dignitaries, including Drusilla, wait just beyond. As the travelers approach, though, the sentinels clear a way for them and insert them into the greeting party.

"You are just in time," Drusilla whispers in her draenic-accented Common. "They tell me the emissary is expected soon. Though it seems they have made rather a fuss over-" She is cut off by a call from the lookout at the end of the quay. "Ship ho!" he calls, to great cheering on the part of the crowd. Saeren's sharp eyes have already noted the speck on the horizon, and soon everyone can see the night elven clipper cruising into the bay of Auberdine, its sails bearing the legend of the Goddess Elune.

The deckhands skillfully catch the lines cast off by the vessel and moor it securely to the dock. Several well-armed guards disembark, and behind them, to even more cheering, is the woman Saeren had expected to see: High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind herself.

The Forsaken wizard doffs his hat, but remains quiet.

The priestess bows before the town's leader. "Greetings, Thundris Windweaver. I trust you are well," she says, moving down the line. "And you must be Drusilla, of the draenei," she says smoothly. "I look forward greatly to meeting your kinsmen." Drusilla curtseys, replying "You are too kind."

Moving down the line, Tyrande acknowledges the others, both local and visitor, with polite nods - though Saeren is favored with a smile as well - until she reaches the heavily guarded Asprah.

Nerai nods her head respectfully.

Saeren returns the smile, wondering just what the High Priestess thinks of the rather unusual companions that she has brought to Auberdine.

The sentinels around Asprah stiffen, as if prepared to protect their beloved leader - who has halted in evident astonishment. "By the light of the Moon," breathes Tyrande. "What manner of being are _you_? Your shape is that of a naga, but..."

Saeren moves to set herself once again at Asprah's side. "High Priestess, your presence graces us. It is my great honor to present to you Asprah, one who has returned from the depths to walk once more in the Light of Elune."

Asprah curtseys gracefully, being sure to keep her hands to herself. "My lady," she says. "I am honored to make your acquaintance, my lady."

Tyrande, for her part, raises a hand to her lips. "Asprah, Asprah..." she murmurs, as if to herself. "It has been so long..." She nods to the former naga. "I remember now. You had been a promising pupil before you chose the route of the Highborne." The priestess turns to Saeren. "Is this the redemption you spoke of?" she says quietly.

Nerai raises an eyebrow at this, but looks between the two.

"Hers and perhaps my own, as well," replies Saeren gently. "I hope my sister will be accepted here. I cannot return where my family is not welcome."

Tyrande looks along the rows of night elf faces watching this exchange. "It may take some time, Saeren," she says softly, noting the skepticism and doubt in the faces of the audience. "But if Asprah and her kin truly repent of the sins of Azshara, I am sure the truth will win out." She nods to Asprah. "You and your kind shall need a new name for your people, for the name of 'naga' no longer suits you..."

Asprah replies, "I have thought on this, my lady. If it please you, I would have my new kind known as the _lamia_ - the Awakened," she adds, translating the name into the common tongue.

"Let it be so," says Tyrande. "Bring the visitors to my residence," she adds, addressing the sentinels. "We have much to discuss."

---

It is roughly an hour before Tyrande returns to the residence. "I apologize for keeping you waiting," she says to the visitors. "There are so many people here who would be offended if I put outlanders ahead of them." She nods to Asprah and Ezra. "Especially those who are hated and feared by my fellows."

Ezra laughs unpleasantly.

"We are grateful for your time, High Priestess," says Saeren. "And honestly, it is a surprise that anyone still has the will to invest time with someone like me." The night elf goes on to quip, "My companions are the ones in bad company."

Nerai shrugs. "I find company is less about race, and more about personality. There are many of my own race I would hesitate to spend any time talking to."

Tyrande smiles warmly. "I have never lost faith in you, Saeren. Even when you took the name of Finblighter and sought to dissolve your grief in vengeance." She regards Nerai, and laughs. "I sometimes feel the same way myself - though for the sake of Elune don't speak of that to anyone else."

Nerai laughs at this, "It would hardly matter if I did, I think..."

Tyrande nods to Asprah. "So... how did your salvation come about? It had never occurred to us that anything like this was possible..."

Saeren holds forth the answer, "This is important to the story," she explains. The purified chalice is offered to Tyrande, "By the devices of the enemy and the blessing of a Titan Dagun's Curse may be shattered... in those who are willing."

"We became aware of a summoned minion of Dagun, one of the Old Gods which the Titans buried," explains Ezra, beginning to tell the tale. "With the help of the Earthen Ring, we entered Black Fathom Deeps...." He spins out the story slowly, recalling to his companions' minds the fights they fought, but placing it in its proper arcane context.

In the beginning, the Titans came to Azeroth. They ordered the chaotic world they found, placing guardians such as the earthen and the Dragon Aspects in charge when they departed. Part of this ordering involved the destruction of creatures such as that now buried at the Master's Glaive.

The Old Gods were laid to a fitful rest - they and their servants. But one of these Old Gods, Dagun, has recently become more active. Whether this was due to the naga's influence, or whether their war became possible because of it, Ezra can't say. But he is ultimately the power behind the proposed invasion of dry land. To that end, the naga and their minions within the Twilight's Hammer brought forth a servant of Dagun, named Aku'mai. The Earthen Ring and the naga hunters captured Aku'mai's essence, and with the power of the chalice and a Titan's blessing, made it possible for the chalices which corrupted people to Dagun to do the reverse.

"Ssuch artifactss are now rare and valuable. Ssaeren is custodian of the only one now exissting," finishes Ezra. "But we sshall need to make more."

Nerai reaches behind her, and produces the less good version of the Chalice, and proffers it for Tyrande. "This, would be one that they use. The one that was used on many peoples..."

Tyrande's brow wrinkles as she touches the rim of the tainted chalice. "So this is one of the dreaded chalices of the naga," she says. "Asprah, do you have any idea how these things are made?"

"Very little, my lady," replies the lamia. "I know that the high priestesses of the tides were involved, but the secrets of their creation are only known to a handful." Asprah smiles faintly. "I think they had come to suspect my faithlessness, even perhaps before I did."

Nerai looks over at Asprah. "How many of you do you think were.. beginning to suspect their faithlessness, Asprah?"

Asprah rubs her forehead. "I... there were a few in Mathystra who seemed dissatisfied. But it is hard to tell which ones were uncertain about the path we were taking and which merely thought they deserved a better place within it."

Nerai nods at Asprah.

Tyrande rubs her chin. "I would venture to guess that the more... _faithful_ of their kind would mercilessly slaughter any who were caught seeking out the blessing of the Titans. But even so, we will need more than one chalice if we hope to rescue even all the naga that would seek to be rescued." She looks up at Drusilla. "Perhaps your people could help?"

Drusilla nods her head. "The naga are a great threat to us too, both here and in Outland. Anything that would reduce their threat-" "Outland?" interrupts Tyrande. "The naga are in Outland?"

Drusilla nods. "They invaded some years ago, along with the blood elves."

Tyrande looks downcast. "So that is what came of them after. Illidan..." She sighs. "I wonder what they seek to accomplish there."

"The naga are also on your very shores, madam," murmurs Ezra. "On everyone's."

"True," replies Tyrande. "We must deal with the threat that is close to hand before we can hope to reach further. I only hope Fandral Staghelm will allow it." She stands. "We will have more time to talk on the voyage to Azuremyst Isle. And hopefully..." Her hand brushes the rim of the chalice of purification. "Hopefully I can begin to learn the secrets of creating a twin to this."

---

The travelers are awakened the next day, to prepare for the voyage to Azuremyst. Thundris is present for the send-off. "Thank you for visiting our fair city," he says to the travelers. But Tyrande has some business for him.

"Send your farstrider sentinels to the outskirts of Mathystra, to spy upon the naga," she instructs. "There is a threat brewing there, and I wish to know what chance we have to put a stop to it." Windweaver bows. "It will be done, my lady." He glances at Ezra and Asprah. "Are you sure it is safe to travel with..." He trails off, and Tyrande simply smiles. "You need not fear for my safety from such as they, my friend."

Ezra tips his hat politely to Thundris.

Nerai just beams a wide grin.

Likewise, Asprah bows graciously. As with the others, she knows full well that not all night elves will accept her redemption right away. Kagarn, for his part, merely snorts.

Saeren grins at Kagarn, patting his elbow. "I think the High Priestess is quite able to counter any fumbling we might do," she adds helpfully.

Nerai talks to Wizbang, as they prepare the armor for it's journey stowed in the hold. "Hopefully I'll pass through again soon." She smiles as she carefully ties Eecee down to the wagon, making sure the frame is secured in the wagon firmly, and the wagon in the ship. "Thanks for you help getting him set." The toil is quick, and Eecee, along with all the spare parts and tools Nerai needs to keep such an armor running are soon stowed.

The wagon is towed aboard, along with the additional provisions the _Elune's Blessing_ requires for the voyage to Azuremyst. These preparations are handled smoothly, and, once again, a cheering crowd is present to watch Tyrande's departure. The vessel casts off from Auberdine, and the sails catch the wind, sending the swift hull across the water, the sun pursuing at its back.
