# Turning Tides 2009-03-14

As the _Elune's Blessing_ gets underway, Tyrande leads her traveling companions below deck. "Allow me to introduce you to my bodyguards for this voyage," she says, favoring Saeren with a smile. "Though in a few cases, an introduction will not be necessary."

The high priestess opens the door to her cabin, and two night elf women are inside, both in chainmail - one wearing the livery of the sentinels, and the other marked as a priestess of Elune. It is the latter that rises to her feet in astonishment. "Saeren? Is that you?"

Saeren isn't entirely sure what to make of the threat (?) of familiarity at first, but is curiously pleased by who she sees. "Belana Moonshadow," she says with a most uncharacteristic warmth. "It has been some time. Still doing your best to save the world?" she asks with more than a hint of teasing.

Belana laughs. "I do my small part," she says, to which her companion raises an eyebrow but says nothing. "But what of you, Saeren?" asks Belana. "I trust you are... well?" Her tone is guarded, careful, fearful of opening old wounds.

Saeren looks to Tyrande for a moment, then back to Belana. "I'm getting better," she says at last. She takes a few steps and extends her hands, "I'm relieved to have a few people receive me with joy, honestly. I didn't expect it."

Belana smiles again, and takes Saeren's hands in hers. "I am glad to hear of it," she says. "It has been a long time." She turns. "Allow me to introduce you to my traveling companion of late. Elyssa Nightbreeze." The other night elf stands and bows formally. "Pleased to meet you," says the sentinel, almost in a whisper.

Saeren bows in return, "I hope you are keeping Belana out of harm's way." Though the archer rather doubts it's entirely possible. "But if not, I have a feeling you're able to get her home again." She rather likes Elyssa already.

Tyrande smiles as she watches the reunion, then interjects, "And these are the rest of our fellow travelers on this voyage. Drusilla... Nerai... Ezra... and Asprah." This time, the reactions are less positive, ranging from astonishment at the draenei, to dismay at the goblin, to outright hostility at the Forsaken. By the time the lamia enters, Elyssa is reaching for her bow, while Belana is fingering the handle of the moonglaive at her belt.

Ezra merely tips his hat in a polite gesture.

By the time Tyrande introduces Kagarn, a tauren is an anticlimax. He kneels with respect. "Greetings," he says in his deep voice, and raises a massive eyebrow of his own, noting the wary posture of Tyrande's bodyguards. "I suppose we must strike you as... rather a motley crew."

Belana manages to relax somewhat. "That is an understatement, sir," she replies. "I suppose Lady Whisperwind knows what she is doing, but... this is a bit much. There must be quite a long story indeed, to explain all this. Especially... Asprah, was it?" she says, inclining her head with stiffly formal politeness to the lamia.

Saeren moves over to Asprah's side and reaches out to rest a hand on her back. "She and this.. motley crew are why I'm getting better."

Nerai, for her part, is glad we're not under arrest, or confined to quarters, or asked to leave. She bows, almost overly formally.

Saeren's announcement has Belana nearly speechless. "You? Friends with a _naga_?" she says to Saeren in abject astonishment. Tyrande interjects. "She is a lamia, Belana. The curse of the Old Gods has been lifted from her. It is because this is possible that Saeren's healing has begun."

"I believe you had told me in the past of the need to move on and forget the hatred and sadness," says Saeren. "That has been impossible for me. However, there is hope now that the past can be healed and my old wound will be reduced to an ugly scar. Asprah is not just a friend. She is alone in this world, so I stand now as her sister, as long as she wishes it."

Belana nods slowly. "So that is the way of it," she says. "But how did this come to be?"

The long tale is told, starting with the first chalice found at Tiragarde Keep, through the purification at Master's Glaive, to its first use outside the ruins of Ameth'Aran. Elyssa is silent throughout the exchange, but Belana asks many questions.

And at the end, she has one more question. "If these chalices bear the taint of the Old God of the sea, then why would the naga bring one with them when they attack a murloc village?"

"Cursing the surface dwellers and bringing them under Dagun's rule is their strategy, yes," explains Ezra. "Either they ssimply carry them for convenience, or... they usse them for more..eh, recaltricant murloc villagess."

"As was the village you encountered," Belana agrees. "But this does mean that not all-" She is interrupted by a cry from above deck. "MURLOCS!" call the night elf voices - and Elyssa frowns as she notes the touch of panic in those voices. Even those of the younger sentinels standing guard abovedecks.

Saeren sighs at the shout. "Well, I guess I don't need so many arrows," she decides aloud. She leads the charge. Assuming someone follows her. In any case, she's heading out to fight.

Nerai jumps on hearing the cry. First off the thinks that someone is just overreacting to their conversation. THen she looks up on deck. SHe stumbles up the stairs quickly, followed by The Forsakes, the Tauren, and at least one of the Night Elves.

Ezra tips his hat again. "Ladies," he says, then follows his companions.

Tyrande says, "We will remain down here for now. Call for me if the danger is too great." Her bodyguards take up station beside her, as the adventurers return abovedecks.

Nothing but ocean is visible in all directions - the _Elune's Blessing_ has passed out of sight of Auberdine's lighthouses. Nothing, that is, but ocean and nearly a score of murlocs.

Saeren is dazed for a heart beat. "Sweet bliss," she breathes out. Three arrows seem to go directly from her quiver into one of the nearest murlocs. The creature is left to float uselessly in the waters, a little flame flicking at its flesh greedily and going out as a wave rushes over.

Her junior colleague fires as well, but to rather less effect, the arrow splashing into the water beside the nearest murloc - as one of the fishmen swims up to the edge of the boat. Those nearby can hear the scrabbling of claws against wood.

Nerai runs over to Eecee and climbs in. The Goblin can be seen adjusting various straps, oiling various joints, and generally doing that preflight thing.

The rest of the night elven defenders fire upon the invading murlocs, the two on the starboard side managing to score solid hits on one of them. Meanwhile, another murloc manages to get under the cover of the ship's railing and begins its own struggle out of the water.

Kagarn raises his totem and begins a prayer to the spirits of the air. As he completes the incantation, everyone feels their skin begin to tingle with electricity - and a bolt from the blue arcs down and incinerates one of the murlocs, the sea around it crackling briefly.

More murlocs swim toward the _Elune's Blessing_ and disappear under the bow. Four of them emerge on the starboard side, their eyes glinting red.

Ezra claps two hands together, steepling two pairs of fingers and muttering an adjuration in Kalimag. A geyser of water erupts from nothingness, shaping itself rapidly into an elemental of water.

The elemental immediately tries to attack one of the boarding murlocs, but is as yet disoriented from its transition from the Elemental Plane.

The rest of the surviving murlocs swim up to the edge of the vessel, and scrabbling can be heard from all sides. At least one of them manages to reach the railing, reaching for its spear even as it throws a dripping webbed foot over the side.

Watching the situation, Ezra realizes the danger - and the opportunity. "Starboard sentinels, move to port!" he bellows.

Saeren spins about, firing three arrows swiftly at the emerging murlocs on the starboard. Two are buried in one target, leaving it on the brink of judgement while the last shot flies wide.

One of the port-side sentinels, having seen the wave of murlocs apprach, falls back beside Saeren and strikes the leading murloc with an arrow, while another fishman emerges beside the first and leaps for her compatriot, swinging wildly with its trident.

Nerai uses her clawed foot to kick Eecee's frame, "Come on guy, come on..." She encourages, as she billows some of the phlogiston. "The guys need us..." As she gets the proper amount of the gas billowed into the boiler. She presses the red button, her clawed foot mashing gown on one of the pedals. Unfortunatly, trying to push the enginge that hard makes Eecee flood, the boiler splorts, but doesn't roll over like it should. Nerai curses, and reaches over, pulling on the bladder to bleed out the gas and try again.

The archers forward retreat from the murloc assault, firing as they go. Elune smiles on them; one manages to seriously wound her target, while the other finishes what Saeren had started, sending the creature pitching over the edge. To the rear, another murloc emerges over the edge. Ignoring the smoking machine, it makes directly for the defenders.

Kagarn, deciding that the defense of the _Elune's Blessing_ is well in hand for now, moves past Ezra and grants Saeren the blessing of the spirits. The familiar battle lust rises in her, as Kagarn nods approvingly.

The murlocs continue to swarm over the deck, one of them managing to catch a retreating sentinel with its trident. As one of them makes for Kagarn, though, they cannot help but notice its hide is bruised, apparently by a blow the elemental struck as the murloc clambered over the side.

While his elemental splashes across the ship's deck to put paid to a murloc near Kagarn, Ezra deftly sidesteps his own attacker and lets loose with a volley of arcane missiles. They streak toward a murloc assaulting the sentinel aft, then split off to wound its nearest companions.

More murlocs emerge over the decks - nearly all of them accounted for by now - and charge after the defenders. The sentinels fight back, but some of them are wounded by the murlocs' weapons.

Seeing her people hurt by the murlocs is enough to make Saeren's blood boil. Having the spirits grant her their hunger for battle sends her beyond the brink. She lets out a horrific roar and strides away from the nearest enemy only to incinerate a murloc on the starboard side. She then wheels around and directs her wrath at yet another foe. Two more strikes and a perfectly good murloc corpse is produced, but it's clear that she's only whetting her ravenous appetite.

Unable to get clear of the attacking murlocs, one of the junior sentinels instead moves to interpose herself between Saeren and the attackers, drawing a dagger and swinging at the most wounded murloc but failing to connect. The attackers fare a little better, one of them circling around to stab a night elf with its trident.

Nerai moves to intercede herself between the two closest Murlocs, then, taking a swing at the creatures, she slips her attack. Her sword falls wide of it's mark, but the Morning Star connects true.

The sentinels continue to fall back, taking a few more hits, but scoring a few of their own. One of them, moving to prevent the murlocs from getting into melee with the unarmored Forsaken, is able to slice a finger off the murloc she attacks in return, while another manages to extricate herself from melee and send an arrow into her attacker's gut.

Kagarn swivels as the nearest sentinel cries out in pain, and utters a brief chant to the spirits. The electricity in the air crackles, and another bolt launches down from the sky, severely burning the murloc.

The murlocs continue to press the attack - avoiding the heavily armored Eecee in favor of softer targets. One mortally wounded murloc spends its last breath in seriously wounding one of the defending sentinels.

While Ezra's elemental keeps his opponent busy, his chants send three more murlocs to death's door or beyond courtesy of arcane missiles.

The murlocs continue to advance. Two of them manage to close with Ezra, recognizing him as the source of the sizzling purple bolts that are slaying its companions, but luck is not with them as their tridents do little more than superficial damage. One of the defenders is not so lucky; she is seriously wounded by a final strike and falls to the deck, unconscious and bleeding.

Saeren's bow seems to somehow pick up the fires of her wrath. The first shot rips into the skull of a murloc and explodes in fire. The next shot permenantly silences yet another murloc, and the last turns a third murloc into a torch that burns bright for just a moment, then collapses to the deck, smouldering.

Nerai wheels the machine of death around as one of her targets disengages. FOcussing her attentions on the Murloc who escaped her sword last round, she chops fiercely at it, dropping his body to the deck. Eecee steps on the Murloc's lifeless body, moving himself between the Sentinel and the charging fish creature.

The sentinels, seeing the tide of battle turn to their advantage, regroup and begin firing their bows again. They cannot keep up with Saeren, but they can certainly manage to put some arrows in the attacking murlocs.

Now free of murlocs assaulting him, Kagarn is free to turn the healing power of the spirits upon one of his night elf allies. Refreshed, she draws her bow and fires, but the pain of the wounds is too great yet and her shot goes wide.

Ezra has had enough of these Dagun-loving murlocs on this Dagun-loving ship. He takes a step down the stairs - the only place he can go - and ignites one of the nearby murlocs in a spectacular pyrotechnic show, while his elemental rushes off to investigate one of the other creatures spotted earlier.

The surviving murlocs have had enough. Throwing down their weapons, they gargle in their strange dialect - though Ezra is not familiar with it, it sounds suspiciously like the Nerglish for 'retreat!' - and jump over the side of the vessel with a loud splash. Apparently overhearing the cry, the murloc that had been late to the party likewise gives up and makes for the open ocean.

Saeren isn't about to let them run off without payment. The clumsiest of the murlocs collects two arrows and gets a one way trip to the endless depths. "Filth," she growls softly, before turning away again. "Is everyone okay? Make sure to check the side of the ship. They are stupid, but they may have tried something clever."

It seems that the only cleverness the murlocs have in mind is survival. As Saeren moves to the starboard railing, she can see the trails of blood left by the two wounded murlocs, and she can even see the ripples of their passage. The murloc assault on the _Elune's Blessing_ has been thwarted.

"Once the wounded ssentinels are tended, Kagarn... will you bring 'round one of the murlocs?" Ezra asks, tapping his chin.

Nerai busies herself dragging Murloc bodies as directed, probably dumping them in the brink unless anyone objects. After she's helped clean up, she drives Eecee over to the head of the stairs, and idles down.

"I will tend to our wounded, says a voice from below. Belana emerges and begins to call upon the power of Elune to heal her compatriots, while Kagarn kneels beside a gasping murloc and brings it back from death's door. The creature rolls its eyes, its pupils slitted with fear and rage, and gurgles under its breath, still too weak to resist.

Once the murloc is secured, Ezra casts a short spell and kneels down next to the mast where it's been tied up. "Why did you attack uss?" he asks in Nerglish, translating for the benefit of his companions.

The murloc glares at Ezra and shakes its head, saying nothing. Only its thoughts respond to Ezra's question; it was ordered by some naga female to slaughter the crew of the next ship they saw, then steer the ship to drift to shore within sight of the nearest elven port.

Nerai looks up as Ezra translates. "We're getting famous."

"Not if they thought these maggots could destroy us," replies Saeren.

"So it was them," says Elyssa the sentinel, as she too emerges on deck to look at the slaughtered murlocs. She says no more, leaving it to Belana to explain. "For the past month or so, every so often, one of our ships has run aground near a village, all its crew murdered and its cargo missing. We had no idea who was responsible until now - either a ship made it to port unmolested, or fell victim."

"Yess.." Ezra hums. "Where iss your tribe? On the coast, or at ssea?" he asks of the murloc.

The murloc growls angrily at Ezra, and continues to withhold its tongue. But its thoughts betray a home deep beneath the waves.

The wizard considers further. "The naga would ssend you to your deathss, yess. Look around you, creature. Those of your tribe who lisstened to the naga witchess are now slain. And what have they ever done for you, except threaten?"

The murloc's thoughts in response are all prayers to the glory of Dagun. All, that is, except one. For just the slightest fraction of a second, Ezra catches a memory of a time when the murloc lived in peace, before the naga came. Only for a moment does the thought last, and then the memory is buried deep, beyond the reach of Ezra's magic.

The Forsaken has found what he wished. "I am going to sset you free," he says, then repeats this for the others before continuing. "You musst tell your people this in return for your life: the elvess have never come to your home and ordered you into battle. The naga have. Conssider carefully who you prefer as neighborss."

The murloc cackles in its nasty gurgling way at the news that it will be set free, and its thoughts are full of the conquest of the land in Dagun's name that it will now live to see. And... once again, there is one brief thought that dissents. The thought is simple: _Help me._

Ezra thinks a moment. "Ssaeren. The chalice. Offer him a drink?"

As Saeren approaches with the chalice of purification, the murloc begins to struggle, but the sentinels move to restrain it more securely. The cleansing liquid is forced down the creature's throat, and it thrashes, gurgling, and uttering a blood-curdling scream. Ezra's mind is still in touch, and he can _see_ the thoughts of Dagun recoil in terror, then scatter to shreds and blow away in the wind of the titans' blessing.

The murloc opens its eyes, and the red glint is gone. It speaks. "I don't know who you are... but thank you."

Ezra watches the process impassively. "We will free your tribe if you wissh. Those that can be. If not, you may do something else. The choice is yours," he says at last.

"That will not be easy," says the murloc. "We live deep below the sea, not far from Nazjatar. The tribes of naga would surely fight to prevent you, and they are very powerful now. But... if you are willing, we would be eternally grateful."

"What can be done will be," Ezra promises. He rises, turning away, walking across the deck in silence to stare out at the sea.

The murloc looks around, counting. Finally, it turns to Saeren. "Did any of my tribesmen escape your wrath?" it asks, still in Nerglish.

The murloc shakes its head in dismay. "You are still in danger. The survivors will report to our masters. They will tell of what powers they faced. And our masters will send a force they deem capable of defeating you. They do not wish anyone to learn that we are behind these raids."

"That will ssave us the trouble of going to your tribe, to purify them," Ezra says over his shoulder.

Nerai looks between the two, "Assuming they last that long, that is..."

Elyssa speaks up. "Then we are needed." Belana nods in agreement. "Whatever the naga send at us next, they were not aware that Elyssa and I also sail with you. It seems that it was fortunate that we did not commit all our forces from the outset."

Kagarn looks down below. "And what of Tyrande Whisperwind?" Her answer comes from the foot of the stairs. "You must keep me in reserve. If the naga discover I am on this vessel, they will send everything they can find to bring us down. I do not know if they could succeed, but it would be very dangerous to let them try."

Belana says, "As you wish, my lady." She nods to Saeren, surveying the deck. "It will be good to fight alongside you again, after all these centuries. I see your skills have grown since then. I am glad; we will need them."
