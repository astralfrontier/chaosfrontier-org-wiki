# Turning Tides 2009-03-28

In the wake of the initial attack, Ezra peers over the side of the boat. "Why not jusst sink uss?" he wonders aloud.

The murloc that they had 'captured', and then liberated, has an answer to that, once the question is put to him. "We were told _not_ to sink the ship. If we sunk the ship, no one would know what happened to it. We were told we had to make sure the ship returned, just with no one alive."

"Very well." The wizard thinks a moment. "I propose a barrier, yess. Raisse the railing, extend it out over the water on the starboard sside. If the murlocss try to find purchasse, they will fail. We should have adequate lumber and provisionss for this. Nerai?"

Nerai ponders this for a second. :If we had some nets, I cound fashion some caltrops, or hooks to it, and we could attach them to the top of the railing in such a way that they break off when they are grabbed...

The shipmaster is summoned, and peers skeptically at the sketches Nerai is drawing. "We have the lumber for this," says the night elf. "And canvas and rope. But I don't like it. This is going to make the _Elune's Blessing_ unwieldy in the water, and should her hull be damaged, we will have to dismantle it before we can repair."

"You're right, of coursse," Ezra replies, sighing dejectedly. "Besst to ssacrifice the passengerss in the name of the ship."

The shipmaster narrows her eyes. "Yes, it's a good thing the passengers can swim for the next three hundred miles, or do not need to breathe if they cannot." She peers at the plans again. "I take your point though, Forsaken. We must balance one risk against the other."

Nerai is already off, looking for nets, and digging through her scraps for metal and other pieces she's going to need. According to narrative imperative, a spring bounces out of the wagon, "Ah! I'll need this."

Nerai starts off to work, her hammer and spanner singing as she makes little sharp hooks and wires them into the net. As She directs several somewhat willing volunteers in creating an overhang on the side of the ship, she spreads the nets out, attacking mechanisms on the top to enable the release characteristics.

While Nerai works on building her makeshift barricade, the rest of the ship's defenders prepare for battle. Saeren takes the crow's nest, along with two of the junior sentinels; the other two are posted near the barricades, prepared to deal with any murlocs that might attempt to challenge Nerai's handiwork.

Elyssa and Belana stay on deck, with Belana prepared to ensure Elyssa's own archerywork suffers no interference. Eecee is left on deck as well, ready for Nerai to board it as soon as her work is done.

Less than an hour after Nerai's booby trap is in place, Saeren sees something. Far behind them - nearly 400 feet back - she sees the head of a threshadon. Wildlife would not concern her, but that the ripples behind it do not move as they should; it seems as if there is something attached to the threshadon's back.

Saeren signals those below immediately. "Threshodon chasing us down. It's a big one and it appears to have a cargo!" It's not likely to be friendly.

As he begins casting his defensive magics, Ezra glances over at Nerai. "Sstay with the group," he advises. "To protect uss. And to sstay out of the effectss of magic."

Saeren takes aim carefully, but her eagerness to fire causes her to fumble the first arrow, and it falls harmlessly to the deck below. Unphased, two more shots are fired from the fiery bow and strike home.

The creature writhes in pain, the arrows smoldering where it struck; a fraction of a second later, they can hear the trumpeting cry. A moment later, it rises out of the water, and they can see that the creature is indeed wearing some sort of howdah, with slanted wooden sides. And sitting in front of the howdah, holding the reins... is a murloc. Even at this distance, Saeren can see that it is wearing the same sort of ornamentation as the crossbowman they encountered on the beaches of Darkshore.

The murloc draws a crossbow and returns fire. At this range, it is not as precise as Saeren's, but it is good enough that one of the bolts nicks her shoulder, and she feels the bite of frost magic.

Saeren's companions return fire. Despite the great distance, they are still kaldorei sentinels, and Saeren would swear that at least one arrow found its mark, only to be turned by the metal armor the murloc is wearing.

Saeren does not take to the wound kindly. Her very first return shot is a brutal strike that sends the enemy reeling, and the next two shots put the creature in serious danger. "Finish it," she whispers to the other archers.

The archers continue to fire on the murloc, to little effect; the threshadon draws closer, and the murloc returns fire to little more. Then, behind him, emerging from the howdah, another murloc begins to chant, raising a painted stick high in the air... and a thick cloud of fog obscures the crow's nest.

A rather creative idea of what to do with the murloc bodies after the fight not withstanding, Saeren directs herself down the rope ladder, taking care to put the mast between her and trouble. "Lots of problems coming! More murloc casters behind the first threshadon."

The sentinels, having little more ability to deal with the fog cloud than Saeren, follow her down the rope ladder. Meanwhile, the dinosaur is steered alongside the vessel, and they can hear curses in Nerglish as they approach the only gap in the goblin barricade.

Belana Moonshadow draws her moonglaive and points it at the murloc waverider. "The curse of Elune upon you!" she cries, and a dark mist briefly envelops the murloc at the reins. But on this occasion, Dagun prevails; the murloc swerves out of the saddle and avoids the spell neatly.

And the spirits of air fare little better. Kagarn utters a brief prayer in Taru-ahe, but one of the murlocs on the threshadon's back replies in Nerglish. Kagarn is rocked by the earth spirits he has so often called upon his foes, and his spell is disrupted.

Flying out over the decks to deliver his own attack, Ezra meets the same fate, losing his spell in the process.

The waverider, spotting a flying Forsaken appear over the barricade, reacts accordingly, opening fire with his own bow. The first shot bites into Ezra's undead flesh, though the second glances off the mage's frost armor.

Where magic fails, physical force succeeds. Elyssa steps around the boat's stairwell and lets fly with her own bow. One of the arrows strikes the murloc soundly, biting deep into its flesh and chilling it at the same time.

The murlocs aboard the threshadon not yet in a position to fight, content themselves with summoning more fog to cover their ascent. But this is not all that the servants of the Old God have to offer.

Off to the stern, a fountain of water emerges from the sea, coalescing into the shape of a huge, vaguely humanoid tower of water - a water elemental. And atop its back is a male naga, wearing chainmail and bearing a trident. "Dagun take you all!" he cries, and begins to chant in an odd amalgam of Nazja and Kalimag...

Kagarn, however, calls out, "Not so fast!" He raises his totem, and the magic that was used to such great effect against himself and Ezra proves just as effective against the naga. The denizen of Dagun finds his chanting disrupted by the blow of the earth spirits, and reverts to cursing freely in his native tongue.

Saeren hits the deck with a thud, firing off a quick shot. She scores another hit, injuring the newest spell-casting threat. "They must have half the damn village here," she growls.

The other four sentinels move toward the aft, firing upon the naga as well. Unlike Saeren, though, their skills are not adequate to penetrate the naga's chainmail or its tough skin.

Nerai moves Eecee out of the fog, off to the side where Ezra is. Closer to Ezra is good.

Belana, seeing the new threat, utters a prayer to Elune. "Sentinels, to me!" she calls, moving aft to join her compatriots, though she still remains near enough for Elyssa and Saeren to gain the benefit of Elune's blessing.

Kagarn turns to the naga. "The spirits will destroy you!" he calls, and begins to chant - only to have the naga raise his arm and disrupt Kagarn's magic with an earth shock of his own. Grinning, the naga replies, "You first."

Getting frustrated with the slippery naga, Ezra wheels in midair and shouts an invocation. A rippling scream of sonic energy flies at the distant naga, shattering the sounds of the ocean around it.

The threshadon slips back, out of the fog cloud, and its rider opens fire on Ezra, a crossbow quarrel piercing his throat. It does little more damage than if it had pierced his thigh, but that is bad enough.

Elyssa strides to the side of the deck. "Die," she whispers, and shoots the murloc perched on the threshadon's neck. Uncharacteristically, it seems to obey, slumping sideways in its saddle. Methodically, she turns her fire to the murlocs in their howdah, managing to seriously wound one of them.

The surviving murlocs open fire on the exposed mage, filling his undead flesh with crossbow bolts. They are not as potent as that of their leader, but they are enough. Ezra's eyes lose their corpselight glow, and he splashes into the water.

"Take me close!" calls the naga in Kalimag, and the water elemental swims closer to the boat. He draws up his hand, and the form of a magical totem begins to coalesce there - only to be scattered when Kagarn subjects the naga to yet another earth shock.

The water elemental is more than just a mount, though. It raises a hand at Elyssa, and a stream of water splashes past her and onto the deck, sending splinters flying.

TidesGM says, "'and that hits."

Saeren fires three shots, the first skewers the naga, the second tears into a maimed murloc, and the third flies wide. The hunger for death is still burning quite hot in the night elf's mind.

Belana attempts to invoke the curse of the Moon upon the water elemental, but the murloc allies manage to prevent it. Kagarn is luckier, sending a blast of lightning coursing through murloc and threshadon alike.

And this is finally too much for the threshadon, with no rider to command it. It begins to swim away from the battle, the murlocs aboard squealing in dismay.

The elemental shows no sign of retreat, however. When its rider fell, it only appeared to get angrier, and is clearly preparing to strike back. Elyssa decides to strike first, launching a fusillade of arrows at the water spirit; one of them strikes, and there is a splash as a chunk of frozen water is torn from its side and lands in the ocean below.

The murlocs aboard the threshadon make no attempt to jump free; they can see that the tide of battle turns against them. Nevertheless, they do attempt a salvo of parting shots, one of which strikes Elyssa a grazing blow.

The sea spray remains unafraid. "You will pay," it rumbles in Kalimag, and directs another stream of water at Elyssa. This one strikes home, bruising her, and she is almost knocked over, but manages to stand in the face of the attack.

Saeren fires three times at the only remaining enemy. Her first arrow strikes home, and a chunk of the elemental is converted neatly into steam. The other two shots simply can't find the mark of this rather unusual opponent.

The sentinels open fire on the elemental, but it is too powerful, and even their best attacks barely scratch it. "Fall back!" calls Belana, and they take cover inside the fog cloud alongside Eecee.

A third time Belana seeks to cast Elune's disfavor on a foe; and this time it fails, not because of the earth spirits, but because the water elemental is so quick to dodge.

Kagarn fares rather better. Luck is not with the creature of the sea this time, and a burst of lightning sets a noticeable part of its flesh to boiling. Its roar of pain is like a tsunami crashing into the beach.

Elyssa's bowstring sings as she plunges even more arrows into the creature's watery flesh. Her blows are so powerful that the elemental's retaliatory strike goes wide, sending more watery splinters into the air.

The dead shot keeps up the pace, though she's not quite as effective as her ally. Only one shot finds the target, and the blow does little more than annoy an already quite miffed elemental.

Belana is a priestess of war, but she is much better against enemies that she can attack hand-to-hand. She does not do so well against targets at a distance, and once again Elune's power fails to smite the creature.

Kagarn does rather better. Once more the spirits heed his call, searing the elemental with lightning; it manages to avoid some of the blast, but more clouds of steam erupt from it.

Elyssa, likewise, trades fire with the creature; it seems to have fixated on her as its nemesis, and although her shots strike true, so do its.

Saeren moves slowly closer, but her fortune only grows worse, as all three shots go wide.

The fog cloud finally dissipates, and the archers form a line, opening fire on the elemental, to little effect.

But without the naga or the murloc thresadon-rider, the battle can only go one way. The elemental continues to subject Elyssa to a barrage of water, but Belana and Kagarn are standing by to heal whatever it does, while Elyssa and Saeren pepper it with arrows. At long last, the elemental collapses, its bracers - and its dead naga rider - splashing into the water.

As the creature finally falls, Kagarn leaps off the side, calling upon the spirits to aid his steps. He runs across the waves, eventually reaching Ezra's body where it bobs in the water, and brings it back solemnly. "It is not fit that we leave him to the waves. I know the custom aboard ship is burial at sea, but after all he has done, I would not leave him."

"It will not end here," says Saeren angrily. "He has done too much for my people to be left like this."

"I agree, brave Saeren," says a voice from the stairwell. Tyrande glides out, and leans over the edge to accept Ezra's body from Kagarn. "I do not know what the power of the Moon can do for one of his kind... but I would like to try." She pauses, and turns to the others. "But this is not an easy thing to accomplish, and Elune demands a price of service from those whom she would save."

Nerai looks around, "He has done more for many people than most who now walk this plane." She shakes her head...

The High Priestess smiles. "But I do not think you will find this price onerous. Will you three, on behalf of Ezra L. Pyreborn, swear that in the name of Elune, you will devote all your efforts, all your energies, to saving Azeroth from the scourge of the Old God?"

Nerai nods her head. "I do. Of course, I'm not sure you could stop him if you tried...."

"Done," says Saeren. "Even if Ezra is restored I consider this a new price for the Cursed One to pay."

Kagarn smiles gently and drops to one knee. "I too will so swear."

Tyrande nods, and brings Ezra's body reverently belowdecks. "O Elune, mistress of the night, hear my prayer," she begins. "This soul, Ezra L. Pyreborn, has turned away from the service of the Lich King to take up the cause of the living. I beseech you, do not Forsake him, as his kinsmen proverbially had done..."

---

The ritual ends. Tyrande watches the corpse carefully. She had half expected to watch his burns mend before her eyes, his barely rotted flesh knit back into vitality; she had half feared that Elune would simply fail to grant him life at all. Instead, though his body is unchanged, his eyes open, the pale green light restored as it had been before.

Ezra gurgles. Words form in his throat. "Back again," he croaks. But his voice changes. For a few moments it lacks the sibilants of the undead abomination he became. He sounds human, and ancient, and exhausted beyond measure. "I almost remembered them. I almost got to go with them. Damn you. Damn you all..." And with that he passes out.
