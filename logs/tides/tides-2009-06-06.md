# Turning Tides 2009-06-06

After the conflict at the ford, Ammen Vale itself is fairly peaceful. Mostly. The verdant beauty of the valley is marred somewhat by wreckage, some of it glowing in odd colors, and mostly by a tall, streamlined-looking structure, which surely was not meant to rest on the ground in quite the way that it does.

As the party approaches the structure, which Naarya identifies as a 'life pod', a small band of armed draenei emerges. "Naarya! What news of the siege-" begins the leader, then blinks. "You've recovered Drusilla! Then the news is good?" He then catches sight of the other companions, and pauses thoughtfully.

Naarya bows. "Vindicator Aldar," he says. "These are four natives of this world. It was they who broke the siege, and turned our captors into their captives." Three male naga, shorn of their armor, as well as their female leader, follow them, with Saeren and Asprah standing guard over them. "May I introduce Saeren, of the night elves; Kagarn, of the tauren; Nerai, of the goblins; and Ezra, who calls his kind Forsaken. This one, who appears to be a naga in shape but an elf otherwise, is Asprah. She is of a new kind, called lamia."

Ezra tips his hat politely.

Nerai bows in turn.

Vindicator Aldar bows. "We thank you, strangers," he says, watching them carefully, particularly Ezra. "Now that the siege is broken, we can send runners inland to find if there is anyone who can help us repair the lifepod and recover the rest of our people."

Saeren looks over her prisoners closely, sparing little time for the introduction. For her a nod is a pretty civil, though, and silence likely for the best.

Drusilla speaks up. "The Exodar crashed relatively intact," she says. "We saw it as we came in. There should be little problem finding assistance. But this one," she says, indicating Nerai, "she claims to be proficient in technology. Perhaps she can be of some assistance."

Nerai nods, and looks down at her toolbelt, in way of demonstration, "Any assistance I can be..."

Aldar regards Nerai gravely. "Assistance would be most appreciated. But our lifepod technology is most sophisticated and delicate. Even with great proficiency, I fear she would do more harm than good, if she lacks the schematics. And they are not present here."

Nerai looks up, "If I can be of help, though, I'd like to at least try." She looks at Aldar earnestly.

The vindicator nods. "Come this way, then," he says, guiding Nerai into the interior. "This is the main life support module," he says, opening a panel and indicating a complicated series of colored glass tubes and painted wires, lights flickering deep inside. "Apprentice Vishael here," he says, indicating a draenei woman peering at the works, "tells me that there is damage to the revival mechanism, and the failsafes are refusing to revive our companions until the damage is repaired."

Nerai quickly finds that the device is working on completely unfamiliar principles. She has no idea, for example, what manner of energy is flowing along the colored glass tubes that wind through the system, or even why particular colors matter - Vishael insists that they do, but she has no further knowledge. "If only we could speak to one of our senior engineers! But most of them are still suspended thanks to this problem. And I can't even find out whether any of the other pods survived, because of the communicator malfunction."

Nerai stands up, and dusts her hands off. "Maybe the senior engineers in some of the other pods made out better? Maybe we can find one of them to help." She is standing now. She's slightly embarassed she couldnt' help, after insisting, but, at least she's trying.

"How urgent iss thiss?" Ezra asks carefully.

Vishael peers at the works. "I do not know. The life signs have been faltering for the past several weeks, but I do not know how much worse they will get. We lost about a dozen people last week," she says gravely. "None have died since then, but it could happen at any time."

"And standing here talking will help that?" asks Saeren.

Ezra snaps a semi-rigid piece of paper, covered in runes, out of one of his many pockets and holds it up. "I have magic enough for two tripss," he explains. "One to anywhere on the issland which your mindss can share with me, yes. One back. I am at your dissposal."

Nerai looks up, "Wait.. You said something about a communicator?" She perks up, "Take me to it. I know somethign of the way we run these already, the familiar technology should be easier to figure out." She is bouncing between her feet now, genuinely excited.

The goblin engineer is quickly led to another, smaller device, this one small enough for two people to carry if necessary, looking rather like a round pedestal or dais. "Here it is," she says. "I know the problem lies with the transmitter mechanism, but my education does not yet cover the principles."

Nerai reaches her claws in, spanners in hand. "Oh, this really isn't much different.." She starts, before she sticks her head into the machine. Nerai is still talking, but it is muffled and so comes out some thing like '... transformer .. colors .. crystal ... ' Soon, she is pulling herself back out "... so hard after all." She gestures to the machine, "Give it a try, I think you'll find it much better."

Vishael blinks. "Just like that?" She runs her hands over several colored crystals set into the base, and beams as an emerald begins to glow, and then to pulse. "You did it! It's connecting..." As she speaks, a translucent image begins to form over the pedestal. "Exarch Menelaous to Ammen Vale lifepod. Is that you?"

"Aldar here," says the leader. "It's good to hear from you! Listen, we have urgent need of an experienced lifepod engineer. Have you any such personnel?" "Certainly. Artificer Daelo should serve your purposes." Menealous' image clears, to be replaced by another. "Daelo here. May I speak to whoever repaired your transmitter?"

Nerai looks around, "Nerai here." She says, sliding aroudn in front of the console.

"Excellent," says Daelo, then looks down. "You? You're one of those... goblins! How'd you come to-" Vishael cuts off. "Senior engineer, whatever manner of being she is, she did repair the transmitter where I could not. Please, we may lose more of our people in arguing."

A complicated interlude follows, and at the end of it Daelo looks regretful. "You will need a new control assembly, and based on Vishael's inventory, you do not have the parts to manufacture one quickly. We can send you a replacement by courier tomorrow, provided there are no more naga prowling along the road."

"There will be no more naga prowling," says Saeren.

Aldar steps forward. "The goblin engineer's arcanist companion has offered to use a pair of pre-encoded transportation spells," he says. "How large is this control assembly?" In response, Daelo holds up a heavily inscribed cylinder about three inches wide and a foot long.

"Suk kutat pet," spits Ezra, and vanishes. He's replaced with a hint of Ezra on the communicator's display, having abruptly teleported across the island. "Give it to me," he croaks.

Daelo peers through the communicator at Aldar, who nods. The engineer hands over the cylinder. "Do be careful with it, sir," he says.

The scroll has crumbled to ash in his hands. Ezra replaces it with the cylinder, carefully intoning the same spell. In the blink of an eye he's returned with his burden. "If you require other ssuch transsport, ssee me tomorrow," he suggests.

Nerai takes the cylinder from Ezra. She talks to Daelo on the other end of the communicator. "Okay, so it goes by the purple housing, behind the green bus. Got it." She carefully takes the cylinder over to the life support module, and after a false start, gets teh tube installed. The panel hums back to life, several long overdue alarm indicators go off, but otherwise functional.

Vishael springs to life, manipulating the control panel, half from training and half from the instructions of Daelo's image looking over her shoulder. Soon, her posture relaxes. "All is well. How can we ever repay you?" Aldar interjects: "For a _start_, we can repay Ezra for the expenses he has incurred on our behalf. Will you be passing by Menelaous' encampment? If he survived, surely some of our own arcanists did as well. He will surely be able to provide replacements for those enchanted parchments."

"Life is repayment," explains Ezra quietly, but says no more.

Still left to manage is the matter of the naga who survived the party's wrath. They have been held together, with several armed draenei helping to stand watch over them. Thus far, they have not said anything - the female because she is gagged, and the males for their own reasons - but they have been glaring at their captors. And most particularly at Asprah, who has been making a point of letting them see her.

Saeren points at one of the male naga. "You first." She wastes little time. "If you wish to help, Asprah, you are welcome, but this may not end pretty." If Nerai and Ezra want to see their invitation is essentially assumed. But once you've seen one naga turned inside out, you've seen them all.

"I am not saying anything," says the male slowly, glancing at the others. "You will not get me to reveal your secrets."

"This isn't an interrogation," replies Saeren. "I don't care a whit of your secrets. I'm not after you life. If I wanted your death I would have had it, the way I like it." Which is to say slow and instructive. "I want your very soul back from the filth that has enslaved it. I give you a drink, and the drink gives you a choice. The choice is this: to be free or be a naga slave. One extra warning. I have promised that there will be no living naga in this area. This will not be a lie."

The naga's eyes widen - as do those of the other captives. "You would make me... like her?" he says, glancing at Asprah. There is a hint of curiosity in his eyes, though he tries to cover it. "What you do with us if we drink?"

"I wait and see what choice you make. The drink does not force a choice, it reveals one," says Saeren. "And yes, it is my hope you will be like her. She was the first to break free. You would be the second. Though I may pretend to feel otherwise, I would vastly prefer there not be more blood spilled this day."

"But I will not hesitate to slay my enemies," concludes the night elf.

The male looks again at his companions, particularly at the female, who stares at Asprah penetratingly for several moments... then finally, nods. The male turns back. "I try it."

Saeren offers forth the cup filled with water to the naga's mouth, tipping it so that he might drink. "The choice is your own, now."

Asprah watches the results with fascination. When the newly born lamia raises his head, running a hand through his newly grown hair with puzzlement, she smiles. "Welcome to the new world. What is your name?"

"Lurith," he replies.

"Lurith, which of these is most likely to be your brother?" asks Saeren, looking back to the males. The female will have to wait.

"He will, I think," says Lurith, pointing to one of the male captives. "Not sure about him," he continues, pointing at the next. He turns to the female, hesitates, and shrugs. "Never know what Lady Ssudran is thinking."

Ezra casually approaches Saeren, and leans over to whisper. His fetid breath may offend, but his words are clear: "he sspeaks truth, yes."

Saeren nods to Lurith, "Then we will start with the likely." She nods to Ezra, "As odd as it might seem, I do not doubt the words of the Lamia. They are my brothers and sisters, to replace what was lost and can never be fully replaced." The cup is offered to the more likely of the males first, "For the first time in ages you now may decide, freely."

Once more, the naga drinks from the chalice; once more, a lamia rises. "What will become of us, Asprah?" he asks. "There's only us three, right?" He glances at the remaining naga. "Maybe a few more, I dunno."

"You will be free," says Saeren. "You are three now, but many more shall join you before my end comes." The night elf turns to the last two. "You will decide now. You have seen these kindred of yours move away from the darkness of the deep. There is a light that will always welcome you home. There is a light that is not above warming even a heart so dark as mine." She offers the drink to the last male, "If you will it, it shall welcome you home as well."

The male leans away from the chalice, but looks at his mistress, who nods emphatically. He takes a drink, and screams, as did the others... but when he rises, the scales remain. "No," says the naga in a gravelly voice. "Tempting, but... no. You may slay me, but Dagun will have you in the end."

"I will slay you," says Saeren. She turns to the mistress then, "But first I want to see what kind of a leader you are. He is tempted, he does not wish to cling to this, I think. Will you condemn him, or will you save him by embracing this new hope? I wonder.." She offers up the chalice with one hand, and with the other she holds an arrow, "Should you refuse, I'm afraid you will have no time to whisper a word of magic."

Ezra has stayed mostly silent, but now he doffs his hat and approaches the naga witch. "Are you aware of the War of the Shifting Ssands, my lady?" he asks, pausing for a moment to allow recollection to work before speaking. "The Old God called C'thun had crafted an entire civilization in its image, yes. The ssilithid. Thiss much is known to the wise. These unsstoppable creaturess went to war against Kalimdor once. Do you know who opposed them?"

"The elvess." The Forsaken clasps his hands behind his back. "They had _nothing_, my lady. The elvess shun the power of the arcane - that very power which has brought you periloussly close to death once today. But they had sspirit. And in the end, they were victorouss. And now they rouse themsselves from their long ssleep to fight another war. And this time - _this_ time - they have the aid of otherss who will let _nothing_ sstop them from ssecuring victory." Carefully he unwraps his bandages, revealing his hideously burned face for the naga caster to inspect.

"You musst be wise, to wield the powerss you do. Therefore I am ssurprised that you might sspurn this offer. Not simply because you may die, but because thiss battle has been fought before. The outcome is known. Lady, I feel that you don't realize just who you have offended. I urge you to consider this matter gravely." And so saying, the sorcerer turns away.

"Mmm?" says the naga questioningly, nodding toward the lamia. Asprah glances at Saeren, and slithers forward to remove her gag. "Is that the only one you have?" she says slowly and carefully, looking at the converted chalice.

Saeren arches an eyebrow, "This isn't an interrogation." The cup is forced to the naga's lips and spilled so she might drink. Or die.

With the cup held to her lips, the naga looks Saeren in the eye. "It is, isn't it. You will need help making more. How fortunate you were to capture me." She tilts her head back and drinks...

And a lamia named Ssudran arises from the floor, breathing heavily but smiling. "That was... not as bad as I feared it would be," she says.

Saeren helps up the Lamia with a laugh, "You had me very worried." She lets out a deep sigh and turns to the remaining male. "You are the first ever to receive a second chance. Seeing your mistress change her mind, I want you to think it through carefully once more." The elf again offers him a drink and steps back, "Will you be our brother, or must we forget your name?"

The lone remaining naga looks at the chalice... looks at Ssudran... and then looks at Saeren. "She is not my mistress now."

"No," says Saeren quietly. "Sadly for you, she is not." The night elf looks to the others and then turns back. The death blow is quick and clean when it comes, and there is no joy for the night elf at the loss of this enemy. She turns away, looking over the Lamia, her eyes glittering for a moment before she turns away, "I am grateful for all of you." She looks to the body of the lost for only a moment. "Let's leave this place."

Ssudran shakes her head. "Such foolish commitment to the past," she says, looking at her hands. "Let us go forth and make the future."
