# Turning Tides 2009-08-30a

Nearly a thousand years before the Dark Portal first opened, there was war in Kalimdor. The Old God of the desert, C'thun, had arisen from his slumber and sent his minions, the qiraji and the silithid, to conquer Azeroth which had been taken from him by the Titans countless millenia ago.

Only one race had the might to stand in their way: the kaldorei - night elves - led by the mighty Arch-Druid Fandral Staghelm. And even they were steadily being driven back before the relentless onslaught of the qiraji...

---

General Rajaxx, the mighty qiraji commander, had been driven off, but throughout the night, his forces had harassed the Staghelm encampment. Morning came, and with it, an eerie quiet. And then, a band of sentinels and druids from the south, bearing dire news: the night elf village of Southwind was under attack.

Fandral Staghelm wasted no time; the messengers were escorted to the command tent. "You say you were beset on all sides," he said. "How is it that you escaped?"

The young Priestess of Elune, Belana Moonshadow, spoke. "We owe our survival to Saeren, my lord," she said. "Her arrows cut a great swathe through the foe, and fended them off as we made our escape." She nods to her companion.

This is Saeren as she was before, a young, focused woman who was dedicated to her people. Already her skills with the bow were great and her heart courageous and bold. "It was what had to be done," says Saeren simply. She looks to Fandral seriously, "I was able to gain a measure of the enemy and I believe I see a way to relieve the city before it is too late."

The arch-druid nods. "What do you suggest?" he says, raising a bushy eyebrow. Though Staghelm is renowned for his wisdom, he is reputed to only take the advice of those he trusts and respects. Just this once, though, his bearing is less reserved than normal; he seems to show genuine interest in the young sentinel's ideas.

"To surround the city, they've had to thin some of their lines," says Saeren. "They seem to think it unlikely that we'll break through to the south, and so they've reinforced every other direction. It's a longer march for us, but I know we can break them there. With the right force we can manage it without even being detected and outflank them."

Fandral stroked his chin. "An intriguing suggestion," he says, nodding. "It would have to be a small force, though, if it is to avoid the prying eyes of the qiraji. And there is a danger, too. Have you considered the possibility that they have set a trap? Their general, for all his cruelty, is extremely cunning."

"Father, you know we can't send our entire force to free Southwind," says Valstann Staghelm. "If we do, we run the risk of opening our lines and allowing them to press on past Silithus and into the forests to the north. A small force is our best chance for defending the city."

The elder Staghelm seems troubled. "I know. And we cannot simply leave Southwind to their fate." He turns to Saeren. "Have you commanded elves in battle before today?"

"I've commanded scouting parties," says Saeren. "That will be enough to turn the tide, so long as they are steady and don't panic."

Valstann shakes his head. "Saeren, brave as you are, I think you're going to need more support. The scouting parties might be able to break their lines, but you'll need more forces to press your advantage." He turns to Fandral. "Father, let me lead a detachment. I will defend the city and I will return victorious."

Saeren accepts the correction, inwardly hopeful at the prospect of more help, but planning in her mind how to get by without it, if it comes to it.

Fandral Staghelm looks amongst his advisors, and then closes his eyes in concentration. This war has already forced many hard choices upon him, but this is the hardest yet. Finally, he looks his son in the eye. "Go, then. But do not worry about the honor of the name of Staghelm. Return alive and I will be more than satisfied."

---

The gates of Southwind draw near. No qiraji have been seen as the detachment crept around the city, and precious few silithid; the handful of wasps that overflew were quickly felled by Saeren or her fellow sentinels, and they moved faster, knowing that the silithid scouts would soon be missed.

Valstann eyes the city in the distance. "It is as you said, Saeren. The crawlers are massed around the eastern western flanks. If we can break through here, we can flank the attackers on both sides, and roll them up like a scroll."

Something is bothering Saeren, but it's not anything she can explain. "All the same, Captain, I feel we need to make haste," she says quietly. "I feel ill at ease. I had hoped to avoid detection a little longer."

Valstann nods. "All is in readiness." He turns to the massed night elves behind him, and raises the battle standard high. "For Fandral Staghelm! For Cenarius and Elune!"

But as the charge rushes toward the walls of Southwind, Saeren's heart sinks, and she realizes too late what had bothered her so. The sands of the desert to either side had been moving with the wind, but there had been something amiss with the spill of the grains over the dunes. And now it is too late, as the desert is suddenly boiling, not only with silithid, but with their masters, the Qiraji. As she turns, she sees them closing the gap behind the night elf detachment. And she hears the qiraji begin to chant, "Rajaxx! Rajaxx! Rajaxx!"

Sure enough, the great qiraji general rises up, golden sand cascading from his shoulders as he towers over the night elves. "Ah, Valstann Staghelm," he rasps, his voice thundering over the battlefield. "I have you now."

"Captain, get out of here!" Saeren fires immediately, desperate to draw attention away from the target of this ruse to herself.

"Never!" cries Valstann in rage. "Rajaxx! I will destroy you myself!" He runs forward, twin moonglaives raised and scything through the qiraji ranks. Saeren's arrow skitters off Rajaxx's hide and is ignored; the rest of the minions of C'thun close in around the night elves, and the tides of battle sweep Saeren away from Valstann's side.

Saeren sees the younger Staghelm alive only once more. Only a tiny fraction of the detachment has managed to escape the ambush, and it is three long days, lurking in the shadows during the day and traveling only by night, before they draw near to Fandral Staghelm's camp... only to find that Rajaxx has arrived ahead of them.

As with the main night elf force, Saeren's surviving allies - little more than a squadron now - are helpless to watch as General Rajaxx emerges from the ranks of his army, holding the wounded Valstann in one arm. And even as Fandral arouses from his shock and dismay and begins to charge, the general grasp the young night elf and tears him in two.

The night elves, their morale broken by the despair of their leader, fall back into Un'goro, Saeren's squadron managing to win through to join them. Only when they enter the basin do they find respite, as the qiraji and silithid halt at the crater's edge and do not follow.

Fandral himself has fallen into a deep brooding; he lurks at the volcanic vents of Fire Plume Ridge, looking out to the west and paying little attention to those who draw near.

Saeren sees the look on Fandral's face and makes no attempt to bring peace to him with words. That must come later, if any of them are still alive. The last handfull of warriors from the relief group settle around her, easing their wounds. Saeren herself is only standing by sheer willpower. In her mind the death of Valstann is played again and again. "We will have our vengeance," she growls softly to herself.

And she is near enough to Fandral Staghelm to hear his own muttered words. Gone is the proud and confident general of the night elves that she had met less than a week before. He looks to the west with hollow eyes, and murmurs, "It is my fault. I was a fool. I should never have let him go." His fist tightens, and his eyes narrow. "I will have him back. Though it takes millennia, I will have my son back."
