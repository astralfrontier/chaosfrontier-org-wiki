# Turning Tides 2009-09-06

The Battle for Tides' Hollow was two days ago, and yet the words of the Forsaken agent, who had stood by the naga warlord's side, still echo in Ezra's head: "You who call yourself Ezra Pyreborn: Your wife and child hate you now. If you wish to be reconciled with them, you must join with us. Go to the Sepulcher in Silverpine, and speak the name of Timothy Lammas. You will be recognized."

Now, as the adventurers recuperate at Azure Watch, the shaman Farseer Sobcha returns bearing a message for Ezra. "There is a being who wishes to speak with you," he says. "He is one of the beings who delivered us from the Burning Legion thousands of years ago, when our people first fled the man'ari. He wishes to speak with you." _Man'ari_, as the adventurers have learned, is the word the draenei use for the demonic eredar that are more familiar to the people of Azeroth, the ones who sold their souls to the Dark Titan.

The wizard cogitates on this. He has planned and connived and plotted, attempting to spearhead a small but effective strike against the naga invasion. Now he sees that the board is changed, and hands reach for him as a pawn. "Your servant, sir," he replies, tipping his hat. "I will go immediately."

As Ezra enters the Exodar, two draenei warriors accompany him and the Farseer, each bearing the tabard of the Hand of Argus. They lead him deep into the Exodar, and down a broad and shallow spiral staircase, illuminated from below by a brilliant light. To his eyes, it is no brighter than sunlight, but unlike sunlight which can be felt merely as heat on his skin which penetrates no deeper, this seems to warm him to the bones. And yet, unlike the tales he has heard from his kin who have faced the paladins of the Scarlet Crusade, this light does not burn.

Finally, as the final turn of the staircase passes, he sees... well, it seems at first like a great floating statue, illuminated from behind by this warming light, a forty-foot-tall statue of a stylized humanoid figure made of geometric shapes that seem to be made of ceramic. And then the shapes slowly orbit one another, and he realizes that this is the naaru he has been sent to meet: O'ros.

The escorting draenei kneel before the figure and bow their heads, as does the Broken shaman. And the light from the figure shimmers, and the naaru's body chimes softly. No words are spoken, and yet there is a voice: **Greetings, Ezra Pyreborn. I am grateful that you agreed to speak with me.**

Ezra doffs his hat and inclines his head. He does not bow, but he hunches perhaps a bit more than is usual for him. "You called. I have come. Thank you for your time, yes."

**I requested your presence because you are strange to me, Ezra Pyreborn,** says the voice of O'ros. **In the countless millennia that we have roamed the universe with the draenei, we have often encountered the unquiet dead who rise of their own accord, and we have just as often seen the Burning Legion use the power of necromancy as a weapon of war. Yet hitherto we have seen only three results of this: the bodies of the dead turned into mindless creatures; shades who wander the earth bereft of all purpose save one; or cruel abominations who partake of the half-death to better serve the Legion. You are none of these. Will you tell me how this came to be?**

"Through the redemption of the Dark Lady, Ssylvanas Windrunner," Ezra explains. "The plague of undeath leavess those infected with partss of their mind and ssoul intact insside the corpse, yess. She.. regained her self-control. She brought otherss back from that abyss. All of uss.. the Forssaken.. were once ssuch mindless creaturess as you describe. Now we fight on two frontierss of a war. In the lands of Lordaeron. And.. in our own mindss."

The naaru's body chimes. **We had not thought this was possible. Until now, any unfortunate soul whose body had been tainted by undeath had been trapped, locked away, until freed by their body's destruction.** The glow brightens slightly, and several beams of light pass briefly over Ezra's form. **The taint is stronger in you than in any we have previously encountered, and yet you tell us that the Light shines through. This is marvelous. And there are more of you... Forsaken? Why do you take such a name for yourself?**

"Look at the facess of your guards and champions for the answer," the wizard suggests slyly. "Look at how they long to sstep away as I pass. Their muscles tightened. Their eyes averted. Honor and dignity holds them from recoiling entirely. Do you think that any other living ssouls of this world have welcomed uss any more openly?"

**I cannot deny your words,** agrees O'ros. **No matter how strong they are in the Light, the living cannot help but fear death and the reminders thereof. Even now that you have proven yourself many times over to Velen's people, there is the fear.** There is a pause. **Are there those on this world, this Azeroth, who teach the three virtues of the Light: tenacity, respect, and compassion?**

"The paladinss of the Order of the Ssilver Hand. Some of their old bookss.. still exist in the ruins of Lordaeron's chapelss, yess." Ezra looks away. "Adherentss of the Holy Light are found more among the Alliance than the Horde, but they sspeak of such things. And the Argent Dawn acceptss all those who fight under ssuch virtues against the Scourge."

The draenei guards raise their heads and gaze wonderingly at Ezra. "Is this true? Have we finally reached the end of our journey?" says one. O'ros shimmers in response. **It is a hopeful sign,** says the naaru. **What of your people, Ezra Pyreborn? From the tales that are told of you, you have exhibited all three virtues: tenacity in the face of your own condition, respect for ally and enemy alike, and compassion even for the naga. Do your people still teach the Three Virtues?**

"The Light..." The wizard returns his hat to his head, pulling it down over his luminescent eyes. "The Light iss only used by those who hunt uss to extinction," he answers at last. "The Sscarlet Crusade, yes. Those of uss who were once priestss of the Light losst it.. There iss now a faith called the Forgotten Shadow which is preached within the Undercity. Its virtuess are... not quite the ssame, no."

**And what virtues are these?**

The wizard paces. "Respect - to know your place is to survive there. Tenacity - to challenge the world for a place. And Power - to become something, to remain something, to exert your will upon the world, to not ssimply fade into the abyss once more."

**Strangely altered,** observes O'ros. **Yet not entirely unlike. This faith is well named. Shadow - the border between Light and Dark. Your people still understand the Light, even if the curse you bear prevents it from shining forth. You have done better than my own kind would, in such a pass. Or at least, some of you have. That being who served the naga at Tides' Hollow - he was also of the kind known as Forsaken?**

"Yess. Ssome of the Forssaken have .. been misled from the true path," Ezra explains delicately. "They have believed the liess of the naga, believed that there wass a place in the new world order the minions of Dagun proposse to bring about. One of my taskss has been to.. rectify their missunderstanding, yes."

**Are you certain that they are lies?** asks O'ros. **Though those of Darkness are often rent by internal strife, they may just as often work together. The Burning Legion are of many species from many worlds, and yet they share a common vision of destruction and chaos, and they cooperate to those ends. Perhaps this Old God Dagun would truly accept the Forsaken as its servants, just as it has with the naga. Would it change your viewpoint, if you believed this to be true?**

"Then.. I would be forced to see them as traitors, and not comradess," answers Ezra carefully. "And I would be forced to destroy them."

**What is it that the Forsaken would betray, if they served the naga?**

"They would have betrayed the gift of the Dark Lady. The gift of the sself returned, the gift of exisstence.. yes." Ezra looks up now at O'ros. "They would betray the kinship we cling sso desperately to, blinded and lost in their hatred of the living. Doess it ssurprise you to know that ssome of us see the living as the enemy?"

**It does not,** acknowledges O'ros. **I spoke of the fear that the living have for the dead. What you speak of now is the mirror image of that fear - either a reciprocation of the hostility you face, or merely a fear of that which is not like the self.** The naaru is silent for a moment. **I have asked you many questions. Is there anything you would ask of me in return?**

Ezra considers for a moment. "Ssend away your guardss," he asks. "I am no threat to you, and they will not find what I ssay to their liking, yess."

The draenei narrow their eyes, but the naaru broadcasts a feeling of reassurance. **I will send for you if there is need.** The draenei depart reluctantly, and Ezra is alone with the being of Light, which twinkles with amused curiosity. **What do you have to say that would trouble the draenei so?** he asks.

"I have perceived the truth at last," Ezra says, staring up at the creature. "It is this - the Light is nothing. The Light is powerless. And having ssaid this, I wish to explain mysself."

**You were correct,** observes O'ros, now truly intrigued. **Few draenei indeed would fail to be outraged by such apparent heresy. Go on.**

"It iss just thiss. The power of the Light comess to the priestss of Stormwind, and to the noble paladinss of the Ssilver Hand. But it alsso comes to the call of the Sscarlet Crussade - who commit what to my people is needless and zealous genocide, yess. The cursse I labor under is the curse of undeath, a power that not even a Titan - the shaperss of this world - wass able to readily undo, yess. So then.. the Light.. it is nothing more than the dedication of oneself to a cause. It iss the manifestation of one's power in the sservice of that cause. And you.. your cause... is the extinction of the Burning Legion from this universse, as I have been told. Noble indeed, but... the powerss you wield in the service of that crusade come from you. Not a far-off untapped power hidden in the cosmos. But from you. And from them," he adds, gesturing in the direction of the departed draenei.

"These virtuess you speak of... they are nothing more than disciplines intended to focus one's mind on his cause, yes. It is not the Holy Light which has taken the livess of my Forsaken comradess, it is the Scarlet Crusade's dedication. The Light is.. just a name for it. Just a banner under which you rally." And so saying, Ezra falls silent.

**In only one way do you err,** replies O'ros. **Our crusade is not to destroy the Burning Legion, but to bring all living beings together in harmony, strengthening the ties that bind all things to all other things; the Burning Legion are but the most powerful forces of dissolution that hinder us in this. In all other respects, you are correct.** The naaru seems both pleased and amused. **If you were to ask the draenei why they fight in behalf of the Light, there are many who would not understand what you meant.**

"Very well. This bringss us to the other matter which would offend your draenei soldierss." Ezra manages a smile behind his bandages. "I am not a living thing. Perhapss I have a place in your grand sscheme, perhapss not. There are those among the Forssaken who wish to return themselves to true life. They...are most often those who still possess some remnant of life to return to. I do not wissh to be your enemy. But ... my people will not entirely undersstand or welcome allies of the Light, for reasonss which we have sspoken of."

**We have never known any way to cleanse a soul tainted by undeath, except to return that soul to the natural cycle of death and rebirth,** O'ros observes. **To 'kill' it, you might say. But... we have also not known your kind before, whose light burns strongly enough to resume control of the body even in death. I cannot foresee for certain whether this difference is enough to allow true life to be restored to your kind, but I do foresee that the effort to do so will be worthwhile. I will speak with Velen, and urge his people to provide what aid they can.**

"Thiss is not your cause." Ezra holds up a hand. "I don't believe that your power can aid uss, if it is not in the hearts of the draenei to do so. And as we have sspoken, we are not called Forssaken for nothing. But.. you may answer my one and real question. Can the Forssaken wield the Light in their current state, themselves? Can they find the power to become part of this benevolent union you propose?"

**I... do not know,** says O'ros. **Your curse does stifle the expression of the Light, being shaped from the true darkness of necromancy. The Forgotten Shadow undoubtedly arose to allow your people to focus their will in the face of this handicap. But... I will not say it is impossible.**

"Then.. for those who wissh to entertain this hope... there iss another potential form of instruction in the world," cogitates Ezra. He pauses. "I remain at your dissposal for as long as we remain on thiss island, but.. circumstances compel me to .. hurry."

**Of course,** says O'ros. **The Old God awakens. Our people still struggle with the Burning Legion, but we must also struggle to preserve our newest home. I will not impair you in your crusade. Instead, I will speak to you a foretelling of your personal future, if you wish it. Of the family you left behind when you first perished.**

"I.... " Ezra hesitates. "Very well."

**It is not much,** O'ros admits. **But there is this: The Forsaken at Tides' Hollow said that your family hates you now. This is the truth, but it is also a lie. They are beset by darkness which threatens to consume them, but you will have the chance to guide them back into the light.**

"Interesting," whispers the wizard to himself. He does not even say goodbye, but simply strides out of the chamber, moving as fast as he can muster without actually breaking into a run. Something checks him - a final thought, or politeness, or something else - and he halts and turns at the exit. "Good-bye, O'ros. You are wrong in this. It is not Light which manifests itself through me. It is l.." His final word cuts itself off as he departs.
