# Turning Tides 2009-12-06

The Defiant, under Tyrande's direction, crosses the mountains northeast of Auberdine and into a sylvan paradise. Vast oaks fill the valley from one end to the other, with Lake Elune'ara gleaming like a jewel in the center.

"Moonglade," Tyrande says, smiling for the first time since their departure from Azuremyst. "Please fly slowly, Captain Nerai. We have been seen." Sure enough, a flock of birds emerges from the forest below and begins to keep pace with the airship. Their leader detaches from the flock and alights on the prow of the Defiant, shapeshifting into its night elven form. "Who goes there?" he demands, before catching himself. "Lady Whisperwind," he adds, bowing. "You come to us in strange guise."

Nerai adjusts the various control surfaces to bring the ship to more of a steady pace.

The druid's demeanor changes as he takes in the rest of the crew of the Defiant, his gaze registering distinct disapproval as it passes over the goblin and especially the Forsaken. "And in strange company," he adds, in a rather cooler tone.

Tyrande shakes her head. "You will consider them my guests, sir. Please escort us to Remulos' glade." The druid looks apprehensive. "As you wish, milady," he says doubtfully and launches himself again.

Saeren looks a little uneasy at the sudden appearance of the druids, taking a protective step closer to Nerai (even if there is no danger.) "This has to be about as far from home as you can imagine," she asides.

The Defiant is guided to a landing amidst the trees into a small clearing. As the airship's engines wind down, an imposing figure emerges, with the torso of a night elf and the body of a great stag. "Remulos," Tyrande greets him, as she disembarks. "May I introduce to you the saviors of Silverwind Refuge and Maestra's Post."

Ezra tips his hat politely.

The Keeper of the Grove bows, regarding the motley crew of the Defiant with rather greater politeness than his subordinates had. "And what do we owe the honor of your visit, Tyrande?" he rumbles.

Tyrande quickly describes her conversation with Fandral Staghelm, and her concerns for Teldrassil. Remulos listens, and finally shakes his head. "The corruption of Teldrassil is concerning, to be sure. Yet I think you underestimate just how robust a World Tree is. They partake of the purity of the Emerald Dream itself, in its creation. No mere mortal poisons could taint Teldrassil in the way you describe."

"The cursse of an Old God is upon the naga, sir," ventures Ezra, hobbling forward on his cane and staring up. "The poison of the ssoul of one of its sservants, transsmuted by the power of a Titan into a curative, has been their ... ssalvation. We do not sspeak of merely mortal taintss, no, but mortal effort may sseemingly improve the efficacy of Dagun'ss cursse."

Remulos rubs his bearded chin. "An Old God's power... yes, that _could_ taint a World Tree. But we have studied the chalices you recovered from the naga. Their curse could not have been potent enough to affect a World Tree. They would somehow have to expose Teldrassil to the Old God's power directly."

"Do you deny them the capability to do sso?" asks the wizard, cocking his head curiously, staring at the Keeper.

Nerai looks about, "Just because the engine stops knocking, doesn't mean you fixed it...."

"And with something of this much import, excessive caution would not be amiss," adds Saeren.

The Keeper frowns at the assembled company. "There is a more dire possibility than simply the naga's interference. Teldrassil's roots may have grown into the lair of the Old God itself." He nods grimly to Tyrande. "No wonder Fandral Staghelm took your suggestion poorly. Teldrassil is his brainchild, and he would take ill the suggestion that it suffers Vordrassil's fate."

The night elf leaders explain briefly. Vordrassil, in ages past, was a World Tree grown in the distant land of Northrend. The night elves' history tells that its roots had grown entangled with the lair of the Old God Yogg-Saron. The resulting corruption proved impossible to purge, and Vordrassil was destroyed.

"So what do we do to prevent this? And if it is corrupted, what happens?" asks Saeren.

Ezra composes himself after a few moments. "Very well," he says, and sweeps an arm to indicate Saeren and Nerai. "Our purposse here is to fully impress upon you the urgency of Dagun's menace. Thiss we seem to have done. If we can assist you further, you will find uss willing, yes. But there are otherss to be warned. How do you wish to proceed?"

Remulos scratches his horned head. "Short of felling Teldrassil entirely, we can attempt to find the offending roots and cut them off at the source. But Lord Staghelm must be persuaded to allow such a thing. Tyrande may be the leader of the night elves, but Staghelm is the master of Teldrassil."

"And what harm to Teldrassil if we cut off one of the roots?" asks Saeren calmly.

"It will weaken the World-Tree, much as if you had cut the roots of a mortal tree," Remulos replies. "Staghelm will never agree to such a risky course of action until he is convinced there is no other alternative. And he has already refused Lady Whisperwind's counsel on the matter; nor is he likely to heed my advice on the matter of Teldrassil, else it would never have been planted in the first place."

Ezra rubs his forehead with a bandaged hand. "Very well. Musst we expose the rootss ourselvess for him to believe?" he asks.

"You had best leave that to Tyrande and myself... Forsaken," Remulos says, nodding pointedly to Ezra. "This must be handled amongst the kaldorei. You have helped all you can, I fear." A ghost of a smile flickers on the Keeper's face. "Unless you can imagine someone Staghelm _will_ listen to."

"He listened to his son, once," says Saeren softly. "And it cost him dearly. I think after that, it will be very hard to persuade him to do something he does not believe in."

Ezra stands silently, head down, eyes hidden behind the brim of his hat. Only Nerai, short enough to see the hints behind the bandages, can see the contortions of the burnt facial muscles. He is thinking to himself, subvocalizing, considering. His hands abruptly dig into his pockets. One comes up after a moment, bearing the crushed and carefully flattened remnants of a purple flower. He stares at it. And then he looks up, straight at Remulos.

"Yess. I have such a person."

Remulos looks startled. "Who do you propose, Ezra Pyreborn?"

The wizard leers from behind his bandages. "Hohoho. Hahahhaa. Yess. And why not? To ssave a race from extinction, they would... yess, they musst... and perhapss we will meet that confusing creature again, yess." He shakes his head a moment. "Ahh, I propose to call the Bronze Dragonflight's representative to Moonglade. I beg your permission, ssir. We will call upon the services of Valstann Staghelm in thiss matter."

"His son?" Remulos cries out. "Are you mad, Forsaken? He has been dead for-" He breaks off. "Ah, of course. This is a great favor you would ask of the Lords of Time, Ezra Pyreborn, to reach back across the millenium. But... if you can get _their_ cooperation, I will hardly be the one to stand in their way."

"Very well. I know of a druid who sspeaks to the Blue Dragonflight. I will assk that they in turn assk this of the Bronze," explains Ezra. "She was in Wintersspring when lasst we sspoke. If you will assist me in this magic, I ssee no reason not to contact her now."

"You are familiar with Alea'sha?" Remulos says. "Very well. But we do not need to travel as far as Winterspring, either in the flesh or by way of the Dream. She is present in Moonglade now. I will lead the way." He smiles. "Perhaps your tales are yet intertwined, Ezra Pyreborn. For she is here to look after her mentor, whom she and her new patrons have rescued from the Wailing Caverns. It seems that Dagun's reach extended there as well."

---

Alea'sha is astonished to see Ezra Pyreborn in Moonglade, but when she hears his tale, she is more than happy to contact the blue dragonflight on his behalf.

A few days pass, during which the various travelers compare notes about the rising threat of the naga. Alea'sha reports that the fragile peace between the orcs and night elves at Warsong still holds, and that the naga have been steadily pushed back in Azshara; and Ezra in turn tells of the new allies from Outland.

Finally on the third day, a female gnome slips into Jeddek Ironhorn's sickroom. "Hah! I was right," she says. "A night elf, a tauren, a goblin, and a Forsaken, they said. So of course I had to see if it was you guys. I believe I said last time that I'd ask your names next time we met. Well, now's the time." Kaladormi grins. "I think."

Nerai starts and stands. She turns to the gnome, and smiles, "I am Nerai Escapement." She bows, then sits back down.

The Forsaken wizard tips his hat. "Ezra L. Pyreborn," he says casually. "We propose to resurrect Valstann Staghelm."

Saeren starts at the appearance of the gnome. She rises quickly and nods. "Saeren.." She falls silent for a moment of thought and decides, "Just Saeren is fine."

"Kagarn Stormhoof, at your service," replies the taciturn shaman.

The gnome nods. "Well, Ezra... that's a pretty big favor to ask. Of course, you did _me_ a pretty big favor. Still..." Kaladormi's sunny expression dims. "it's not easy for my people to think about the War of the Shifting Sands, either. We often fret that there might have been something more we could do." She looks carefully at Ezra. "I assume you intend to bring the younger Staghelm back to this era, right?"

"Hiss body was broken. All ssaw that," says Ezra carefully. He has heard this tale in preparation for the audacious stroke he proposes. "Hiss soul... well, that iss another matter. We will give him life in thiss time."

Saeren's jaw drops at the suggestion, and she sits down rather suddenly before her gasp escapes in a murmur, "Is it possible?"

"It's been a thousand years," says Kaladormi. "His spirit would have long since returned to the cycle by now. That's where I would come in. We send you four back to the War of the Shifting Sands, as soon after his death as we can reach. You fetch his body and get it somewhere safe - being careful not to let your past selves see you," she says, nodding significantly to Saeren. "You bring him back to life. And then I bring you all back to the present."

Ezra nods. "Jusst so," he says firmly.

The gnome hops up onto a nearby bench. "Tricky," she says. "Do you know where and when he was killed?"

"This will be very dangerous," says Saeren. She looks to her companions, "I need to do this, if it is possible. By all rights it should have been my task." She looks back to the gnome, "I know it. It has been burnt into my mind and nightmares for a thousand years. Perhaps at last I can exorcise that haunt."

"Oh, you were there when it happened?" Kaladormi says. "Splendid! That'll make it tons easier." She pauses, then bows her head to the night elf. "Sorry about that. I get a little carried away, sometimes."

Saeren shakes her head at the dragon, "There is nothing to apologize for. If you can help us right this wrong I will be in the debt of your flight forever."

Kaladormi hops down to the ground again. "All right. It's going to take way too long for that nifty airship of yours to get down to Silithus. How much do you need to bring with you? You're gonna need to be pretty heavily armed to deal with the qiraji, as Saeren can tell you. And I can't go with you, just like I won't be able to go with you when I send you back to the Ordering." She chuckles softly. "You mortal races don't have nearly enough verb tenses."

"We will ssee if Remulos or Tyrande may sspare uss some assistance, yess," Ezra answers, cogitating. "But, we have the advantage of hindssight in thiss matter, yess."

Nerai ponders, "Or Foresight, depending on how you look at it..."

"Our best bet is to avoid the notice of everyone and steal the body as quietly and quickly as possible," says Saeren. "Any fighting we do must be small scale. The Qiraji are very formidible and there is no end of them."

"In any case, we musst have ssomeone capable of enacting the resurrection." The wizard paces. "If Kagarn is capable, all well and good. If not, either the Earthen Ring or the Cenarion Circle musst be assked to do this."

Kagarn muses. "I have grown in my skills," he says. "But I would need some great source of life energy, if I am to do it on my own."

"What kind of source?" asks Saeren.

Jeddek speaks from his sickbed. "If you will be in Silithus, it will not be far to Un'goro Crater. We of the Cenarion Circle do not know much of the place, but it is a wellspring of life. If you will find any place that will assist in the resurrection, you will find it there."

"I can find the way there easily enough," says Saeren. "Is there anything else we need to know?"

Ezra shakes his head. "A ssmall force musst suffice. We musst succeed."

"Jeddek, do you Cenarion guys still have that outpost in Silithus?" The tauren druid nods his assent. "Good. I think we want to get there as soon as possible. Let me go talk to Remulos about him letting me open a portal." She nods to the assembled party. "Prepare what you need. We leave tomorrow morning."

---

After the verdant, living forest of Moonglade, the harsh, wind-swept deserts of Silithus come as a shock. Cenarion Hold is a precarious foothold deep in silithid territory; the Swarming Pillar, a towering peak surrounded by vast hordes of flying silithid, lurks just to the southern border.

The druids of Cenarion Hold are rather more sanguine about unusual visitors than their brethren in Moonglade. Here, on the front lines, anyone who is an enemy of the silithid gains at least a cautious welcome.

The party does not stay long at the Hold, in any case. Saeren knows the way to the site: a windswept plain of sand dunes at the base of a cliff, overlooked by a night elf tower known as Staghelm Point.

"I keep thinking about this," murmurs Saeren. "The biggest challenge is getting his body." She frowns at the shifting sands, "And the bugs are as comfortable below the ground as above."

"Right," says Kaladormi. "We need to send you back to a time and place close enough to get to the body, but not somewhere you'll get jumped right away. That's our advantage. If we're clever, I can send you back somewhere they won't be expecting."

A site is finally chosen. "Right on the day is no good," Kaladormi says. "The bugs will be all over the place. A few days after... right here." She indicates a secluded niche at the base of the cliff. "They'll be guarding the body of course, to prevent exactly the thing you guys are trying to do. But they figure they've got the night elves bottled up in Un'goro, so they won't be expecting you to be able to get here without them catching you."

Kaladormi hands Ezra her token. "It's a lot closer in history than the Ordering, so I don't need you to bring him all the way back here, thank goodness. Soon as you have the lad up and around, just set this off wherever you are, and I'll catch up with you." She takes a few steps back. "All right, this is it. Here we go..."

Once again, the adventurers watch as Kaladormi shapes a gateway in time. "Good luck!" she calls. "And Saeren, remember to not go talking to any night elves!"

The adventurers square up - Nerai starts her engines - and they pass through the portal into history.
