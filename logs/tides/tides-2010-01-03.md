A shimmering portal appears on the sands of Silithus, and four adventurers step through. Outwardly, the terrain seems little different from what the left, a thousand years in the future - an arid, desolate waste with little but desert scrub.

There is one important difference: a great beaten path across the dunes, not thirty yards away. A great qiraji army passed by recently - given the size and direction, it was undoubtedly Rajaxx's main force on its way to challenge Staghelm.

Saeren looks down the track and narrows her eyes. Instincts centuries old come back in a moment. "Qiraji, the main filthy lot of them, too. They will be on their way.." To kill Staghelm's son in front of the night elf's army. "Though it might appear safe, they may have left a few surprises in their wake. We must be cautious."

The site of the battle is no more than a few miles away. Saeren carefully watches the tracks as she proceeds. At semi-regular intervals, trails leave or re-enter the path - only a few individuals leave on each incursion, consistent with scouting parties. All of the traces are at least a day old.

"Find me ssomething perssonal of his," Ezra says after consultation. "We can attempt to track him magically, yess."

Nerai blinks, "We might have more lick at the site..."

Nerai blinks, "We might have more luck at the site..."

As the party approaches the sight of the battle, they can see a few hundred qiraji and silithid, in the process of taking down tents. Several qiraji are on guard, but they are clearly not expecting anyone to be following them - the adventurers pass unnoticed. General Rajaxx is nowhere to be seen, nor is Valstann's corpse - but the rock outcropping upon which Rajaxx stood when he executed Valstann Staghelm is clearly visible. And as they observe the site, Nerai notices, even at this great distance, that the rock is discolored, with a distinct reddish-brown stain.

Nerai points ahead at the rock, turning to Ezra, "Is that going to work for you, Ezra?"

The mage rubs his bandaged hands together. "Yess, that will do quite well. Blood iss .. a powerful tie, yes."

After less than an hour, the qiraji complete the process of breaking camp. A somewhat larger warrior addresses the rest - the voice carries over the dunes, and even if the buzzing and clicking is incomprehensible, there's something about 'drill sergeant' that gets through any language barrier. The silithid beasts of burdens are mounted, and the train proceeds off to the east. Soon there is no sound but the desert wind.

Nerai wheels Eecee into place, moving to stand near the rock, looking out for anyone who may interrupt Ezra's work.

Ezra scuttles across the sand and rock to approach the bloodstain, looking about warily for signs of stragglers or observation.

The flow of the arcane responds to Ezra's will, but the trace is faint. A blurred vision appears in the air above the rock, of a handful of qiraji figures carrying something bulky into a cave mouth.

It's hard to discern detail, but the coloration of the cliff face is similar to that of the cliffs to the north. Saeren remembers that the cliff was one of the places where the qiraji raised the species of silithid known as the Ichneumor, which breed by laying their eggs in living or recently dead flesh.

Ezra dusts off his jacket, pokes the sand experimentally with his cane, and gestures. "Shall we?"

Nerai nods to Ezra, "I'll take point." She says, as she guides Eecee along the dusty trail.

With Ezra's magic providing the correct direction, Saeren has no trouble finding the trail of Valstann's maleficent pallbearers, despite the clear attempts to conceal it. Soon the trail leads into desert scrubland - spindly trees, cacti, and other desert flora provide sparse ground cover.

The sun is beginning to set on the mountains as the party draws closer. The trail leads toward one of the caves that dot the cliff face. In front of the cliff are two doughty qiraji warriors, along with a more slender qiraji with a miniature silithid wasp on his shoulder.

For Saeren, the first shot is a matter of pride. And pleasure. The first two arrows fly true. In a burst of fire the small wasp is destroyed and the broodmaster is not far from the same. In this fight, the night elf is silent as death.

Ezra has no worse luck. He conjures a bolt of fire and hurls it with effective precision, striking the broodmaster squarely in a gout of flame.

The giant beetle standing beside the broodmaster chitters in outrage as it hears its master's strangled cry, and skitters directly toward Nerai, releasing its broodlings as it rushes across the sand.

With one of the qiraji out of the way, Ezra begins releasing his arcane missiles at another - the one closest to Nerai's steam armor.

Nerai pulls her rifle out, halting Eecee in his tracks, and taking a line on the approaching Swarmer.

Two more arrows whistle through the air, striking the qiraji warrior who is just a bit too close for comfort. The creature is struck hard and scalded, but keeps to its feet. For the first time, Saeren makes a sound in the battle. "Hmph."

As the qiraji rush past Nerai and head for the back line, Kagarn lets loose the forces of nature he'd been channeling. In a single blow, the myrmidon is reduced from the prime of health to a smoldering - but still formidable - wreck.

Nerai watches her target swarm past her, and suddenly a new thread is upon her... THe swarmer links up.. Nerai drops her rifle to the ground, and pulls out her Broadsword, ready for the assult.

One of the giant soldiers finally gets within reach of its tormentors, but its enormous lacquered-carapace blade slices the air beside Saeren to no effect.

As the qiraji rush toward himself and Saeren, Kagarn plants one of his totems into the ground and utters a prayer to the spirits of the earth. Around him, earthen tentacles rise up, attempting to grab and catch at the bug-men.

Nerai swings her sword overhead, the sharp edge of her heavy broadswork neatly cleaving the Swarmer across it's back, taking a sizable chunk of carapase with it.

In return, the Swarmer and its offspring attack the steam armor, only to discover the superiority of technology. The broodmother's mandibles clack on empty air as it tries to shake off the wounds, while the broodlings crawl all over Eecee's hull, chewing ineffectually at the armor plate.

Saeren fires two more times at the Qiraji, and both shafts strike home. The enemy is apparently too stubborn to die just yet, and keep on their feet.

Nerai swings her sword again, this time in a more latteral motion.. Eecee's mighty frame crashes the edge of the sword between the two plates of the Swarmer's carapice, gaugin out a thick ridge with her blade.

Kagarn grins as he backs slowly away from the hopelessly mired qiraji warriors, and points at one of them. His grin fades only slightly when the lightning flickers along the creature's lacquered armor to no effect.

Nerai seems to pour lots of hurt into the bug, but it seems to keep coming back for more. As the Swarmer's mandibles try and graps Nerai and Eecee, she pulls them apart with Eecee's should hand. striking her sword right where it hurts, between the bills.

Saeren has had enough of the pincushion style of archery. Instead, with the enemy all tied-up, she's decided it's time to blast his brains out. Two more arrows are fired, both of these in the face. The head is reduced to a charred stump of flesh and the the enemy collapses in a heap due to this unacceptable condition.

Nerai takes her sword, gripping Eecee's controls so tightly her green knuckles turn almost white, as she presses the tip of her sword throught eh neck of the giant bug. Runnig the cold hard steel through the body of the beast. She breathes a few times, and turns back to look at her companions, ensuring that all is well.

Ezra took flight to avoid the qiraji; now he dismisses the fireball he'd begun to conjure, satisfied that his earthbound colleagues have the matter in hand. He lands nearest the corpse of one of the fallen, eyeing it curiously. "If they are under the curse of an old god as the naga are.." he mutters to himself.

The qiraji are armed and armored in the fashion of their people - lacquered silithid carapace for blades and armor. They bear no other tokens, except for the broodmaster, whose pouches contain an assortment of grubs, and who wears an golden amulet around his neck, in the form of a great eye surrounded by smaller eyes. Ezra and Kagarn examine this closely, but find little of arcane or mystical significance; it is merely a symbol of the Old God they worship.

With careful control, then, Ezra exercises some of his lesser-used magics: control over the earth and the movement thereof, bringing about an impromptu burial for the creatures. Their loss will not be discovered quickly.

With these matters attended to, the party returns to their mission to rescue the slain night elf hero. The cave goes into the hillside for less than a hundred yards, terminating in a round chamber, on which a number of stone slabs have been laid.

Several night elf corpses are laid about the room, with Valstann Staghelm's having pride of place in the center. And standing over Valstann's body is a giant wasp, with a wingspan over ten feet.

As the adventurers enter the room, the wasp turns its head toward them and begins buzzing its wings angrily. And around it, several of the corpses around it begin to buzz as well, as thousands of wasp younglings work their way out of the decaying flesh...
