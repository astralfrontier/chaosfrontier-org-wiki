# Turning Tides 2010-01-17

Saeren draws and fires swiftly, taking the first shot without pause. She strikes true, but just barely harms her target. "Not so easy this time," she growls softly.

Ezra has stepped forward into the cave. Now a ball of fire begins to appear in his hands as he chants, and he glances left and right, noting the corpses.

Kagarn, whose own fists have begun to crackle with lightning, calls out, "The wings! Saeren, the wings aren't armored!"

Meanwhile, the monstrous wasp's various spawn launch themselves from the corpses they'd inhabited and swarm out to surround the party, while their parent's head flicks quickly from one to the other, as if trying to decide which is the greatest threat.

The first wave of youngling wasps reach their targets. Nerai's armor protects more than adequately against the miniscule stingers, whereas Saeren finds herself beset by painful pinpricks.

Saeren fires twice, aiming now for the wing of the largest bug in sight. Even though she's faxing a lot of stinging, she keeps focus and blasts away the wing of her enemy.

As the arrows fly, Ezra's fire follows. The queen's wings receive a tremendous blast as fire erupts around them.

Nerai trudges Eecee's frame along, carying the ineffectually swarming bug along with her, away from her friends.

With that business temporarily concluded, Ezra surrounds himself with a crackling inferno of sorcerous fire, wary of the remaining insects.

The swarm of bugs shies back from Ezra's flames, and swarm around them, seeking less hazardous targets - namely, everything else in the cavern that moves.

Nerai hoists her sword, her own hardened metal carapace covered in the carapaces of various small bees. A few of the wasps fly across her visor , causing her to lose concentration, her sword missing wide.

"Saeren!" barks Ezra. "Get closer!" He fires a bolt of arcane energy at the silithid swarm surrounding the night elf, dislodging a few of the creatures.

The mage has begun another chant. "Kagarn, you too! Near the flame!"

Nerai manages to clear the wasps from her visor, and takes another swing at the bug, seeing it's left it's left flank exposed. She pulls her sword around, making what looks to be a true attack, but mama jumps away at the last second.

Kagarn, distracted by the bugs crawling and stinging at him, hurls the lightning bolt straight into the ground beneath him. He shakes his head in dismay, and calls out to Ezra. "Coming!"

As the younglings continue to chew at Saeren and Kagarn's exposed flesh and Eecee's armor, the queen wasp grabs hold of Eecee with both its front claws. It rears up, bringing its tail to bear, and thrusts forward, only to have its aim spoiled as Nerai shifts the battle-machine's weight at the last minute.

Ezra expertly shapes his spell. Carefully chanting, he weaves a complex pattern of flame around Kagarn, surrounding the tauren without singeing him - hopefully - using the fires at hand as his tool.

Nerai struggles against the creature's legs, attempting to wrench herself free from it's grip.

Kagarn holds very still as the flames burn the swarm of insects off him. As the fire flows away from his left hand, he shapes it into a mystic gesture, mumbling a brief orison to the spirits of air... and a breeze picks up around Saeren, picking up the insects surrounding her and blowing them straight into the flames surrounding Ezra.

The insect's enormous stinger punches forward, and this time strikes home - and the insect's bulk is so great that it manages to puncture Eecee's armor and scratch Nerai. Just a scratch - and yet, she has only enough time to yell "Poison-" before she feels her limbs stiffen, and she slumps inside her armor.

Saeren takes careful aim, knowing the natural armor of the enemy outmatches a casual shot. With her stung body relaxed, she is able to focus her mind and send forth two shots into the eyes of the beast. Both strike true, knocking the enemy flat, but not yet killing it.

Ignoring the insects that still crawl over him, Kagarn continues to maintain the light breeze blowing past Saeren, singing even more of the bugs as they struggle to stay out of the fire and make their way back to the target.

The seriously wounded giant insect struggles back to its feet. Its tattered wings flutter as it turns its head back and forth, feathered shafts protruding from its ruined eyes.

Realizing that they're all in trouble if the queen is not kept away, Kagarn turns toward Nerai and calls out to the spirits again - and Nerai feels sensation return to her limbs.

Nerai manages to get Eecee's arm around the pomel of her sword and grash the heavy steel blade into the side of mama bug, taking a large gauge with it.

Buzzing its ruined wing, the queen tilts its head roughly in Nerai's direction and swipes blindly with its front claws, but succeeds only in grasping at air.

With the target blind, Saeren seeks to add death to injury with another two shots. "Figure it out and die, curse you," she spits out. It doesn't comply, but it is flat on the ground once more.

Nerai manages to get her blade on it again, but takes only a little piece with it.

The giant silithid has taken massive punishment, but clings to life by a thread. It staggers once more to its feet, flailing its front limbs wildly for balance.

Carefully, Ezra has been manipulating fire around the shaggy healer. Now at last his efforts have paid off.

Nerai stares at the bug for a second, watchign the attacks lang on it's battered and wounded frame. She stares, takign Eecee's hands, gripping the handle and the pommel of the sword, she swings through the bug's neck, her hand resting on one of it's jaws.. Renting the nead fron the bug's form, Eecee holds up it's head, she turns around slowly.

"Nice cut," calls out Saeren. "Now let's get going." She pauses, turning to Ezra, "Please get these damn bugs off of us, first."

Stretching out his hands, Ezra shapes his sorcerer's fire deftly. The silithid swarms writhe and roast under the purifying touch of flame, but not before they've done their own harm. Saeren and Kagarn bear scores of tiny wounds.

"Well done, Ezra Pyreborn," says Kagarn, staggering slightly. "Mmm... lost quite a bit of blood there," he comments as he stumbles toward Valstann's body. "But first... must ensure that the abomination has not befouled the young night elf's flesh."

Ezra dismisses the fire with a wave of his bandaged hand and slumps down on the cave floor. "Not an eassy thing, no," he whispers.

The tauren kneels beside the mortal shell of the late Valstann Staghelm. "We are fortunate," he says, reaching into his healer's pouch for a sharp pair of tweezers. "The eggs are only freshly laid." He reaches into an almost undetectable puncture in Valstann's flesh, and withdraws an egg scarcely bigger than an infant's thumb. "I would guess it is a full day before these will hatch. Let us find a place that is less frequented by the qiraji."

Saeren's knowledge of the area is rather old, but her general understanding of nature is never obsolete. With some care and observation of the terrain, she is able to find a cave that is free of occupants. "They won't use this save as a last resort, it's a bit colder than they like. It'll work fine for us, though."

"It will do nicely," Kagarn says, as he lays his half of Valstann Staghelm on the cave floor and busies himself with removing the remaining ichneumor eggs. "We must rest before we attempt to reach Un'goro Crater."
