# Turning Tides 2010-02-13

The sands of Silithus are hot, and the land is desolate. What little grows here is tough and thorny, sending its roots deep to greedily suck away the moisture it can find. That which lives here is hungry and desperate and dangerous because of it. Ezra's booted feet leave their faint marks in the sand as he walks. Every so often he glances behind him. And eventually he announces that he will wait behind for a few moments, and catch up with the group. He finds a rock suitable to sit on a few dozen yards off the trail, and plants his cane firmly in the sand next to it.

Kagarn pauses, leaning on his own gnarled staff. "It is unwise for strangers in this land to be too greatly separated, Ezra," he says. "If you wish for privacy for a moment, we will travel some distance ahead and wait for you there, within earshot."

Ezra looks up, seemingly surprised by the voice. "Come here, Kagarn," he says, waving to the tauren. "Perhapss you can ansswer this riddle for me, yess."

Kagarn nods to Saeren and Nerai. "We will be along shortly." As the others move on over the edge of the arroyo, Kagarn approaches the rock. "What is on your mind, Ezra Pyreborn?"

Ezra points with withered fingers at the footsteps in the sand. "There. Look," he whispers. But it's just sand, after all. "Desert, a thousand yearss prior to any of uss.. a disstant army, the dead sson of a foolish father being lugged about sso that we may bring him to life again, yess."

"The matter that most struck me, Ezra," says Kagarn, "is that we seek to rescue the son from death at the hands of one army of Old God minions, that we may enlist his father against a different Old God." The shaman ponders the traces of the party's footmarks - faint indeed, for Saeren has been instructing them on the basics of concealing one's trail.

The others have gone beyond earshot - or probably have, given Saeren's considerable ears. "Yess, but.." He rubs his bandaged hands together briskly, dislodging specks of sand from it. "You at leasst are a member of the Earthen Ring, yess. Thiss.. is in a way your duty. I.. I was just a linguisst, yes. Ssent to Kalimdor for my knowledge of languagess and old ruinss. This has..." He leans forward, staring down at his own feet planted in the sand. "One can only get so far on bravado. I am feeling.. overwhelmed, yess."

Kagarn stares at Ezra for a moment, then moves to stand beside the rock. "Is there room for another here?" he asks, gesturing.

Ezra shrugs and waves a hand at the rock.

The shaman settles down beside the undead mage. "Ezra... where shall I begin?" he says. "I was once a simple village shaman myself. My horizons did not extend far beyond the plains of Mulgore. I sought only to ensure that our tribe was in harmony with the spirits of the land."

"And when we first caught the Twilight's Hammer encroaching on one of our wells," Kagarn continues, "I would never have imagined that the resulting journey would take me to the frozen fields of Winterspring... much less here." He shakes his shaggy head. "And perhaps it would not have... except that the Twilight's Hammer had proven to be beyond the power of my tribe alone to vanquish."

Kagarn looks up into the dust-clouded sky. "I could not stand against them alone. And we lost four of our finest braves when they fought us off. It was only when two shamans of the Earthen Ring came to our aid that we prevailed. And in turn, they came to us in pursuit of those selfsame despoilers - and told me that they were but the first tendril of a larger threat to my people."

"Even then, I did not join them right away. I spent a week in meditation with the spirits... and perhaps, my decision was biased. The spirits had been injured by the Twilights' meddling, and they were eager to take a broader revenge on their assailants." Kagarn nods to Ezra. "But even then... that particular coven of the Hammer was a threat only to the plains of Mulgore. My journey further came about in my communion with the Earthen Ring, and the problems faced by other members."

"There is not one single thread that led me from my humble village to the deserts of a distant land centuries before I was born," said Kagarn. "It was instead the end of a long chain. As I overcome each threat, I grew larger - and thus became prepared to deal with a larger threat in turn." He pauses. "Your growth has been in the course of dealing with a _single_ threat, one that imperils the entire world. Perhaps that is why you feel overwhelmed?"

Ezra shakes his head. "You have a point, but.. conssider. Your life, as you desscribe it, has always been in the purssuit of safety. Yoursself, your tribe and kinfolk, your larger fellowship. You reacted to dangerss presented to you. Is this not so?"

"This is so," replies Kagarn.

"I.. I came in ssearch of knowledge, I suppose. A warning to the Horde had to be given, becausse the naga endangered Razor Hill and later other things. But... nothing that I hold dear has been assaulted by the naga. No. Not... but one thing." He looks down at his hands, turning them over and back, staring. "Jusst a memory. Even my kinsmen sometimess serve the naga, yess. And to go against them, I have.. something that may not even be real. I have been told that I have a family that yet.. exist, I suppose. That I can somehow lead them away from.. ach, it's too vague, there's no point. Through the time portal here, I was assaulted by one of the Bronze Dragonflight. He ssealed away my swarm-shifting ability, yess. I had committed ssome unknown crime by using it. And so I ask myself.. why am I even here?"

Kagarn regards Ezra silently for several minutes. Finally, he asks, "What forms of knowledge do you consider valuable?"

This doesn't take the wizard long. "All knowledge is valuable, of coursse," he answers. "The lore of combat magic - of coursse a Forsaken wizard traveling abroad would know it. The hisstory of the world - for even now it comes back to haunt us. The ssecretss of vanished poeple, now rising again. The hidden myssteries of the powerful and influential, that one may be ssafe from them. All knowledge, yes."

"By that measure, then," Kagarn says, "is this expedition not valuable? It is certainly valuable to me, by that measure." He gestures around him. "I have learned much about the troubled spirits of this desert - which I may never have visited, were it not for the need. And soon, if the spirits are willing, I will be traveling to the legendary Un'goro Crater and learning of the wildlife there." He nods to the south. "And I am learning of the qiraji. And _that_ is knowledge that I fear may one day be useful to me by my _own_ measure. C'thun may sleep in our time, but he too will someday awaken. If that occurs in my lifetime, I will be the more ready for it because I was here, now."

"But I am not sufficient to this!" shouts Ezra suddenly. "Look at us! The son of the leader of Teldrassil is strapped to our comrade's steam armor. We face the wrath of an entire army if we fail, and merely risk their deadliest patrols in trying to escape this hell. I didn't come here for knowledge. This is too much. This--" He stops as abruptly as though he'd been hit by a hammer.

Kagarn is silent again, but this time maintains his silence. Whatever epiphany has stricken Ezra must be allowed to play out.

"That child." The wizard fishes in his pockets. "No, the amulet. I gave it to that blood elf.. What did he say?" Ezra thinks back. "Yess. Yess. I think I have it," he mumbles. Grabbing his cane, he begins stalking in the direction of Nerai and Saeren. "Come, Kagarn! The riddle is solved, the knot is broken."

Ezra strides with purpose. "I know what he said!" he shouts behind him. "It was in Thalassian. 'The eternal sun guides us.' The blood elves and the night elves, perpetual enemies, yess! Moon and sun in opposition? No, complementary! Think to your people, tauren, think on them. 'May the eternal sun watch over thee!' Even you have seen it!"

The wizard seems on the verge of some mad rant. "The Forssaken and the night elves. Opposites in every respect. Loverrs of nature vs. abominations in the sight of it. Alliance stalwarts vs. Horde allies. Yet here I am, and here I work, and here I will give my last ounce of flesh and strength for this night elf youth, scion of that preposterous, overbearing fool! _Because I am a father too!_"

Kagarn says nothing through all this - giving only a knowing smile, which he takes care that Ezra does not see. He knows this manner of speech, as he remembers reacting in like manner himself, the day that he first realized that he could commune with the spirits. And he remembers tales from druids he has known, describing their first hearing of the voices of nature. He does not know this particular revelation of Ezra's though - and for that very reason, he silently wishes Ezra Pyreborn the best in following it where it leads.
