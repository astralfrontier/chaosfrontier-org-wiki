"We have a long journey ahead of us," Kagarn says. According to Saeren's knowledge of the terrain, it is nearly forty miles to Southwind Village. That would be a day's travel under normal conditions; with the need to cover the party's tracks, it will be more like two days. But as the pandaren say, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

The first day of travel is relatively uneventful, if stressful. As Saeren notes, hiding a trail is easier in the desert - fewer twigs to snap, and the only unambiguous sign of passage is footprints in sand, which is easily smoothed. The party even crosses a few qiraji patrol trails, which they are careful not to disturb.

However, traveling in the desert presents hazards that the inexperienced may not think of. For example, the living members of the party face the dangers of sunburn and thirst, and whenever the dust in the sky clears, everyone is potentially susceptible to blinding from the glare.

Kagarn's experience with the nomadic tauren comes into play here. The plains of Mulgore are a very different environment from this parched desert, but some of the survival techniques are still applicable: drink before you think you need to, shade yourself from the sun, and so forth. The party finally makes camp as night falls, with no worse effects than an unusual amount of talkativeness from Ezra Pyreborn, who appears to have reached some sort of epiphany during the day.

On the next morning, however, the party faces a nearly impenetrable thicket of brush. Saeren finds it nearly impossible to make a passage that she can cover up afterward. Thereafter, she spends more time looking back, just in case - and as the sun creeps up the sky, her vigilance is rewarded with the glint from something shiny near the horizon. Her attention being drawn, she can make out a few other moving shapes: qiraji.

Saeren hisses softly under her breath. "I haven't done my job," she curses. "We're being followed. We're going to need to do something to break free of this unwanted attention, and swiftly."

Nerai looks at Saeren. "There is little honor in ambush. There is less honor in being ambushed, however..."

"My people are hunters," Kagarn notes. "Ambushing and being ambushed is a way of life with animals. Why should it be different because some animals walk on two legs?"

"We are unconcerned with honor at the moment anyway," says Saeren. "I only care that they die or we get out of their range. Since the latter is unlikely, the former may have to do."

Nerai mutters under her breath, "You may be unconcerned..."

"There iss another option," suggests Ezra. "There iss a spell of entombment in the earth. It iss.. difficult to use properly in battle, merely taxing to use now. I can place you each in the earth and withdraw you once the patrol has passed, yess."

Nerai blinks, "ANd we come out.. alive?"

Ezra nods.

Kagarn rubs his chin doubtfully. "Several of my fellows know a technique like this. The subject is put into suspended animation until the entombment is reversed. In this case, however, one of us must remain conscious, and to do this, they must find some way to breathe-" He trails off and grins suddenly at Ezra.

"It is faster. I have no desire to waste time fighting them. We have work we must do," says Saeren. "And there's no guarantee we can win a fight, in any case."

Nerai shrugs. "Alright. What do we need to do?"

"Ssimple. Don't resist," Ezra chuckles. He whirls his cane dextrously in one hand, then uses the tip to strike Nerai's steam armor and utters three sonorous-sounding words.

The power of magic whirls and swirls the desert sands around Nerai, reaching up with particulate tendrils and taking hold of the steam armor, Valstann, everything the goblin carries. And in the twinkling of an eye it's all sucked under the sand. No sign is left, only the ponderous footprints of the machine.

The effort takes enough out of the wizard that a few minutes of rest are necessary between castings. He's mindful of the time as he suppresses Kagarn, then Saeren, burying them to sleep for a time underneath Silithus. One final casting follows before he himself goes under - a spell to reshape the sands around the abrupt end of the party's footfalls, introducing some vaguely clawlike marks. Whether they are meant to suggest hippogryph, dragon or something else, Ezra has no intention of stirring the qiraji into enough curiousness to start digging. Let them search the skies.

It is none too soon. When Ezra first checks for any sign of the qiraji patrol, he already sees signs of their passage. There is a smattering of partially obscured footprints, in the peculiar clawed style that Saeren had pointed out to him as qiraji tracks. In addition, the magic that allows him to see through the earth also shows him that some large silithid had burrowed through the sand far above him. Fortunately, this appears to have only been an attempt to help cover the tracks - there was no sign that they made any attempt to burrow deeper.

There is no sign that they are still there. They had probably gone on their way at least ten minutes ago - Ezra is uncertain, but he would guess that their path took them to the northeast.

Thirty minutes later, when Ezra looks again, the desert is still silent. The wind that perpetually sweeps over the dunes is already filling in the qiraji tracks.

Ezra is the first to emerge, and his own eyes confirm magical vision - no sign that the qiraji are still here, and no sign of movement on the horizon. The others are brought up once more - Kagarn, still caught in the meditative pose he had adopted when Ezra buried him. "A... fascinating experience," he says, and elaborates no further.

Saeren emerges without comment, making an immediate check of the shifting sands around her. "This time there can be no mistakes."

Saeren's more expert opinion on the departing qiraji tracks confirms Ezra's guess; the patrol is headed northeast, apparently returning to their usual route after having found nothing actionable. There is no danger of encountering them as the party travels further south.

"Earth is potent, but tiring to work with and stubborn," mutters Ezra to Kagarn while Saeren scouts. "Thiss is why the Kirin Tor favored fire and frosst, yes."

Nerai busies herself silently checking the various joints and other parts of Eecee for sand and grit. He's pretty resilient, but it never hurts to check.

"More stable and reliable, though," Kagarn replies. "Fire can be fickle, and on the plains it can be as much a danger to the adept as to the foe. As for frost... Mulgore is a temperate environment, and frost spirits seldom stay long. It takes your brand of the arcane to invoke them in a place where they do not belong."

Saeren rises from her work, "We go on."

The rest of the trip passes uneventfully. On one occasion the party must pass through dense brush again, but this time there is no sign of pursuit. If they were followed at any point, there is no sign. Perhaps no patrol crossed their path, or perhaps the patrol lost the party's trail at some point. In any case, by the time the sun sets, Southwind Village is visible in the distance.

When Saeren had last seen this place, it was apparently intact, if beset by qiraji. Now it is in ruins. Walls are torn down everywhere, and those walls that remain standing are scored in patterns that resemble writing - insults in the qiraji native tongue, most likely. Through a rent in one wall, she can see the half-burnt remains of a ruined building.

Fortunately, this time the party is feeling refreshed. They had already begun to learn from their experience the previous day, and this time there are almost no physical problems. Nerai suffers from a little mild sunburn, but nothing that an extra ration of water and a bit of salve from Kagarn won't fix.

The only downside is that the time dodging the patrol has left them short. It is still at least a couple more hours' journey to Southwind proper - though perhaps that won't matter so much, since the plan never involved the entire party entering the ruined village, in any case.

In the dying sunlight, Kagarn indicates a shadow on the dunes in the distance. "I see a rock outcropping with a sheltered area beneath. I would guess that the area could be a shallow cave as well - perhaps fifteen feet in any dimension."

Kagarn and Nerai beat feet over to the cave, holding up inside to talk about what the Tauren and Goblins have in common...

The sheltered area also proves to be an ideal place for the party to rest for the night, and prepare for the morning, where Saeren and Ezra will begin their expeditions into the ruins of Southwind.

There is not much cover between the party's worksite and Southwind Village, but Saeren makes use of every bit there is. The party completely loses sight of her after she crosses the first dune, and sees no sign of her since.

Neither, apparently, do the qiraji - though she sees a few signs of them. Not very many, though - she sees qiraji moving through the village in pairs or trios. They are not searching for night elves, but belongings - small, light, and useful items, such as weapons, or gems that can be used for their dark rituals. Even if they were searching for night elves, though, it is unlikely that they would have found Saeren.

In due course, Ezra casts his spell. From his end, he is in the shelter, watching Nerai get set up. His interest in knowing Saeren's condition and findings is clear.

Saeren can 'hear' Ezra's call and can confirm that she's found an appropriate shelter, with enough cover to suit their needs. The light presence of Qiraji looters is clear in her mind, but they aren't after the things she seeks.

With an abundance of magical energy to work with, and no pressing time constraints, Ezra busies himself with the initial teleportation. This one will be more difficult, given that he's only capable of seeing it through Saeren's mind and not in truth.

At the end of the ritual, the wizard vanishes - and reappears near Saeren, exhausted but smiling. He nods silently, breaking the link and settling into his hiding spot to regain his strength.

Saeren looks around one more time, then gets back to work. Even though they are outnumbered badly, having even a silent partner present makes her feel more at ease.

After an hour and a half of searching, and avoiding qiraji looters, Ezra is the first to make a solid find. It was apparently once a sentinel post, but there is a supply of about three dozen spare uniforms. From eyeball estimate, Ezra and Saeren guess that they'll provide a little over a quarter of the cloth Nerai will need.

With a load of cloth, Ezra makes one dangerous trip back to the shelter. He fails his visualization twice, but succeeds on the third try. With his cloth delivered, he teleports again to the city - and slumps down, for it'll be another hour befor he has strength enough to attempt this again. Still, he reflects, this is better than when he hadn't mastered the arcane flows enough to do this but once or twice a day.

Nerai starts to unhooks and sort the clothing as Ezra and Saeren scout for more. She is able to show Kaeren a useful organizational method, that allows her to get some of the clothing stiched together in the pattern and general shape they will need, as she awaits the other two returning with more supplies.

The search continues, but with no further successes. Either Saeren's memory of the layout of Southwind Village has gone stale over a thousand years, or the qiraji have been pillaging cloth after all. On the bright side, though, she believes she's managed to guess the qiraji looters' pattern, and feels confident that she can search behind them undetected.

Now that they can move without fear of detection, the search is more fruitful. Saeren finds an additional clothing store, and Ezra finds a tailor's stockpile. And in addition, he finds something else. This tailor apparently specialized in enchanted clothing, and he finds an intricately cut quartz crystal, clearly designed to shape local mana flows.

Again the wizard takes the recovered materials and returns them to Nerai; again he magically places himself back inside the village's perimeter.

The qiraji looting parties are starting to catch up, but Saeren makes a final discovery - this time in a cellar. There are signs of valuables ripped from the walls, but the cloth has been left behind. No qiraji will visit here anytime soon... and Ezra can rest as long as he needs to make the final trip.

A final armful of sorted cloth, carefully arranged for easy lifting, accompanies Ezra through space and back to Nerai's work area. He hopes silently that this is the last time he'll need to visit that particular village, but smirks in gratitude that the qiraji lack the wisdom to employ arcanists.

With Ezra safe and clear, Saeren makes her escape. For her, the departure is marked with a renewed hatred for an old enemy. Every bloodstain adds ice and fire to her focus. It will not consume her, but she will not forget. Perhaps when she's settled her debts to the cursed Naga and Murlocs her arrows will find their mark in the sands once more.

Nerai starts to direct the effort more in earnest, allowing the other two some much needed rest as she and Kagarn continue their effort. She scribbles some on some notes she had been thinging as she was given this task, and she nods, "I'm fairly certain this will work." SHe says, to noone in particular.

Nerai works with the others to create the envelope, which is nonestly the most time consuming part. She manages to adapt a design her had for a horse (don't ask) in order to create the mechanism for turning phlogiston into hot air. The green flame flickers a bit in the wind of the desert, as the GOblin stand in the basket, looking at her beat, and wary companions, Nerai herself invograted by the effort, "We're ready." She says.

With a bit more bulk to move, it takes some ingenuity to keep tracks minimal. Fortunately, Saeren is able to allow the shifting sands themselves to do most of the work. By following the ideal path, the winds themselves eat up most of the evidence, leaving the night elf with a much more managable task.

The faded dull blue of not oft used uniforms fills the sky with a damper, somber tone that clashes with the brilliance of having filled a patchwork baloon with superheated air. She calls for Saeren to get in, as the envelope finds it's full inflation, and begins to pull on it's tether. With everyone onboard, Nerai cuts the rope, and the team is airborne.

There are tales of how goblin inventions tend to explode disastrously...

...but today, those tales do not come true. The makeshift balloon lurches a bit, but quickly begins to gain altitude. Soon, the balloon is rising into the air... going _north_. Kagarn turns to Ezra. "Do you know the ways of altering the shape of the wind?"

Ezra shakes his head. "Not across ssuch an area.. but perhaps...."

The intrepid wizard works his magic, whispering the secret words in Kalimag that remind the local spirits of the air of the ancient pacts that mortal wizards have made with them.

Kagarn shivers as he feels the spirits respond. Air whirls around the balloon and shapes itself into a whirlwind hovering beside the balloon. The voice seems amused, as it speaks in Kalimag: "Ground-bound beings, what brings you into my domain?"

Kagarn nods to the spirit, apparently understanding the being's intent. "O Spirit of Air, we seek assistance. This contrivance of ours needs a little push, to the west. Could we prevail upon you?"

Ezra recognizes the creature's 'accent' after a moment, and given its altitude and aspect, privately concludes a few things. "Not so much of one that it disintegratess," he adds. "We'd have to assk more night elves to undress for uss if we had to build another."

The elemental exhales a gust of laughter. "From the looks of it, you needed an army to make _this_ one. I had better move you closer to where the night elves actually are, or you'll never find enough." The elemental's form dissipates, but soon the balloon is flying eastward, fast enough that the basket-framework built around Eecee rocks backward. As the adventurers sail into Un'goro Crater, they can hear the sound of chuckling all around them...
