# Turning Tides 2010-04-10

> (OOC) Log "Tides-2010-04-10" started by TidesGM at Sun Apr 10 17:55:13 2011 CDT (OOC)

> (OOC) Sookie says, "startlog?"

Saeren's eyes flutter open to the blurred sight of a white-robed dwarf bending over her. She's lying in a cot inside a tent - apparently the field hospital on the Maker's Terrace. Her right arm and left hip are still throbbing where the rifle balls struck them. "How are ye feelin', lass?" asks the dwarven priest.

> (OOC) TidesGM checks Saeren. Feel free to ask questions.

Saeren lets out a deep sigh and takes a moment to look around her. "Feeling?" she mumbles, the cobwebs clearing out a bit. "I guess.. not dead? That's a start, isn't it? My pride may never be the same, though. Is everyone okay?"

"We are all well," Kagarn says. "You have Sookie to thank for your survival, though. She retrieved you and then dealt with the Dark Iron ambushers. Quite... violently."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone is welcome to be present for this scene. If so, pose in. I'll presume Nerai is busy working on Eecee unless Brendan turns up and wants to be included."

> (OOC) Sookie is present but not sayin anything for now

There are footsteps outside the tent, and then the voice of Commander Gravelbeard. "Is she awake?" he asks. "Aye, but she isn't goin' anywhere for a while yet," replies the priest. "Good, I need to talk ta her. Give us a few minutes." The Maker's Terrace commander files into the tent, making way for the priest to depart, then looks at the night elf. "You all right, lass?" he asks softly.

Saeren smiles, directing her eyes to the blue that most resembles Sookie. "Thank you, Sookie. I'm sorry that I made you do such a thing." She turns her attention to the commander and manages a nod, "It's nothing that can't be fixed. Next time, I won't act like a fool and forget everything I've been taught."

Sookie fidgets, but says nothing.

Gravelbeard looks at Saeren, and then raises his voice to full parade-ground volume. "Damn straight! What do ye think ye were doin', goin' up against trained riflemen with no bloody cover? What do they teach ye in bloody sentinel school, flower arrangin'?" Before anyone can respond, the dwarf straightens up and addresses the other adventurers. "And the rest of ye are just as bad! You!" he yells, pointing directly at Kagarn. "Are them totems of yers just fer show? Cause ye sure didn't use 'em for much else in there!" Kagarn bows his head slightly and says nothing.

"And as for that bloody stupid goblin, I'll give her this much credit. At least she figured out _after_ the fact what a bloody steam armor is for, cause she's finally workin' on it so that it's the slightest bit of use against bloody rifles!" He throws up his arms in frustration. "Titans' teeth, the only one of you lot who had the slightest bit of sense in fightin' is the bloody kid! No offense," he says quickly, nodding to Sookie.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Unless someone wants to interrupt Gravelbeard in mid-rant, he's got one more."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Go for it n.n"

The dwarven commander calms down, but only slightly. "Tell me, Saeren. Have ye ever heard of the concept of a fireteam?"

> (OOC) TidesGM notes: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireteam

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Saeren will be familiar with the concept, if possibly not by that name. If you can come up with a suitably night-elveny word, you can use it."

"A fireteam?" asks the Sentinel. "Not that word, exactly. And I'm not accustomed to facing firearms, honestly. Next time.. I assure you they will not have the opportunity to see me."

> (OOC) Nerai interjects.

Nerai walks in from the same door that Gravelbeard used, "One tactical mistake." She states plainly. "ANd how many of your dwarven fireteams would have wisely withdrawn at that point, and how many would have pressed ahead for their Honor, Sir." She has a bag with her, and a smile on her face.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "A what?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "a bag, perhaps? :)"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Bag, yeah. :("

> (OOC) Nerai says, "My typist today."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Fixed in the log."

"Well, that depends on what their team _was_, lass," replies Gravelbeard, turning to address the goblin tinker. "If they had a _proper_ steam armor with 'em, one designed ta go up against riflemen, they'd ha pressed forward, usin' the steam armor as cover, threw some smoke bombs ta the back of the room ta flush 'em out. If they was just riflemen themselves, they'd've gone back fer reinforcements. A good fireteam leader knows when they're overmatched." He looks around the room. "Which one of ye lot is the team leader?"

Sookie stiffly points a finger up at Kagarn, but says nothing.

Saeren lets out a sigh, "In battle, I imagine Kagarn would give that nod to me. Just too much overconfidence. A mistake I don't intend to duplicate. I'd appreciate it immensely if we could move away from the piling on of blame to something more productive." The elf moves to push herself up to a sitting position. "Like seeing what's in that bag."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Does Gravelbeard have anything? Nerai would pause to let him respond."

"This isn't about _blame_, lass," says Gravelbeard gruffly, shaking his head. "This is about ye knowin' what went wrong so's ye don't do it again. An' with all due respect, Saeren, if ye think the only mistake was somethin' _you_ did _personally_, ye ain't done thinkin' yet. If ye're leadin' the team in combat" - he pauses to look at Kagarn, who nods - "then yer also responsible for makin' the best use of yer teammates. Not just chargin' ahead on yer lonesome. A solo sniper's great against a few targets, but a whole team o' riflemen will wipe the floor with ye, no matter how good ye are."

Saeren nods, "Fair enough," she manages. She is able to sit. It seems to surprise her. "And you are right, I went beyond my mission.. which I gave myself. I need to obey my own orders for a change."

"Good enough," Gravelbeard says. "Knowin' be half the battle, as they say." He finally smiles, nodding to Nerai's bag. "Now let's see what Greatfather Winter brought us fer Winter Veil," he says.

Nerai holds up her bag, "Well, I did some tinkering on those noiseboxes that we were playing with before, and I found some portable ones." She looks in her bag, "At least, if you're close to Eecee they should work." She pulls out the throat radios from her bag. "This way you can hear when you give yourself orders, and when you ask for more info, you'll be able to hear yourself." Nerai gets a confused look on her face, "Or something."

Gravelbeard seems just as baffled. "Uh... why don't ye show us, lass?"

Saeren looks at Gravelbeard, then turns to Nerai. "I must have taken a blow to the head on top of the rest.. I think that almost made sense."

Nerai pulls a strap around her head, a speaker close to her year, and a mic down on her throat. The device is somewhat clunky, and not exactly the height of fashion. She nods, and then hands one to Saeren, helping her into hers, "Now what I talk.. Saeren should be able to hear it through her speaker. Like so." She presses a button on the device, "Testing... 1.. 2.. 3.." She says.

> (OOC) Nerai says, "COmmical reactions welcome.. of course. :D"

> (OOC) TidesGM will be waiting for Saeren's reaction first.

Saeren looks at Nerai, "Um, perhaps you shouldn't be all of two steps from me during this test? Just a thought." She looks down at the box with a bit of wariness, "It's not going to explode, right?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "My faith in goblin technology is rising. :D"

"Wait..." says Gravelbeard, suddenly fascinated. "So these doohickeys of yers let ye talk to yer teammates across the battlefield? Without shoutin' and givin away your position? What's the range on them things?"

Nerai looks around, "Well, I haven't tested them, but you'll probably start having problems at a quarter mile or so. Being inside or in caves will significantly reduce the range." She looks, "Of course, you can build a larger model, with a proper engine on it, with a lot of power that could go..." She looks around, "A long ways."

Gravelbeard strokes his chin contemplatively. "Could I borrow one o' them things fer a minute?" he asks. "I wanna try somethin'."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "If he gives me another lecture via walkie talkie.."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "He's done lecturing for now. n.n"

Nerai rubs her chin and gives him one of the devices, "Sorry, it was meant for Kagarn... so it might be a bit big." As she hands it over, and indicates, "Here's the button to talk.

Gravelbeard nods. "Good enough." He walks out of the tent. A few minutes later, Gravelbeard's can be heard - it's scratchy and staticky, but still quite understandable. "Can ye hear me? Nerai, can ye hear me?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I must afk for food myself for a spell :)"

Nerai pushes the button on her headset and respons, "I'm reading you, Sir." She says, quite proud of herself.

"Titan's toes," says Gravelbeard, barely audible over the static. "I'll be right back." A few moments later, Gravelbeard turns up, short of breath. "Do ye... do ye know where I was when I called ye? I was in the command tent. Which is warded against magical scryin'."

Nerai taps her chin, "Well, it seems like we need to find a way to block this sort of communication, too." She thinks, "Maybe some wire mesh.." She looks down, and starts to reach inside of her apron, and fiddle with a tool a bit.

> (OOC) Nerai says, "And in THIS bag over here I have a GAU-8. n.n"

"Aye, aye," Gravelbeard says. "But until the Dark Irons get a hold of this... this is _huge_. E'en if ye do come up wi' some way ta block it..." He pulls a small fist-sized ball from his pocket; it has an ear carved on one face and a mouth on the other. "See this? It does the same sorta thing yer dingus does, only with magic - but obviously they don't work too good through magic wards. Having two _different_ things, that work on different principles..." He looks at Nerai. "How... how much for the schematics, lass?"

Nerai looks at Gravelbeard. "Schematics! I knew I was forgetting something." The Goblin smacks her forehead. "How about I work with a few of your engineers, and help them get some of their own up. I'm sure I know more than a few of them... Is Gus still around? He could probably handle it."

Gravelbeard looks dumbstruck. "They told me ye weren't like other goblins, lass, but I didna truly believe it till now. Aye, aye, by all means. While yer there..." He scribbles something on a small slip of parchment and hands it to Nerai. "While ye're there, tell Gus that he's ta help ye set up Eecee with rifle armor."

Neari smiles, and moves to hug Gravelbeard.. then thinks better of it. Instead she takes the letter and starts off at a run, "Thank you sir!" She calls out behind her, running her way to Tinker Town.

> (OOC) Nerai says, "I'm very interested in handwaving the whole 'make radios improve Eecee' bit."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "As am I, along with the whole 'increase Eecee's DR' bit."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone else have anything? Saeren, you back yet?"

> (OOC) Sookie has nothin at the moment, but will when Saeren gets back

> (OOC) Sookie says, "actually I got somethin if Nerai doesn't"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "This is a pretty big deal, though. Eye-Ear Amulets that don't cost the holder FP to use will revolutionize WoW warfare."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "the Power enchant will do that, but okay :)"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "They're probably heavy and costly to mass produce, but I dont' have anything right this second."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Cost to maintain either Eye or Ear is 2 FP per minute. Power 2, IIRC, puts it into the 'expensive' bucket."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "true"

With Saeren still recovering and Nerai running about on errands, Sookie turns to Kagarn again. Unlike her rough and uncaring Common, her Kalimag is fluent - it's a language she cares about speaking. "(Master, what are they talking about? Let's just slaughter all the Dark Irons. Why are we talking about these metal boxes?)"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Gah, sorry, back.. I just realized I didn't pose my afk to eat ><"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Or wait, yeah I did.. weird mushclient >.>"

Kagarn rubs his horn for a moment, then responds in kind. "(You cannot slaughter _all_ the Dark Irons by yourself, Sookie. Perhaps all the ones in Uldaman - but there are vastly more. These metal boxes will help Ironforge deal with far more than you could handle alone.)"

"(You underestimate me, Master,)" Sookie answers calmly. "(I could kill them all. And... that is what you ordered me to do. Kill all.)"

"(We will see,)" replies Kagarn. "(When Saeren is recovered, we will venture in again.)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anything more from Sookie?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "not until Saeren is active again"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm up, should I pose mobility? Not sure how out of it I am :)"

> (OOC) Saeren poses anyway :D

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Saeren could probably limp, but the left leg won't really support your weight. n.n"

Saeren has never been one to lie about for long, and so she finds herself on her feet and getting back to her normal work as soon as possible. And generally without any permission from her healers. Evading them should prove easier than dodging bullets, though her stealth is impeded by the walking staff she's using to help with her left leg.

More mobile than any dwarf priest, and probably more experienced with hunting prey, Sookie does manage to find Saeren. Abruptly confronting the elf, she holds up her forearms, the metal bracers prominently on display. "You talk about order. Take order. Know why now. Now you be glove too."

"Glove?" asks Saeren curiously. "Mostly, I was a fool. I'm sorry it caused you trouble, Sookie. I'm not supposed to do that. Not to you, or anyone."

The girl gets a strange look on her face, then dashes off without saying another word.

Saeren looks confused, and would give chase, but after her first few steps realizes that she's never going to manage it. "Sookie! Wait!" she calls out.

> (OOC) Sookie is gonna run away and go hide

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Is Saeren going to try to find Sookie?"

Saeren looks down at the ground for a moment, and with the speed she can muster, hobbles off after Sookie. If the girl didn't take to the skies, Saeren will find her. Eventually.

> (OOC) Sookie will be hiding in a far off corner. feel free to show up

It takes time, but Saeren isn't one to give up the hunt, and the trail isn't hard for her to follow. The few who take note of her leave her well alone, as it's clear she's on a mission.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "bah, sorry, was distracted"

Sookie has been hiding out. But as Saeren approaches, it seems like she's willing to be found. She says nothing, content to watch the elf approach.

Saeren draws close and settles herself on the strength of the staff with a worried look. "Sookie, are you okay? Why are you running away from me?" she asks. She wobbles for a moment on the stick, then shifts her wait surreptitiously to a more balanced pose.

The girl shrugs, but stays silent.

"Thank you for saving my life," says Saeren. "That's what I wanted to say to you most of all."

"What goshi want," Sookie mutters.

Saeren looks at Sookie for a few silent moments and moves closer, reaching out a hand, "I want you to be happy. Truly happy. And free."

Sookie recoils away. "Dark Iron still live. Not happy yet."

"What do the Dark Iron have to do with your happiness?" asks Saeren.

"All die," Sookie answers, looking up with an angry expression. "Then happy."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "one moment, phone call.."

"Why do you want them to die, though?" asks Saeren.

Sookie fidgets even more. "'Cause," she says finally, staring away. "Kagarn traitor to Horde. Not care what people say. He like human and dwarf and elf, so he traitor. Simple. But he goshi, must serve. Dark Iron enemy of dwarf. Fight all Dark Iron."

"Being friends with me doesn't make him a traitor to his people, Sookie," says Saeren. "Nor does my being a friend with him make me a traitor. It makes us real people."

Sookie mumbles something under her breath. And only a little louder: "Dark Iron hurt friend of goshi. Fine. You real people. Dark Iron enemy no matter what. Kill all enemy. Keep goshi's friends alive. Happy now?"

"No, because there might be some Dark Iron that aren't our enemies. Not really. It's not that simple, Sookie." Saeren eases herself down to the ground. "At least, not that simple when you are responsible for your actions."

"If all die, no goshi's friends hurt, 'kay? That supposed to be right." Sookie is clearly getting frustrated, by the sound of her voice.

Saeren tilts her head, looking at Sookie in silence for a time. "I suppose that is true. So you just don't want to see us hurt? What if there were other, better ways to do that?"

The girl folds her arms over her face. "They die, goshi's friends okay. Know better way? That pretty reliable, 'cept for if they undead."

"It is reliable, but killing doesn't feel very good," replies Saeren. "Saving people doesn't always require killing, Sookie."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "doesn't /always/ require.. fixing pose."

"Feels fine," replies Sookie, sounding a tad petulant. "Good at it."

"I know you are good at it, but I doubt it feels fine at all," replies Saeren. "I've done it plenty of times."

Sookie turns away. "Nothing wrong with killing monsters," she whispers.

> (OOC) TidesGM has disconnected.

> (OOC) TidesGM has connected.

> (OOC) TidesGM gets connection back, reviews scrollback. You guys still discussing this?

> (OOC) Sookie says, "yah, waitin on Nerai to show as well"

"That's true," says Saeren. "Now let's go back to check on the others, okay?"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Hmm?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "you around and good to RP with us? :D"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Sorry, I've been here forever. Just didn't join in."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "good to go back"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Me too. Nerai, pose what yer doin :D"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "NOTHING... OK.. posing."

Nerai is working with Gus on Eecee, of course. They're just retrofitting some new 'active armor' onto Eecee. They're wrist deep in the mecha, Gus at one of the legs, and Nerai in the cockpit, trying to get the leg armor to react right. "Fire It again!" The male Gnome cried out. Nerai pushes a button, and the engine revs up, and starts to make quite a racket. "Finally! Good work lass!" Gus cries out over the noise. "Hi Folk! DOn'T MinD The Mess!"

Saeren looks over the works with a bit of wariness and calls out, "How is it going?" She silently prays that it won't explode as she waits for a response.

Nerai shuts down Eecee, "It's going great. I think he'll be able to deflect some rifle shots now." She smiles, "Unfortunately, the armor itself is active, so he gets kinda loud while I'm using him. But that's no different than most of the time. How are you guys?"

Saeren wobbles slightly on the walking staff she's procured and gestures to Sookie, "We were just enjoying a little walk. I'm telling Sookie I'm basically battle ready, but she doesn't seem to believe me." The elf nearly falls over in the course demonstrate said readiness by flourishing her sai. "See? Just say when and I'm there."

Nerai smiles politely at Saeren, "I'm sure if needed you could take on the world today. But I would prefer to wait until there's no risk of long term damage." She looks worried for a second, "You will recover, yes?" Nerai nods hopefully.

"In time," says Saeren. She looks to Sookie, "Thanks to Sookie I will get that chance."

Sookie says nothing, and looks away.

Nerai nods, "Sookie really did save the day back there." Nerai smiles, "I should thank you too. That was a very brave thing you did. It makes me happy to see Saeren whole. As it does to see you whole." Nerai smiles plesantly, and calls to Gus, "I think we're done for today. Let me know if you need help with the magicless ears."

Saeren looks at Sookie and sighs. "Well, in any case, we're back and we're all okay." She wobbles again and adds, "Mostly okay. I guess it takes a while to put people back together. With all the fighting, I'm sure they have mastered the process."

"Far easier to ensure that they do not become dismantled in the first place," says Kagarn, who has been watching Nerai at work. "And we can help with that as well. I must discuss with you, Saeren, what the spirits can do for us in hostile territory."

"Na, goshi." Sookie speaks again, but hesitantly. "You say Saeren give order in combat. That order for me?"

Kagarn ponders the matter for several seconds. "Sookie, I am not trained in the art of war, as Saeren is. In the heat of battle, I cannot be counted on to give the correct orders." He looks to Saeren. "Can I count on you to do so? To give the orders that will ensure _all_ of us the best chance at survival?"

Saeren smiles at Kagarn, "That's what I intend to do, yes. I promise in the future to be more careful with myself, as well. Still, as leader, if a situation should arise, understand that I will protect you all... and trust you to do your best to put me back together if the need should arise."

Kagarn nods. "Very well then. Sookie, when we are in battle, you will be taking orders from me - but _I_ will be taking orders from Saeren. So when in a fight, you will obey her as I do."

A thought pings into Nerai's head, and she turns to Sookie. "I think this is an important distinction to point out here. We will all be taking 'orders' from Saeren in the heat of battle because Saeren is the leader. We all trust Saeren to get us out of battle, and not to tell us to do things we shouldn't. It's a relationship built on trust."

Sookie eyes Nerai. "No understand distinction," she says after a few seconds. "Tell me who kill. I listen to Saeren, 'cause goshi say that what he do."

Nerai looks back at Sookie. "Yes. But if Saeren told me to kill you, I wouldn't do it, because I know it's not the right thing to do."

"Maybe I controlled by enemy," Sookie points out calmly. "Maybe that best."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Now /this/ is something Saeren should be able to understand."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "I don't understand what SOokie is saying, and will say as much. c.c"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "please do"

Nerai looks at Sookie, "I... I don't understand."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I will pose."

Sookie holds up her arms, showing off her bracers. "I elemental. Bind me with magic, I obey. I hear talk of friends and trust. No matter. You cast spell, I obey."

Saeren looks to Nerai, then to Sookie, "In war, there are sacrifices. Sometimes, for the greater good, some must make the ultimate sacrifice. That's what being a warrior means. It is not a pretty life we live, it is not perfect, but because of what we do, others live free."

Nerai looks at Sookie. "Yes, part of you is Elemental, and part of you works that way. But part of you is Human. And Human need friends." She shrugs.

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Unless you're in charge of the Night Elf fortress, then you substitute sticks in your bum."

Kagarn speaks up again. "And there is another point. Elementals can be bound by magic... but so can goblins. So can tauren. And so can night elves. The concern Sookie raises - it could happen to _any_ of us."

Nerai smiles, "Indeed Kagarn. ANd even then it would take more than a simple word for me to kill any of you."

"When it happens, I trust all of you to do what is right," says Saeren. "So.. Kagarn. How long before I'm actually ready to do some good again?"

Kagarn looks at the crutch. "Not long. Two days, perhaps." He grins. "Three, if you continue to aggravate your wounds."

Nerai says, "So, probably four then, knowing Saeren..."

"I aggravate everyone sooner or later," agrees Saeren. "Why should my injuries be any different?"
