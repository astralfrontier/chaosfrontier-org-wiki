The Defiant sails over the once-vibrant forests of Tirisfal. Though the trees still live, the forests are somber and quiet; not so much a sense of virulent decay as the stillness of the grave. The Scourge left its mark on the land, and its present inhabitants have little interest in revitalization.

A seemingly rickety tower of gray wood serves as the anchoring point for airships. Unlike at Everlook, docking permission is not so much a matter of direct payment as Ezra's identification as a member of the Apothecary Society; though goblins still operate the zeppelin tower, the Undercity pays the bills wholesale.

Even as the goblin dockmaster is inspecting the paperwork, one of the Undercity's Deathguards approaches. "Ezra L. Pyreborn?" he asks. "The Dark Lady would have an audience with you."

Ezra tips his hat politely and smiles.

Ezra is not led to the main audience chamber; instead, there is a small doorway along the main hallway, leading to a smaller private room. Sylvanas Windrunner waits inside, along with the banshee Sharlindra and two elite deathguards. She nods in acknowledgement to Ezra, and his escorts bow and depart, closing the door behind them. "Welcome back," says the Queen. "Report."

Ezra rubs his bandaged hands together. He has been anticipating this meeting since Kalimdor. Now he must take what feels like a lifetime of experiences and condense them into a succinct, easily understood form. Once again he feels inadequate, like a man stumbling through the darkness and finding his feet reach the edge of an unseen precipice. He pauses, then speaks.

"My Lady. An Old God named Dagun has awakened, yess. It ssendss itss servantss - the naga, and their slavess ssuch as the murlocs - in a bid to ensslave the surface world. Through the use of a magical chalice imbued with the Old God's curse, they sway the minds of the living. Through perfidous promisses to our Forsaken brethren, they have managed to co-opt an unknown number of apothecaries and otherss, yes. The Warchief knows of thiss." This last fact must also be made clear, and he casts a brief wary glance at the woman known as the Banshee Queen.

"The naga ally with certain of the goblins, those of the Venture Company. They have managed to sstage themselves inland in northern Kalimdor, and laid ssiege to the elves' landss. Through, ah, diplomatic overtures taken by memberss of the group I travel with, I believe that the Earthen Ring, the Cenarion Circle, and otherss within the night elven culture will stand together against this threat."

"Finally, an antidote to the naga's own curssed condition has been discovered, yess. A counter-chalice. The resulting creatures, called lamia, work with uss to create more ssuch devices."

Sylvanas nods as she contemplates the summary. "You have done well, Ezra Pyreborn. You bring ill news, and yet you also bring hope as well. Let us speak more of these rogue apothecaries, the ones who aid the naga. Most of the confederates of Daniel Bates followed his route - feigning their destruction, then departing in secret. Others, though, remain ostensibly within the Apothecary Society and yet aid his schemes, as with the group you encountered at Maestra's Post.

"It is the latter that concerns me the more," continues Sylvanas. "There is one bright spot; from your reports, they still imagine themselves to be serving my interests. But before we can hope to bring them back into the fold, I must know more about them; their goals, their methods. Why they feel that they must hide from me to serve me."

"I have already sent you to investigate them once before. Now, I require something deeper and more dangerous - an inside agent. I need someone who is willing to feign an interest in them, to gain their trust." Sylvanas taps her chin. "I know only two things on the matter: that they feel that the Forsaken must take a more aggressive stance against our living foes; and that they have some interest in _you_, personally."

A moment passes. Ezra's body begins to dissolve. He whirls apart, transmuting into a bronzed sandy cyclone. A few seconds are all that's necessary for him to regain his humanoid form. He doffs his hat and unwinds his bandages, revealing flesh and blood beneath. He is Forsaken still, but alive. He extends his hands for inspection. "I believe I have just the thing, my Lady," he says wit a smirk on his lips.

The Dark Lady seldom shows emotion; the presentation of her sister's locket is one of the few occasions where she has been seen to do so in public. Perhaps it is merely the privacy of this interview that allows her, on this occasion, to gape in astonishment. The deathguards are less reticent about their reaction; one nearly drops his pike. "This is not the illusion of the Veil of Vitality, Ezra Pyreborn," says Lady Sylvanas at last. "What _is_ it, then? What have you accomplished?"

Ezra withdraws the Veil from his pocket, and presents it. "It had no name until very recently, my Lady," he replies, honestly. "The Forgotten Shadow is both right and wrong. Right, in that the Light is not our path. Wrong in that being a dark reflection of the Holy Light is not adequate. The Shadow we propose to live in is just that - a shadow of something else, something larger and greater. My Lady, I have found _fire_. The courage to act, the will to do, the desperate struggling to satisfy my eternal hungers. All of that is inside me. The fire reaches out, touches that power which I may happen to wield - arcane sorcery, the ambient power of nature, whatever - and transforms it."

"I have found the Sacred Fire. I will bring it to the Forsaken. And to the Horde. We need not be the enemy of the living. We may _complement_ the living. Be the things they cannot or dare not be. They will be that which we are not. We the Forsaken will be in this way with the Horde. And we the Horde will complement the Alliance. All of us will have a place in this world. We will struggle to find that place and with this Sacred Fire we will achieve it!"

Sylvanas narrows her eyes. "I have spent much effort in encouraging the Cult of the Forgotten Shadow, and many have found comfort in it, have found strength to resist the continued attempts of _him_\-" she glares grimly northward - "to reclaim us. Now you present a new way, a new path for my people to follow. I cannot argue with results, but this is a difficult thing to accept."

Ezra nods slowly. "I know it will be," he says with a sad smile on his face. "I know." He reaches forward to offer his hand. "But... my Lady, would you like to live again?"

Sylvanas reaches out and touches the pale hand lightly with her fingertips. "It is warm," she murmurs. "And it is no illusion...?" She glances back at Sharlindria, as if for confirmation, and the banshee nods.

"It will be a difficult thing," says Ezra with a smile. "You have led us through many difficult things in the past. You will again. We will follow you. And... indeed, it was... an aspect of your leadership that led to the creation of the lamia."

Ezra continues. "I wish to present to you the Lady Asprah. In private, you may speak to her of the song that led her away from Dagun and to renew her vows to Elune. That song is called the Lament of the Highborne."

The Banshee Queen withdraws her hand, clasping it with the other. At length, she speaks again. "I must set an example for my people," she says softly. "There are many in the Undercity whose hatred for the living is so great that they will not accept a living ruler. But perhaps they hate out of despair. If they had hope again..." She seems to recover herself. "You have my leave to attempt to kindle the Sacred Fire amongst my people. I wish you the best of success."

The Dark Lady then smiles slightly. "And I will be most pleased to speak with this Asprah. She is the first of her newborn kind, is she not? The estranged offshoots of the quel'dorei may yet find much in common after all."

Ezra nods slowly. "What I can give, my Lady, will leave you both alive and undead. Able to freely partake of whatever .. suits your needs the most. I will not make my people become something they hate. But I promise you that I will give them the gift of choice." He bows, intent on taking his leave. There is still much, much more to do.

"One last thing," says Sylvanas, and now her voice is very quiet. "There is no mention of the name of Timothy Lammas in the records of the Undercity, or in Lordaeron that once was. A suspicious lack of mention."

Ezra feels his fingernails bite into the palms of his hands. "It is a.. a code word, my Lady. Nothing more. I don't believe there is such a person. But, I will go see what our.. stray flock have to say for themselves."

Sylvanas inclines her head. "I had worried that they might turn even you, Ezra Pyreborn. I worry no longer. Go then. Show them the way home."

Ezra returns to the airship. While at the moment Lady Asprah is in demand by Sylvanas Windrunner, and Saeren is naturally solicitous of her well-being, Nerai and Kagarn remain unspoken for. The wizard, then, calls them together for a brief discussion.

"The _Defiant_ may be well sserved by ssome new, eh, equipment," explains Ezra. "And there iss another thing, yess. The Scourge necropoli fly under the animation of magic or ssome other dark art. While I ssincerely doubt the goblinss had any hand in their principless of levitation, it sseems to me that the most potent arm against a sea-going force is that which flies, yess. I will be investigating this possibility. To that end we will need many things. The firsst thing would be an alchemical laboratory."

Ezra pats his pockets. "My fundss are ssomewhat lacking after Everlook. However, I wissh for you both to help me identify perhapss cast-off or disscarded materialss from the ruins of Lordaeron, and perhapss from Undercity, that may prove .. useful."

Nerai looks at Eecee in the corner, "I didn't ever spend most of my cut from the elves. An alchemical lab would come in handy for a great many things. Maybe we can buy most of what we need?"

Ezra shrugs. "We will likely be buying much for your ssteam armor as it sstands, yes," he admits. "I believe that ssome of our alchemical products and ah, processes may be of interesst to you. The Forssaken will not part with them cheaply, though. Come with me into the Undercity and we will ssee what is useful, yes?"

Nerai nods to Ezra and walks back to Eecee to pull her stff out for a visit to Undercity.

Kagarn raises an eyebrow. "An airship is insufficient for your needs?" he asks, smiling. "I will be glad to help, nevertheless. Especially if it means that we will be able to depart from this stricken land all the sooner."

"Airshipss do not carry armies, no," Ezra replies.

---

The gray and forgotten stonework of the capital city of Lordaeron gives way to the sewers, which have seen considerable expansion since their inception. Ezra leads the way. Unlike Ashenvale, there is no immediate hostility here. If certain of the Forsaken dislike a goblin and a tauren, it is not because of factional hatred, but simply a distrust of those who still breathe.

In the time before the Scourge, the denizens of Lordaeron were primarily of human stock, with a goodly number of high elves; and so it is for the present residents of the Undercity, though they all call themselves Forsaken.

There are exceptions, though. In the depths of the Rogues' Quarter, in the section reserved for those of a tinkering bent, the Forsaken known as Brightflame Masjenal was clearly a dwarf in her living years. She still speaks with the distinctive brogue of Ironforge, though with the rasp common to most of the undead.

Ezra leads the way, with Nerai in tow. Along the path, he realizes something. "Kagarn, certain of the Forsaken deal with... ahh, plagues. I would undersstand if you were inclined not to follow uss all the way." With that made clear, he makes his way further into the twisty warren that is the Apothecary's work areas, finds one of the assistants, and asks for some time with Masjenal.

Nerai is somewhat amazed at the experence, as it's explained to Nerai. She never really thought about Forsaken tinkers before...

Masjenal is not hard to track down. "Ah, Ezra," she rasps. "Yer always welcome to visit. Who is it that you have here?" She nods with stiff courtesy to the goblin. "Ah. Not here ta buy up our secrets, are ye?" she asks with a slight smile.

Ezra clasps his hands together. "This ah, this is Nerai Escapement," he says. "A steam warrior and inventor of some sskill, yess. She has been an invaluable aid to me in my.. work."

Nerai nods back to Masjenal, bowing as she does so, "If your secrets could mearly be bought, I doubt they would be worth the offered coin, yes? Most secrets must be earned, I have found." Nerai blushes at the high praise.

Ezra nods. "You will find her not at all the mercenary sort," he explains.

"Not tha mercenary sort?" Masjenal asks, grinning. "Are ya sure yer a goblin, lass?" she asks, turning to Nerai.

Nerai smiles a bit brighter, "I'm more a Goblin by way of Ironforge..." She lets out, reaching back into her toolbelt, and fiddling with her tools in her claws.

The nearby Forsaken suddenly cringe, moments before the obscure widget Masjenal had been working on is smashed against the table. Cogwheels and springs fly out in all directions. "RIGHT!" yells the Forsaken dwarf, a surprisingly loud voice. "Did ye come here ta insult me?!" She leans forward, glaring at the goblin tinker; she does not actually have much of a height advantage over Nerai, but she nevertheless seems to be looming over her.

Nerai cowers as Masjenal rages against her current project, "No... No.." She calls out, bending down to snatch up one of the cogs that rolled near her boot, "It's the truth..." She explains, proffering up the cog to the forsaken. "I studied in.." She pauses, ".. that place. It made me what I am today..."

Masjenal slaps the toothed wheel from Nerai's hand. "Shut up shut up shut up!" she yells, her corpse-breath wafting over Nerai as she rants. "Get outta here! Never talk ta me again!" She picks up her gadget again and throws it bodily at Nerai, and she stomps her foot as she continues to rant incoherently; if her salivary glands had still worked, she seems as if she ought to be frothing at the mouth.

"Ah! We've caught you on a bad day," says Ezra suddenly. "Come Nerai, I think we'd besst be leaving now, yess." He grabs the goblin by one hand, keeping the other tucked into his coat pockets as he tries to slink out before the pair are killed.

Nerai glances to the side, and looks up at Ezra as the pair step quickly out of the workshot, "I'm sorry I angered your friend, Ezra..." She begins.

Collecting Kagarn on the way, Ezra hustles his allies out of the Undercity. Only once they are well away from the gates, and the prying eyes of the deathguards, does the wizard pull his other hand free of his coat pocket - and what he's clutching there is a thick sheaf of notes, and some odds and ends. He lets out a sigh. "I knew that would happen," he says. "Once again I've stolen from allies in the name of the greater good, yess." He looks down at Nerai for a moment, then hunkers down a bit more to put himself at eye level. "I assk for your undersstanding and forgiveness. For the sake of my family, for the sake of the Forsaken, I musst now seem to betray my people. You were my distraction, yess. But that creature in there.." He glances at the distant stone walls. "I will teach her to adopt a living form again. I will give her freedom to return to the Ironforge of her heart." And he smiles at Nerai. "She will be redeemed, yes. And when that day comes, I want you to really get to meet her."

Nerai looks at Ezra. "Wait. You KNEW that would happen?" She shifts her eyes at him, "You could have at least warned me." She shakes her head, and looks at the ground, then back up to Ezra, "Sometimes you don't need to trick people to get them to go along with you." She sighs. Not angry enough to storm off or make any other move. "I hope she gets back to Ironforge."

Kagarn peers at Ezra, his eyes narrowed. "What are you up to _this_ time, Ezra Pyreborn?" The tauren has typically been quite forgiving of his allies' peculiarities, but this time his tone is deadly serious.

"The Forsaken musst be unified, my friend," answers the wizard, gesturing to the south. "And... my family. Whether they have been turned by the chalice, become undead, or ssomething else, I know not. The prophecy I received was dire but nonspecific, yess. To win back their love and safety, and to unify the Forsaken, I _must_ avert the civil war which is brewing between the followers of the Dark Lady, and those who ally themselves with the naga. And so.. I musst seek them out, and seem to join with those who have strayed from the true path. I musst convince them that there iss another way. And it musst satisfy the needs of their heartss. I believe I have a way to do thiss, yes."

"I see," says Kagarn, and looks away. The tone of suspicion in his voice is lessened, but not quite mollified. "I pray to the spirits that you know what you are doing. And that you are on the right path."

"The ancestors of the dead of Lordaeron would weep for what has befallen their kin," answers Ezra curtly. "Assk them if they would prefer jusstice or ssettle for vengeance. It iss for those of uss still walking the world, who sstill feel the bondss of family most keenly, to find another way."
