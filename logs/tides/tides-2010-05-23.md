# Turning Tides 2010-05-23

Though the majority of Daniel Bates' conspiracy has been rolled up, there are still a few loose ends. Daniel Bates himself is still at large, as are a number of the senior apothecaries and deathstalkers he took with him. There are a few known cells, such as the one at the Sepulcher, which must still be dealt with. And, of course, their original plan to infect the Scarlet Monastery had included an assembly point, which Ezra had been given.

Sylvanas convenes a strategy meeting, this time openly, in her throne room. Ezra, the architect of the conspiracy's downfall, is clearly invited, as well as whatever entourage he chooses to bring. So, too, are the least untrustworthy of the senior ex-conspirators, particularly Commander Boneshod, who has been quite forthcoming with his knowledge of the conspiracy, as well as rather more trustworthy deathguard commanders.

Ezra argues that to get the most out of the conspirators, to regain the use of some skilled apothecaries, and (most importantly) to learn more about the naga strategy, Daniel Bates and his remaining supporters must essentially choose to come in. If forced, their loyalty will always be suspect; if killed, valuable intelligence may be lost.

To emphasize his point, he brings up the simple fact that the conspirators so far have returned to (or adopted) loyalist sympathies after essentially being talked to for awhile.

Boneshod rubs his chin. "Perhaps I shouldn't be saying this, given my position, but I suspect a number of my brethren are simply going with the flow. With the conspiracy unmasked, no one here believes they are safe to defy the will of the Dark Lady. Those who think themselves beyond her reach at present, such as Daniel and his friends, may believe differently."

"With no Undercity, he musst have losst face with the naga, and can only continue to do sso," counters Ezra. "His underssea patronss are not, ah, forgiving ssortss. He musst realize this, yes. All that I assk is a chance to reasson with him, however it comess to pass that we encounter each other."

"I'm not sure if I'd count on much from Daniel," says Boneshod. "In fact, I'd like to send a force to ambush and poison the Scarlet supply caravan immediately. I wouldn't put it past him to interfere, now that the jig is up."

Sylvanas nods. "Commander Stentorus will lead the ambush, with Boneshod and a handful of his men reporting to him. You will proceed to the rendezvous point first, and ensure any conspirators there do not interfere with our plans for the Crusade."

Ezra straightens. "My Lady, there iss one more reason for you to favor a peaceful rapprochement, yess. Even if we go and apprehend the conspirators.."

Sylvanas inclines her head politely, inviting Ezra to elaborate.

The wizard clasps his hands together. "A powerful force, corrupted and transsformed from their former state? Now under the thrall of a powerful figure exerting mental control over them? And this force, now poised to overrun Azeroth and desstroy its civilizations? My Lady, whether he knows it or not, Daniel Bates still serves the Sscourge under another name. And it fallss to uss to redeem all ssuch losst souls."

Some of the former conspirators wince at this description; that analogy had not occurred to them, and more than a few seem ashamed. Sylvanas simply nods. "Daniel Bates does seem to have had a particular interest in you, Ezra. Do you wish to join Stentorus' force?"

Ezra nods. "I do."

"So be it, then," says Sylvanas. "I will leave the rest to you, and to Stentorus and Boneshod. Dismissed. The rest of you, please remain. We must discuss how to best take advantage of the disarray we hope to sow in the Crusade's ranks..."

---

Commander Stentorus' strike force moves as silently as their armor allows, with the steam armor Eecee as the centerpiece of their formation. He only allows Boneshod a personal guard, not yet willing to trust a man who had so recently conspired against the Dark Lady. Ezra with his golem Kadmon remain, along with a few other mages, well-protected in the center of the formation.

Kagarn is not to be seen; the tauren are welcome allies enough, but it would not do for one to be observed either by the remaining conspirators or by the Crusade. Saeren is also unseen, but for a different reason; she, like the dark rangers that serve as scouts, remain hidden until they are needed.

It is not long before the squadron reaches the clearing where Ezra was directed to meet with the conspiracy. There are the ashes of a long-dead fire in the middle, but the place is otherwise empty. Nevertheless, a voice hisses out. "So you have come after all."

"Daniel Bates!" calls Durthis Boneshod. "Show yourself!"

The reply is another soft chuckle. "Oh, I don't think so... traitor." The last word twists with hate. "But perhaps if my good friend Timothy Lammas were to speak with me?"

Ezra has been mumbling something as Boneshod yelled in reply. Now he disappears entirely from sight. His voice, reedy and calm, emanates from the air. "Yess. We can talk."

"And will you not show _yourself_, Timothy?" The speaker is still not evident, but the voice seems to come from the branches of a nearby tree. "No matter. So, no doubt you think you have won?"

Ezra hums, moving from his original position and looking about him. "That dependss. Won against whom? The Scarlet Crusade, who even now face their doom without knowing it? The naga, whose curse we are lifting half a world away? Or the consspiracy to overthrow the Undercity?"

"You know what I mean," says the voice, and now it hisses with undisguised hatred. "Oh, my friends told me all about this wonderful new plan you have to overthrow the Crusade - but it wouldn't have been possible without me and the naga, and you know it. But never mind that. All I want to know is, why? Why did you go running straight to your precious Dark Lady the instant you thought you knew something?"

Remembering the faces of those Forsaken in the war council, Ezra tries out this tactic directly. "Why did you _not_, Daniel? You broke free of the Sscourge. Your mind wass strong enough to esscape the Lich King's control. And with that, you allied yoursself with the naga. The former Highborne, condemned to the curse of Dagun, ensslaved by hiss will to conquer the ssurface world, physically transsformed into monstrous aberrations of their former sselves - almost as though you rejoined the Scourge, eh?"

"You dare!" The outraged hiss is almost a shout - and this time, Ezra is all but certain that the voice actually came from behind the next tree over. "You dare compare me to the Lich King, when it was through _my_ efforts that we are so close to destroying the Crusade once and for all! And all for the love of your _wonderful_ wife and child." Daniel's voice drips with scorn.

"I don't remember them," Ezra confesses. "You know that? I have.. images. Flashes. I'm.." He pauses, knowing that he's speaking in front of some of the most heartless creatures in the world, but he plunges in. "I imagine them, yess. What they musst have been like. I'm afraid to meet them, to know the truth. And to be honest.." What seems as an emotionally laden moment of silence is Ezra, whispering information to the Forsaken commander. He continues. "..I fear them meeting me the mosst. You know them better than I, I think."

Stentorus quietly nods to the unseen Ezra, and gestures to some of his companions to spread out, surrounding the tree. As they begin to move, Daniel is silent for a time. "You are wiser than I gave you credit for, Timothy," he finally says, more subdued. "Yes, I know them. Enough, certainly, to know that they joined the Crusade after your death. _Because_ of your death, I believe. You are right to fear meeting them."

"You asked if I thought I'd won, Daniel," says Ezra softly, mindful of his approach to the other's hiding place. "I assk you the ssame. Have _you_ won? Are you better off, a few rogue Forsaken serving the naga for as long as they find you usseful? You resent the comparisson, but can you really tell me I'm wrong?"

"The naga were to be just another stepping stone," Daniel Bates whispers. "But never mind. You've won, all right. You destroyed everything I'd hoped to achieve. And now you and your pet army hope to bring me in. Well, forget it! Go home, and leave me to my fate! Men, we are leaving!" And with that signal, great clouds of smoke erupt from the bushes.

A heavy wind springs up from near the cloud's origin, conjured by Ezra. He's tried to clear the air metaphorically; now he's forced to do it literally.

The dissipating clouds reveal a handful of retreating Forsaken. "Capture them!" hollers Stentorus, and the soldiers spring into action. Several of the conspirators are caught quickly, but a few signs of motion among the trees indicates that a few of them managed to get further away.

Cursing, Ezra hurries quickly to survey those captured. "Saeren!" he calls. "Some still flee!"

Saeren's response is a convincing argument. Sadly, more convincing for those in flight than Ezra's wise words have proven. Her bow sings and the two of the three fall instantly in a flash of pain and fire.

The remaining target is blessed with the full attention of the Night Elf. Saeren's two arrows both blast through her foe, sending him sprawling, his legs useless. Just before she steps behind a tree to vanish into the darkness once more she whispers, "With luck and mercy, he will walk again."

Daniel Bates has apparently underestimated his foes for the last time. As the Dark Lady's soldiers catch up with the limping conspirator, he spits at them. "Where is Timothy?" he growls. "I want to see him with my eyes one last time before you take me away."

The conspirator's request is granted. Ezra took to the air while Saeren was opening fire. Now a raging dust cloud comes to rest near Daniel Bates. But the form that emerges is not the hunched undead shape, but a living man wearing a black hat and coat, carefully removing bandages from his face to look down silently at the captive.

Daniel Bates gapes at Ezra, and then his eyes narrow. "They told me of this, but I didn't believe... what is it? Some kind of new illusion?"

Ezra kneels down, holding out his hand.

Bates reaches out, touching the pale flesh briefly, before drawing his hand away as if from a hot stove. "Warm," he hisses. "A... very convincing illusion, then." He turns his eyes toward Ezra. "It is an illusion... right?" He is almost pleading.

Ezra shakes his head, still silent, still waiting.

Daniel Bates' eyes widen in horror. "**You traitor!**" he shrieks. "You betray your best friend, you betray your wife and child, and now you betray your own **nature!**" He tries to squirm away as far as the soldiers' hands allow. "Get away from me! Get away!" He turns his face away, and though he cannot weep, his voice chokes as if with a sob. "Get away..."

Ezra finally speaks. His voice is quiet, but firm. "It's not too late. Even now."

Daniel is silent for a time. Then, just as the soldiers are prepared to take him away, he turns back, with the expression of a broken man. "They say..." he stutters. "They say you said 'I am alive _and_ I am Forsaken'. Wh-what did they mean?"

"When you are better, I'll tell you," promises Ezra quietly. "We'll talk more. Will you do that?"

"I... need time to think..." Bates said, shaking his head. He coughs, with a cloud of dust. "I'm sure the Dark Lady will ensure I've got plenty of time for that."

"We'll see each other again, then," says Ezra, tipping his hat.

With some help from Saeren, the Forsaken shock troops manage to get hidden safely to either side of the road where Boneshod has pointed out the caravan was indicated to move. The Forsaken, not used to the way the crew of The Defiant tends to run, is shaky, and eager to get to business, but luckily the arrogance of The Scarlet Crusade bares out, and the carts ramble down the road, full of supplies, foodstuffs, etcetera.

As the wagon reaches the designated point, Forsaken jump out of either side. A brief fight ensures, a few arrows flung into the ambushers. The horsemen and front guard run for it after seeing the multitude, the caravan having allowed to get just far enough to allow those in front to scamper. Saeren expertly takes down just one of the horsemen as they run, the rest disappearing into the woods. The rest guards, more along to discourage bandits than to actually protect the cargo, lay down their arms swiftly after defeat becomes apparent.

The guards are swiftly tied up, and lined against their card. With great ceremony, the forsaken part ways for Asprah. Ezra's spell shaping around her, the appearance of a naga taken upon her form. She holds the chalice aloft, and suddenly the members of The Scarlet Crusade start struggling mightily against their bonds. Try as they might, they cannot escape the infection, and soon each are forced to drink from the cursed cup.

Crusaders have a reputation for being strong-willed, but sometimes it is exaggerated - and particularly for the more or less ordinary people who grow their food or man their caravans. It is not long before they have all dunked their own heads into the water barrels helpfully provided in front of them, and one by one they come up with gilled necks. Asprah, in the guise of the naga she once was, hisses orders at them in heavily Nazja-accented Common. "Welcome to the ranks of Dagun," she hisses. "Your ordersss are to infect the Sssscarlet Monasssstery. You bear food and drink for them. You will taint the mealsssss, you will cook so as to hide the tasssste, and one by one you will enlighten your former brethren. Do you undersssstand?"

As one the tainted Crusaders call out, "Yes, my lady!" Asprah attempts a triumphant smile for her audience; it appears almost painfully fake to the Forsaken onlookers, but the enthralled minions do not notice. "Then go!" She signals to the Forsaken to unbind their captives, who carefully adjust their clothing to cover the gills, then carefully begin repacking the wagons and setting off again.

In the woods nearby there is a rustling, then silence. The Forsaken studiously ignore it, pretending not to notice that the 'escaped' caravan guards were watching the whole show.

Ezra approaches Asprah as his spell lapses, once the signal is given that the caravan escapees have gone. He's dressed as a common traveler, and looks entirely human. He's still bald, but there's nothing for it - hair was apparently not part of the deal. "Asprah, I'm sorry to put that job off on you," he says wryly. "But it had to be done. Those people live in constant paranoid fear. And it's driven them half-mad. We're doing what we can to avoid a slaughter, but.. this land must be defended against the allies of Dagun. This is the best way."

Asprah nods, still shuddering. "It... wasn't easy, playing that part," she murmurs. "I wish you luck finding your family."

Ezra smiles, eyes glancing in the direction where Saeren has waited. "And you yours. Good-bye."
