There is a standard doctrine to arrival of supply caravans to the Scarlet Monastery, and the cursed Scarlet caravan operators follow it to the letter, wheeling their wagons to a halt in a designated area within easy reach of the archers on the parapet. "Halt! Who goes there?" calls the hail from the guard commander on duty. "Supplies from Tyr's Hand!" comes the response.

Passcodes are exchanged, and the side gate is opened. As the caravan enters, one of the guards notes Ezra's presence and halts him. "Who is this?" the guard asks the caravan leader.

Ezra has come dressed as he's appeared before. This time he does so without the benefit of the Veil of Vitality - a bald but living human being, dressed in traveling garb. "This is Ezra," the caravan leader explains. "A traveler. We checked him out in Tyr's Hand when he came. Says he's from Kalimdor." In accord with this introduction, Ezra himself bows politely, silent but ready to answer if questioned.

The guard purses his lips. "And what business have you in the Scarlet Monastery?" he demands, this time speaking to Ezra directly.

"I've been searching these lands for the Lammas family," explains Ezra. "A fellow I met in my travels marked on my striking resemblance to a man of that family. Since then I've been told that they're kin, but I've never met them. I've been searching Lordaeron, wherever humans have fled to safety."

The guard's brow furrows. "Interesting. Well, it's possible that your search has found fruit. We'll escort you to the barracks, and send word to the confessor that someone might be asking after her. Please do not attempt to wander around. Thomas here says you're clean," the guard adds, indicating the caravan leader, "but you are still not one of us."

Ezra nods slowly. "Please, don't say who I am, just that it's someone," he asks. "If I really do look like kin, she'll know when she sees me. And if not, well.. I'd rather not get anyone's hopes up. More than I have lost family in this land."

"Don't we know it," says the guard, with feeling. "This way, then."

The barracks are spartan enough - rows of bunk beds kept spotlessly made. A few are occupied, presumably by the night shift. An hour passes, during which Thomas the caravan leader passes through the hall nearby. He nods to Ezra, his left hand clenched into a fist with two fingers extended - a signal that the tainted supplies have been successfully stored.

Ezra nods politely in passing, keeping his hands folded and fingers laced in penitent patience.

Eventually, Ezra hears two voices in conversation, one male and one female - and the woman's voice makes his now-beating heart leap in his chest. "-is this?" she is saying. "Why would a traveler spend so much time looking for the Lammases?" "I do not know, My Lady," comes the reply. "He only said that he was asking after you."

Ezra rises to his feet, composing himself. Thousands of miles and a transformative discovery that could remake a whole people. All for this moment.

"Fine," says the woman. "But he'd better not hope for a long conversation. I've got the evening service to-" A woman, wearing the Scarlet tabard and chainmail, comes around the corner. She would not necessarily be counted as beautiful, but her features are certainly memorable, and her raven hair is worn in the short hairstyle typical of the military. And as with her voice, Ezra's heart recalls the look of her face, even if his waking mind does not.

The woman takes one look at Ezra, and it is clear that she recalls his face as well. Her jaw drops open, and she gasps, "Impossible..." Her astonishment lasts only a moment...

...and in the next moment, her sword is drawn and pointed at Ezra's throat. "Who are you?!" roars the woman, her pale complexion flushed bright red.

Ezra blinks. "Well, ah, my name's Ezra, my lady," he says, jaw not moving quite as far as it could thanks to the presence of the blade. "I've come in search of the Lammas family."

The blade does not move, though it trembles ever so slightly. "I'm sure you have," she snarls. "This is some kind of Scourge trick! I'm sure you know full well whose face you have stolen!" The guard beside her was taken by surprise, but has drawn his own sword, uncertain of the threat but prepared to defend his superior. "Why have you come here? The truth now! The _whole_ truth!"

Ezra raises his hands ever so slowly. But one of them doesn't go all the way up. One slides carefully along the blade, and Ezra winces. He holds out his palm, cut slightly on the sword's edge, to let the confessor see what her blade has exposed.

The blade twitches slightly as Ezra reaches for it, but she retains enough control that the only consequence is that a tiny crimson droplet appears at Ezra's throat, as well as oozing from the wound on his palm. At the sight of living blood, the Confessor's face relaxes slightly... only slightly. "Guard!" she says. "Take a sample of that and take it to Doan immediately! And call for backup!"

As the guard leaves, the two are alone for a few moments. The woman says, "Who are you, Ezra? And how can it be that you look exactly like Timothy?" Her voice trembles ever so slightly with doubt.

"That name. That's the name he called me as well," Ezra says. "But that's not my name. My lady, I don't have any memory of any Lammas family. I'm a historian, linguist and mercenary mage. I've been good at those things as long as I can remember. But now I've heard that I might have kin. I came here, back to Lordaeron, after being told that they were most likely to be found here."

"My husband is dead of the plague," says the woman softly. "I set the flames in his corpse myself, so that the Scourge would not take him. And he had no brothers, twin or otherwise." She shakes her head slowly. "You _must_ be part of some Scourge plot. There's no other way you could resemble him so closely. But..."

Ezra scratches his head. "Did he have hair at least?" he asks at last.

She almost smiles. "He did. Thick auburn hair, like the sunset..." The reverie lasts for only a moment, and then her expression hardens again. "We were driven away before I could watch the pyre burn. I've always wondered if perhaps I was too late..." She shakes her head. "If you _are_ undead, this is the best illusion I've ever seen. And I've seen a few. But make no mistake, I _will_ get to the bottom of this."

"I've found what I'm looking for," Ezra says with a smile. "So, my lady, you may rely on the fact that I'm going nowhere. And perhaps when your blade rests more easily in its sheath, I can trouble you to ask about what other surviving family he may have had."

"Not yet," she says. "I still need to..." As she speaks, there is the jangle of mail in the corridor, and two guards arrive, swords at the ready. "What kept you?" she snaps. "No matter. Watch this man until Doan arrives."

Ezra sits himself down on the floor, folding his legs together and calmly breathing. He attends to the cut on his hand. It's clear that he's willing to wait as long as it takes.

Half an hour passes, before another man, in scarlet robes, bald on top but with a short orange beard, arrives. "Milady, I still can do more tests, but this blood checks out as human," he says, waving a vial with Ezra's blood sample. "And clean of any disease."

"Impossible!" snaps the Confessor. "He is the spitting image of Timothy!"

The other man turns to Ezra and draws an arcane sigil in the air, which Ezra recognizes as a spell for detecting the unseen. "I cannot discern any sign of an illusion, milady. If you give him over to me, I could do some more-"

"Do it, Doan!" the woman interjects. "Guards, escort this man to Doan's laboratory!"

Ezra shrugs and rises to his feet again.

---

Several hours later, Doan leaves the laboratory, shaking his head. His conversation is audible from within, where Ezra remains comfortably but securely bound to an examining table. "Elaine, I've done every test I know, and several more I'm uncertain of. He's completely alive and human, and his appearance is entirely his own. There's some faint signs of magic on him, but they appear to be the echoes of old spells."

"Impossible..." comes Elaine's voice, but much more subdued. "There must be some other mystery... Let me have a look at him!" Elaine strides in, glaring over Ezra's supine form, and gestures sharply. A searing bright light flashes from her hand and washes over Ezra, causing no more than a sensation of warmth.

"That's odd..." she says, her face relaxing. "You're definitely not undead. But... there's a strong _spiritual_ presence in you. Almost as if you were filled with the Light... but different, somehow..."

"This is a nice table," quips Ezra. "I'll stay here if you feel better, but sooner or later I'd like to try and work off my debt for your sheltering me here."

"Smartass," responds Elaine. "Just like..." She shakes her head. "There's still something strange going on here, but it's like nothing I've ever seen." She leans over to unshackle Ezra. "I still think you're some kind of trick, but if you are, you're beyond anything the Cult of the Damned _or_ the Scourge could manage."

"I _am_ sorry," Ezra says softly. "I'm to blame for your distress. I didn't mean to cause this much trouble by coming here."

"It can't be helped," she says. "It's a shame Andrew is stationed in Stratholme, or we could settle whether you were Timothy's kin once and for all."

Ezra blinks. "Andrew?" he asks.

"Our son," Elaine says. "Timothy's and mine, though I think he took more after Tim. As far as I know, he's the only blood relative of Timothy still among the living. Up until now, that is," she adds, peering at Ezra.

Ezra nods slowly. "I see."

"Well!" says Elaine, putting her hands on her hips. "You said you were looking for Lammases, and now you've found one. What will you do about it?"

Ezra scratches his chin. "You know, I hadn't thought that far," he admits. "I just wanted to know." A thought enters his mind and he grimaces slightly. "Well you said Timothy passed away. Plague, right? So, er, is there anyone new?"

Elaine laughs. "That's a rather personal question, isn't it?" She shakes her head. "No, I've been far too busy. So many Crusaders seeking solace, or finding their resolve weakening..." She pats the hilt of her sword. "And _far_ too many Scourge to destroy."

Ezra hums. "I see. Well, I'm sure there's not a lot of work for historians and linguists here, but I can work around the place for a couple days until I decide what to do next. Will that meet with approval from your superiors?"

Doan coughs. "Well, _I_ for one could use an apprentice archivist-" he begins, but Elaine cuts him off. "You know the rules, Doan. Twenty-four hours in quarantine for all new recruits. Yes, you checked him out head to toe, but we can't take any chances. You know that."

"As long as I can get something to eat while I'm at it," shrugs Ezra.

"Of course," Doan says, bowing and clearing the doorway. "I'll escort you to the quarantine cells," Elaine says. "And I'll make sure you have enough to eat. We Lammases have to stick together," she adds, smirking.
