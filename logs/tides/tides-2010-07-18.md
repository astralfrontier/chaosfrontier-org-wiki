# Turning Tides 2010-07-18

Sitting in Eecee, watching the Scarlet Crusade prisoners, Nerai was idly fiddling with the control surfaces of Eecee. The goblin's hands twitched over the various knobs and dials, all the while muttering under the breath, "50 quarks.. 25 degrees.. no no no.. time to oil.. " As if a dancer and singer, performing a ballet expressed only in chrome and steel.

"That's finished!" Nerai exclaimed, then looked about. Hardly anyone was giving her notice.She reaches in Eecee's hatch, and roots around in her bin. "Spanner... spanner..."

**CLUNK**

Nerai looks down, "Hmm... I forgot about you..." She says, picking up the auto piston that fell out. Her green claws pick over the little weapon. She pulls the cartridge out, puts it back in.

"Hmm..." She pulls the cartridge out again.

"Hay Saeren... Can you keep an eye on them for a while?"

"Sure...."

"And no killing any unless they deserve it..."

"Sure...."

Nerai gets that gleam in her eye, and jumps out of Eecee, waving the unloaded autopistol around. Quickly she is back at her cart, rooting around, "Paper... Paper..." She quickly pulls out a page, and the quill fires across it like hot lead. She pulls over the autopistol, and starts to disassemble, looking at the loading mechanism, the pin, the blowback plate.. Touching.

She pulls out her rifle, and quickly strips it down to the barrel. Some notes on the diagram. Some ammo is produced, and compared. More scratches.

A backup motor for Eecee is found, and she attaches a slotted disk. More pantomime with the bullets. Some more sketches.

"Okay." She says, looking at her design, six barrels, mounted on the motor. The receiver on each one

"How to load it, however..." She hmms. At least she has a friend now. Yes. Her...

Nerai runs through Undercity, goblin feet clomping along the pavement as she makes for Masjenal's shop. Under her breath she thanks the gods that Goblins at least are accepted everywhere.

Nerai runs into the shop, panting, her fist clutching a stack of papers, and a single barrel with the motor trailing off of it in the other,

"Masjenal!" She cries.

One of Masjenal's assistants steps forward, "Will you stop bothering her? She's upset every time you come by."

But the undead dwarf sticks her head out of her workshop, "What is it." Nerai shakes the half assembled... nothing at Masjenal. "I think I'm onto something." Nerai can barely contain her excitement, and tries to run into the forge.

"Now now now lass, hold off a second." Masjenal takes Nerai's plans, and looks. Hmming and nodding as Nerai bounces between her clawed feet in front of her, "Yes, child. I think this might work." Masjenal says at last, that inventor's gleam coming to her own eye. "I was working on some way to set of a string of explosives at once...." Masjenal says, "Chaining them together, as it were... I think it might work here."

---

After a couple of days in the forge, Nerai and Masjenal are complete with the prototype. It's heavy, and unwieldy. The barrels are each a slightly different shade, unevenly mixed in the fury of activity.

"Still heats up a lot. Plus I don't think an Infernal could fire it." Masjenal says.

"Ah.. for that I have a plan." Nerai says, eyes the half formed steam armor in Masjenal's shop, "Eecee should be able to handle it.. even when hot."

"We shall see..." says Masjenal.

The Scarlet Monastery has yielded, among other things, large amounts of raw materials for enchanting. When Ezra approaches the arcanists with a request for some small part of this, they regard each other with wary glances but don't hesitate to supply it. So far he's brought results; so far he's been steadily supportive of the Undercity's most powerful faction. Whatever these men think of that, they know it's not wise to meddle with the influential.

He comes away with three rings, pocketing them quietly, and a good supply of worked leather and dyes. He piles it all into a monumental sack and trudges back out, heading for the airship, cackling all the way.

---

The first leg of the airship journey is uneventful, if dour. The Defiant floats serenely above the devastated landscape of the Plaguelands. Whereas Tirisfal Glades was merely cold and quiet, the Plaguelands seem actively toxic. An orange haze obscures the ground, and Kagarn's nose wrinkles at the unmistakable stench of decay that reaches even the airship's cruising altitude.

The Defiant gives a wide berth to Caer Darrow, home of the Scourge's school of necromancy known as the Scholomance. However, it seems they did not give it a wide enough berth. As the ruins of Caer Darrow fade in the distance, Saeren's eagle eyes spot a cluster of five specks, about a mile behind, heading directly for the airship.

Saeren draws immediately, and calls out, "We have five friends coming to visit from Scholomance!" She's already taking aim. "Not sure what it is yet, but they are heading right at us."

Nerai blinks up, and heads back to the control surfaces. Her hands stretch out,a nd grasp around the wheel, looking back at teh incoming specs, ready to try and hold them off, ass needed.

As the shapes draw closer, details become clearer. By the time the rest of the party can see the first signs of movement to the rear, Saeren can pick out the details. The interceptors appear to be grotesque bat-like shapes carved out of stone: gargoyles.

Ezra and Nerai have been working on a project on and off since liftoff; the wizard working, with his golem Kadmon assisting, and Nerai providing information and suggestions. Now the fruit of that labor pays off. Ezra yanks away the heavy cloth covering his work area. What rests behind it is a new golem. But not just any golem.

The new construct is made of sturdier stuff, with heavy armor plating over its entire body. Its arms are bulbous and powerful-looking. Hurriedly strapped to them are several cylinders of metal, affixed also to some complicated machinery. A belt of bullets feeds from a storage drum into both contraptions. Ezra strides toward the controls, tossing Nerai an amulet as he goes. "Vickers!" he yells. "Move aft! You will take instructions from Nerai's voice."

One of the specs goes falling from the sky with Saeren's first volley. As she draws out her next arrow a small smile crosses her lips. "Four to go."

Nerai catches the amulet out of the air, and points at the gargoyles, yelling as she does, "Vickers! Open Fire!" THe cannon whirrs tremendously, the barrels cycling at a phenominal rate of speed, the whine from the motor almost deafning. Then it gets louder, the muzzle flairs a white fire as it sends hot lead down in the direction of the gargoyles, each of the 10 shots popping together in a second of deafining lead death being released.

"Remember the qiraji," suggests Ezra, peering over the railing. "Aim for the wingss as they draw closser, yess."

Nerai screams over the whine of the motor, "Go for the wing!" She yells, though Vickers pulls the shots a little wide of mark 2.

Saeren shakes her head at the strike and sighs as the strikes to the wing seem to do little at all. She draws her arrows and falls silent once more.

Vickers comes to life again, sending more lead out of the cannon of death. This time, he managed to clip the qing under Nerai's guidance and the already brittle control surface crumbles unde rthe abuse, and the gargoyle falls out of the sky, plunging into the orange miasma below.

With one miss and a clever evasion, Saeren frowns. "Time for a little rain storm," she growls.

"Will a bolt from the blue suffice?" Kagarn rumbles beside Saeren. He has been standing at the railing, murmuring prayers to the spirits of the air. Now he unleashes the forces of nature; lightning arcs from his outstretched hand and strikes the gargoyle. The creature cracks slightly - and completely freezes in mid-flight, plummeting helplessly to the earth.

Saeren and Nerai continue their barrage. The toughness of the gargoyles still makes it nearly impossible to score a killing blow, but bit by bit they wear away at the foe. As they draw near enough for Ezra to open fire, one of them is so heavily pockmarked and scarred that it's a dark miracle that it still flies at all.

The foe is drawing ever closer, and more arrows and arcane missiles plink off the damaged one; Kagarn has been biding his time, though, and calls down the wrath of the spirits once more. The second gargoyle, untouched up until now, explodes in a shower of stony shrapnel.

The engine if fiery metal death roars to life, finally reducing enough of the gargoyle's control surfices to holes to make it fall uncerimoniously into the yuck below.. The autocannon stops spinning, and starts smoking. Nerai runs over, "Wow that doesn't get half hot doing that..." She comments, her little goblin clows twitching to get a hold of it and see how it held up. "Vickers worked great, Ezra..."

Ezra grunts. "At leasst we know they won't warn the Sscarlet Crusade that we're coming," he replies.

Kagarn falls to his knees, breathing heavily; the exertion of calling upon the spirits has taken its toll. "The creations of the Scourge are disturbingly durable," he says.

"Thank you," replies Ezra sardonically, tipping his hat.

As the Defiant eases down onto the brown grass near Light's Hope Chapel, the paladins that protect the Argent Dawn stronghold cluster around it, looking astonished. "Ahoy travelers!" calls their sergeant. "We have not seen an airship in these parts since before the War! How did you survive the Scourge air patrols?"

Nerai looks at Ezra and clears her throat, "We aren't as defenseless as we might appear." She smiles at them as they come down the gangplank. "A bit of a gargoyle problem about?"

"They only ssent five," Ezra replies dismissively. "We ssent you a whole monastery earlier. Did you receive it yet?"

Another paladin, with insignia denoting very high rank indeed, pushes forward through the Dawn patrollers. "At ease, Sergeant," he says. "You must be Ezra Pyreborn and his companions. We have heard much about you. I... have my doubts about your methods, but I cannot argue with the results.

Ezra hobbles out. "May I pressent Nerai, free and independent goblin; Saeren Finblighter; and Kagarn Stormhoof," he croaks. "We're here because we want to get into Sstratholme, yess."

Nerai looks up at the paladin. She bows before someone obviously important. "I assure you, most of our enemies are felled by metal and magic, the same as yours."

"I am Lord Maxwell Tyrosus of the Argent Dawn, and I welcome you all," continues the paladin. "The former Crusaders themselves have not made it this far yet, but they have proven invaluable in reinforcing our encampments at the Bulwark and Chillwind." He smiles, touching his eyepatch in a salute. "A regiment is currently headed eastward from the Bulwark to reinforce Light's Hope, but I fear your zeppelin has far outpaced them. We are expecting them in a few days. How urgent is your business in Stratholme?"

"My sson iss there. Hiss mother expectss him," Ezra answers calmly.

"I trust we can deal with any other problems you might want to asign to us later," adds Saeren.

The leader of the Argent Dawn nods grimly. "Family ties are one of the few strengths we have in our war on the Scourge," he says. "But I fear that, whatever your son may think, the Scarlet Crusade will see your mission... differently."

"Oh we aren't going to _ask_ for him," chuckles Ezra. "Ssaeren iss quite accomplished at the ssort of mission we have planned. If the Crusaderss are fortunate, they will ssurvive her vissit, yess."

Saeren laughs grimly, "At least a few of them, to tell the tale of warning to others."

Tyrosus shakes his head. "Though our brethren are misguided, they are stalwart foes of the Scourge. I pray you will allow as many to survive as possible. In any case, for now we can provide little more than a light infiltration party to assist you - though perhaps they can provide a distraction to allow you to enter the city relatively unhindered. As well, we can provide maps of the city and the cathedral."

"That iss the most valuable contribution you could make, yess," mutters Ezra. "I appreciate thiss. That you should be receiving ssurvivors of the Monastery should tell you of our intentionss, desspite their.. attitudes toward the Undercity, yess."

Maxwell Tyrosus smiles. "We have no qualms about your intentions, Ezra Pyreborn. The Forsaken have been even better allies against the Scourge than the Crusade; your people's hatred for your former slavemasters is no less strong, and at least you do not attack _us_. I merely hope that someday our wayward brethren will find their way back into the true wisdom of the Light." He gestures. "Come then. We must discuss our plans."

Knowing that the coming plans may well require moving as quietly as a shadow, Saeren seeks help. To move in silence also requires quiet, close killing. To manage this, the night elf needs an expert. With few to turn to and a city full of those who still would rather kill her than aid her, she does the only logical thing, she sends a message to the Dark Lady, outlining her intentions, and the desire to get a weapon suitable for her task.

Sylvanas is more than happy to assist the allies of Ezra Pyreborn, and Saeren soon finds herself in the Rogues' Quarter of the Undercity, bearing a steel token to serve as a recommendation to the Lady's private corps of infiltrators, the Death's Shadows.

The Rogues' Quarter is no place for the living. The Forsaken are, by their very nature, a sinister and untrustworthy race, and these qualities are magnified tenfold in this Quarter. And yet, Saeren almost feels at home here; the denizens of the Rogues' Quarter give her a wide berth, perhaps recognizing her as one of their own - or perhaps merely sensing instictively that the night elf is not to be trifled with.

The night elf moves easily through the Undercity, and it is only when she reaches this place that she reflects all the horrors she has walked past, unhindered, to come here. For her, there is a moment of surprise, and then comfort. Because of Ezra, she is able to see the Forsaken as people.

Saeren looks down at the token she was given. "Not much farther," she whispers to herself. "Soon I will know what I need to know."

Some looking finds the place Saeren was to find. It is not easy, but for her eyes, there are signs to reveal the entrance. If these people are the Dark Lady's, the night elf knows they will be extremely skilled. "It's time to learn how to Forsaken master the shadows."

Out of the corner of her eye, Saeren sees movement. Whirling around instinctively, she finds herself confronted by a leather-clad Forsaken with a strange, three-tined weapon halfway to her throat. He smiles and sheathes the weapon. "You must be Saeren," he says. "I am Gregory Charles. We were told to expect you."

Saeren raises her neck instinctively, then laughs. "A pleasure to meet you, Mister Charles. You must be the one I was sent for." She makes a mental note to ask about countering the moves she will be learning. The last thing she wants is something to get the jump on her.

"Call me Gregory," he says, gesturing. "You have good instincts, night elf. They need merely be honed and practiced. And there are few places in Azeroth where you can find a better place to do that, if I do say so myself."

"I don't doubt that, Gregory," says Saeren. "I will need those skills. I'm going to be making a little call on some of your friends to the east. I hope to leave a lasting impression and waves of paranoia in my wake."

"Ah, but which ones?" Gregory says. "We have so _many_ interesting friends that might deserve such a gift as you propose to offer." Once inside, he draws the weapon again. "This little beauty, for example, is probably best suited to our _living_ friends. It regrettably does little damage to unliving tissue, but it can be truly crippling against a living target."

"These are living targets," says Saeren. "For the moment, anyway. The kind that doesn't know Scourge from Forsaken and isn't interested in curing it's blindness with learning."

The Forsaken rogue cackles. "Well, _those_ benighted souls favor the sword. Should one of them overcome their blindness long enough to find _you_ skulking where they think you do not belong..." He hands the sai, hilt-first to Saeren, and draws a short sword. "This is the sort of weapon they favor. You will find that the sai is most effective at depriving them of it. Would you care to try?"

---

The time with Gregory is not the harsh and austere training of the Sentinels. It's more brutal and to the point, lightened only with the Forsaken's trainer's colorful personality and unique sense of humor. For all that, he is deadly serious, and he pushes Saeren harder every day.

The training focuses not just on learning the new weapon swiftly, but on gaining familiarity with a wide array of tools all designed to kill quietly and easily. Some of these are recognizable, some are totally alien, like a chain with a weight on one end and a wicked hook on the other. In the dark, time has little meaning for Saeren, but even so, she knows the training is long, and her friends see her only for moments at night or in the early morning.

Weapons alone cannot defeat the defenses of Stratholme. Saeren must learn to move in silence, stepping so lightly that she leaves no trace at all. This training is the most challenging of all. Gregory pushes harder, and the scope of the training grows ever greater. The final day of training is a hunt. The Forsaken leaves a note for Saeren that reads simply, "Evade me until nightfall. Then you will be ready."

For a full day Saeren moves through the Undercity like a shadow, using her every skill to keep Gregory off her trail. It is no small feat. Time after time, when it seems no one could find her, that no trace existed, he comes into view, forcing the Night Elf to move on, to push her skills to their very limit.

When the very last moments of the test come Gregory appears out of the shadows. Just in time Saeren is able to deflect his attack, using the Sai to twist his sword from his hands and in the next breath bringing its tip to his heart. The Forsaken claps his hands together in clap of approval, "Yes! To our dear friends a shadow of a guest you shall be. Give them my highest regards."
