# Turning Tides 2010-08-16

Saeren drifts over the smoky ruins of Stratholme toward one of the few intact buildings in the city - the Scarlet Bastion, formerly a cathedral of the Silver Hand, and now converted into the Scarlet Crusade's fortress in the Scourge-dominated city. Far below, she can see the barricades in Crusader's Square, manned by crusaders who even now are battling off a wave of zombies.

Ahead, the angled roofs and spires of the Bastion await. A handful of crusaders can be seen lurking in the shadows, right where Saeren's map showed that the roof entrances would be.

There are four separate entrances on the roof - one at the bell tower, and three at other points around the building. According to the Argent Dawn maps, the bell tower staircase leads directly to the main chapel. Each entrance has two guards posted, both armed with crossbows; flying closer to one pair, Saeren can see the bells carried by their belts.

Saeren studies the situation and quickly comes to a conclusion. The world is going to have to do with a few less psychotic zealots that won't listen to reason. Fortunately, where reason fails, Diplomacy prevails. Two arrows nearly take the head off of the first crusader. Saeren rushes in, making sure his fall makes no noise. A quick survey of the area is done as she hunts for the ideal place to leave the body.

Two more arrows and another dead body. Saeren calculates a good hiding space for these lost ones and makes her way inside. She hopes this path is as good a choice as it initially seems.

As Saeren descends the stair, she sees her hand become visible on the guardrail, and feels the stair slowly take up her weight. The limit of Ezra's ability to cover her entrance has been reached; she's on her own from here.

The staircase terminates in a small landing with a closed wooden door, which according to the map opens into the novitiates' hallway. There is no question of day shift or night shift; the Bastion keeps a twenty-four hour watch, as the dead do not sleep. Saeren can only hope that she is not right in the middle of a shift change.

After taking the precaution of slipping on one of the disguise rings Ezra gave her, Saeren tries the guards' keys in the lock until she finds the one that opens it. She opens the door to an empty hallway, with doors lining the far wall about every three yards, each bearing a small piece of paper with a name written on it. The hall dead-ends about three doors down, and the other end leads to a T-junction.

The obvious move is to start the search. The night elf in disguise starts to look for the name of Andrew Lammas, going from paper to paper. With luck, she won't have to knock the answer out of someone--that's pretty hard to keep quiet, after all.

As Saeren approaches the main hallway, she finds the name 'Lammas' in careful printed letters over the door - and at the same time, she hears footsteps echoing down the corridor.

With the door here and apparently unlocked, Saeren does the logical thing: she barges right in. If the boy is here, he's got a guest. A generic Scarlet Crusader has come to visit!

It just so happens that someone is sitting on the bed as Saeren enters; having met both the parents, the family resemblance is unmistakable. "Who are you?" he asks, his eyes narrowed. "And what are you doing in my room?"

Saeren looks over the young man appraisingly. "My name is not important, but since you asked, I am Saeren. I don't have much time to talk." She pulls the disguise ring off. "Your parents sent me, and if you want to get out of here comfortably, you will keep your voice down."

The young man's eyes widen and his hand flies reflexively to a sword hilt as the Crusader suddenly turns into a night elf. "My father is dead, stranger. And my mother sent me here. Explain yourself, and quickly, before I raise the alarm."

Saeren nods, "Everything you say is true. And yet, he lives." She slips on the ring of disguise once more, this time to show Ezra's appearance. "And he wishes to see you once more. He is free. Your mother has changed her mind, at least somewhat, in light of this revelation."

"You are right to believe that the Forsaken are free, Mr. Lammas," says Saeren. "Do you think a night elf would so freely make friends of them?"

The hand slips away from the sword. "My father... is of the Forsaken?" The younger Lammas gapes at Saeren. Then his mouth snaps shut. "Then he must see what I have discovered," he says, opening his closet and fishing a bag out of the bottom drawer. "Do you know how we will get out of here? There will be questions asked if we go by the front gate - I am not scheduled to patrol the main gate today, and you appear on no schedule, not even in your Crusader guise."

"I will get you out of here," says Saeren. "Preferably with as little blood spilled as possible. There has been enough of it drained already on account of the truth." The night elf returns to the ring of the crusader. "Can you climb well? I think forcing the front gate would be a most messy affair."

Andrew grimaces. "You mean leaving via the roof? I'm not certain. It's a very long jump from the Bastion's roof to the nearest building. Perhaps your kind may be able to walk on air, but we humans are not quite so light-footed."

"What other ways do you know of, other than the front gate? And what might excuse you to go outside?" asks Saeren.

"I am scheduled to be on patrol at the southern rampart in four hours," Andrew says. "But how did you get in?"

"Through the roof. I don't dare wait four hours," says Saeren. "I'm afraid my entry was not without fighting. I doubt it will go unnoticed for long."

Andrew becomes more agitated. "The roof? Which stair? The stair just down the hall changes shift in..." He glances at an hourglass on the desk. "Ten minutes. If the guards there are missed, the whole Bastion will be on alert. There's no choice - we must go that way." He picks up another book on the desk, flipping through the pages and muttering under his breath. "And if I'm lucky, I might be able to get across the gap. Can you make the jump to the next rooftop?"

"Yes, I can," answers Saeren. "Let's move swiftly. But there is one rule. If I tell you to run, you go and do not look back. I can handle myself and this is all for nothing if you do not escape."

"Understood," Andrew says, putting the satchel over his shoulder and holding the other book in one hand. Some of the syllables he is muttering seem familiar; Saeren recognizes them from Ezra's spellcasting. "Lead the way."

Saeren pushes the door open carefully, her movements growing more and more silent. If she must kill, it will be done quietly. Of course, her charge is likely so loud she could hear him from ten yards, but his is the noise that is expected in the Bastion.

As the two reach the roof, Andrew pauses. The two who formerly guarded this trapdoor are no longer visible, but the young Crusader knows who they were. "Jim and Thomas were on patrol here. May the Light go with them." He closes his eyes for a brief moment, then opens them. "And may the Light be with me..."

He intones a few harsh, guttural syllables, and sweat breaks out on his brow as his feet slowly leave the ground. "Lead on - and quickly," he hisses.

Saeren leaps and rolls into a ready position. She can hear the bolt skitter across the roof and knows the inevitable has happened. She is already fitting her reply to string and zooming in on her target.

Saeren's arrows zip through the air and she whispers to Andrew, "Move and hide, quickly!" Waiting just a moment, she bellows out, "SCOURGE IN THE BASTION! SCOURGE IN THE BASTION!" She steps into the shadows of a crumbled chimney, wrapping herself up in darkness and vanishing.

Saeren sees a brief glimpse of fresh movement near the top of the bell tower, then it disappears again. Moments later, the sound of a bell peals out over the rooftop. The cry of "Scourge in the Bastion!" is taken up, and she hears it being repeated by the other roof guards. Unnoticed, Andrew flies unsteadily across the gap, and lands on the other side, looking in all directions. "Saeren? Which way did you go?" he hisses, as he takes cover right next to Saeren without showing any signs of noticing her.

"I'm here. Let's move, Andrew." She leads the way swiftly, watching as carefully as she can while moving swiftly. "We've got a little break now, but we're hardly out of here just yet."

Andrew startles at the voice coming from right in front of him, but follows in her wake. As she anticipated, his footsteps echo across the rooftops in a way that hers do not - but thanks to the diversion Saeren planted, there is no one to follow.

_Report, Saeren,_ comes Ezra's telepathic voice. But with the speed and clarity of this form of mental communication also comes everything else: his irritation with the Crusade, his fear of a zombie overrun, his concern for a boy he doesn't know.

Saeren's inward amusement at the confusion of the enemy is returned, but she, too, is concerned about getting this young man to safety. _He's out, they are in confusion. They believe they are invaded with Scourge. We're moving as fast as we can._

_Good work,_ answers Ezra after a moment. _We'll prepare to leave._

When Saeren begins to think to herself that she should have heard them by now is when the first eruption of heavy fire rings out. "Vickers," whispers Saeren quietly. "Come!" She knows enough to change her approach. It's best not to be anywhere near the line of fire. Closer the crackle of lightning rings out, and the sound of bits of gargoyle raining down on the stone below. The roar of Eecee's engines serves as background music to the battle, and long before Saeren comes into view, the fire blasts of her arrows can be seen, destroying zombies with laser precision.

At last, the enemies all silence, Saeren takes off her ring and steps forward. She reaches back to pull Andrew along. The boy's feet work fine, but perhaps now that it comes to it his mind isn't quite ready for the vision that stands before him. "We should hurry," says Saeren.

As Andrew alights on the mobile earth barricade, he stares at Ezra in shock; the illusion of Ezra's living form was poor preparation for the bandaged apparition before him. "Father?" Andrew asks unsteadily.

"Not... exactly, no," hums Ezra. "It iss true that I wass once Timothy Lammass, yess.. But the memoriess of that man are losst to me, ever ssince my return from the grave. It iss better if you think of me as... acting on your father'ss behalf, yess."

The young man nods, and swallows, visibly steeling himself. "Who in the Undercity would have an initial of V?" he asks. "It would be someone prominent."

The undead wizard thinks. "Many ssuch might have thiss name. Of coursse our mosst ahh, prominent citizen, Varimathrass, iss now dead. A dreadlord, the untrusstworthy associate of our Dark Lady. But there are otherss, certainly."

Andrew looks even more grim. "The Grand Crusader, Saidan Dathrohan, has been in secret correspondence with someone signing himself V," he says, hefting the satchel he carries. "If that is - was - a dreadlord, then matters are worse than I thought. And if he is dead, that would explain why the last letter from Undercity was two weeks ago. Let us get out of this cursed city, and we will discuss this further."
