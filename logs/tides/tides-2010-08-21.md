# Turning Tides 2010-08-21

The matter of the correspondence seems too urgent for Ezra to wait long. As the group sneaks back to their airship, he questions Andrew about the contents: "Anything relevant to the Sscarlet Crusade could be urgent at thiss time, yess. At leasst ssummarize your findingss for me, eh?"

Andrew looks grim. "Saidan Dathrohan has been playing the entire Scarlet Crusade for patsies. And the Forsaken were supposed to have been tools in this plan - a bogeyman to keep the Crusade in line."

"Explain yoursself," Ezra says, now sounding more concerned than ever. "Does thiss mention Daniel Batess, or Ssylvanas Windrunner?"

The younger Lammas opens his satchel, leafing through the contents. "Sylvanas was certainly mentioned - she was supposed to have been overthrown by now. And... yes, here it is. Daniel Bates was a 'useful fool' who supposedly has helped find new tools for their larger plans."

"Ah yeah, that'll be him," murmurs Ezra. "Go on?"

"Apparently, they planned to allow the defeat of the Scarlet Monastery," says Andrew. "There's some argument between Dathrohan and this V, but eventually V persuaded him to go along with it." His expression darkens further. "One of the inducements was that the invasion of the Monastery would yield some 'useful casualties' that would encourage the doubters amongst the Crusade. Mother was to have been one of them."

The undead wizard considers this in silence. "I should kill him with my own handss," he mutters, though it's not at all clear which 'him' he has in mind. Perhaps several.

"Save some for me," Andrew remarks. "Though if word of this gets out, I think we'll have a lot of help." He shakes his head. "I don't know what I would've been able to do if Saeren hadn't come for me."

"How did you come across thiss, anyway?" asks Ezra after a moment. "Thiss could be another trap, now that I give it ssome thought, yess."

"I'd been watching Archivist Galford's office," says Andrew. "Intelligence efforts are coordinated there. One of his assistants is sometimes... lax about securing the intelligence reports."

Ezra smiles. "And you are the ssort to make off with ssuch materials, eh?"

"I wouldn't have been," admits Andrew. "But something about Dathrohan set me on edge from the moment I met him. He just seems a little _too_ polished, sometimes."

Ezra rubs his bandaged hands together. "Yes, well, ah, I can't quite fault you for sstealing paperwork in the name of the greater good, can I," he mumbles shamefacedly. "You did well. But if your mother wass to be killed, well.... thiss I cannot countenance." He faces the young man, glowing eyes staring through bandages. "Your mother could not sstand to ssee me like thiss. You sseem more capable of it, yess."

Andrew shakes his head. "To be honest, Father, I was pretty young when you died. I suppose I don't remember you as clearly as she did. And I've seen plenty of undead in my time. You're not the most gruesome, by far." He coughs. "At least with your bandages on."

This interests Ezra. "Well then," he says. "Let me sshare a ssecret with you, young man. Or rather.. ssomething which has no business sstaying a secret. And then I musst ask you a question, one which I neglected to assk your mother. I was....foolish, and afraid, I think."

The wizard's body transmutes itself into sand once again, as he has done before, as he will do again. And as before, it coalesces into a living human being. Ezra carefully removes his bandages. "This is the face of your father, Andrew Lammas."

Andrew's eyes widen. "There were rumors going around but... that's incredible," he says, in wonder and astonishment.

Ezra pockets the bandages he wore about his face. "It gives the Forsaken hope to know that this is possible," he says with a smile. "It came about because of a piece of wisdom I remembered. One of the few memories I have. It was something said by who I want to think was Alexstrasza - the Life-Binder, Queen of the Red Dragons herself. Someone who works tirelessly to preserve and sustain life on Azeroth. This fate is what I've chosen for myself as well."

"What I remember was knowing that she'd said this: Both sunlight and fire are necessary for the forest to endure. The forest is this world. The lesson is that forest fires, burning away dead wood, are just as important as the sun's nourishment of the trees. Creation and destruction are opposites, but both are necessary in the larger scheme of things."

Andrew thinks about this. "That's... an interesting point of view. I can't say I've heard it before."

Ezra smiles. "It is foreign to the Forsaken, who have known nothing but loss. But what bothers me now is this." He rubs his hands together, still bandaged, but flesh nonetheless; he feels the warmth of the motion. "Why do I remember something that the queen of the Red Dragonflight said? I thought I didn't care, but meeting your mother again, meeting you, well.. it seems that to be true to myself I _must_ care. And so it follows that I must _know_. The question I was afraid to ask her is this: Who was Timothy Lammas? Is this a false memory, or would he - I - have a reason to have heard this wisdom?"

Andrew ponders this for a while. Then he speaks. "I don't remember much about you. But I do know that you were a mage of the Kirin Tor, because I was also taught magic - it was hoped that I would follow in your footsteps." He smiles sheepishly. "To be honest, I don't think I really have the knack. Even a simple flight spell is draining."

"Now I don't know if the Kirin Tor would have much to do with the red dragons," Andrew says. "But... it's possible."

"Ahh. Rhonin." Ezra laughs. "The Second War. I wonder if that was it. Well.... I shall have to ask your mother for details, then." He calms down a bit. "My comrade Kagarn once asked me about what I would do if I remembered my past. I told him that I'd be another man, and that he ought to ask that man the same question. Daniel Bates - that 'useful fool' you read about - thought I would be ready to work with him. To work with the naga, to destroy the Scarlet Monastery and overthrow Undercity. You see, Andrew, what I am most afraid of in this world now is the possibility of becoming such a man. So .. memories are really what I'm afraid of."

"V was apparently... _amused_ by Daniel Bates," Andrew says. "Daniel seemed to think he could control or contain V. So perhaps you needn't fear his judgment as much as you think."

Ezra shrugs and smiles. "I'd just rather not.. take the chance. I think I know what's right for now, and I need to see it through. But, this also means that your father is dead. I'm sorry." He extends a bandaged hand. "My name is Ezra. I'm pleased to meet you."

Andrew takes the bandaged hand and shakes it firmly. "Pleased to meet you, Ezra. And I think... yes, I think my father would've been pleased to meet you as well."
