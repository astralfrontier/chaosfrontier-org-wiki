# Turning Tides 2010-09-29

Five figures approach the shimmering violet barrier behind which sits the city of Dalaran. Four of them are bedecked in the gallantry of the Argent Dawn: the eight-pointed silver sun of their tabards, the steel and silk and gold of their ceremonial armor, the fluttering pennant held proudly aloft by one upon which the same device is emblazoned.

The fifth is more simply attired. Black coat and hat, white bandages, and a crystal-infused cane of wood clenched in one hand. As the group comes to a stop outside the shield, he raises his head and shields his glowing eyes with his free hand. The light from the shield is bright indeed.

The leader of the armored knights steps forward from his comrades. "Wizards of Dalaran!" he calls loudly. "We seek an audience! Permit a representative to come forth that we may speak!"

Seconds pass. The knights look to each other and to the black-clad figure. A minute passes. A ripple of magical energy appears at long last, and out of emptiness steps the agent of Dalaran. She wears robes of many colors and her face is veiled by cloth which bears the sigil of Dalaran, but her pointed ears reveal her as a high elf.

"Knights of the Argent Dawn," the elf lilts, bowing to each in turn. She has a pleasant enough voice, but there is little kindness or welcome to it. "There is no value in bringing prisoners of war to us; we have no use for his kind." She gestures with a gloved hand at the black-and-white creature lurking within the crusaders' ranks.

The lead knight speaks. "Ma'am, he's not of the Scourge. He's Forsaken, those free-willed--" He's cut off as the elf lifts her hand. "I know this. Think you that we are not also at war with them?"

The crusaders of the Dawn murmur amongst themselves. Their leader continues. "Nevertheless he is not a prisoner. He recommended that we come to ask a favor of you, and he intends to come with us." Sensing neither that the interview is at an end nor a softening of the elf-mage's demeanor, he continues. "I am Bryan Chesterton. With me is Barlowe Grace, Lady Sarah Silverton, and Gregor the Just." He raises his mailed hand to the man in black. "And this is Ezra L. Pyreborn."

The elf listens calmly, head turning to seek each member of the company as he or she is named in turn. "All but the Forsaken are welcome in this city," she announces. "For a time. But you presume much, Bryan Chesterton. For what reason would you bring such a creature here?"

The knight begins to formulate an answer. But before he does, Ezra speaks up. "Peace," he croaks. "You want peace."

The elf stops; her foot slides behind her in the dust, before she restrains the urge to retreat entirely. "Explain yourself, creature of darkness," she commands hotly. "By what right does that word escape your lips?"

"I know of your hate," says Ezra in a sighing singsong. "The high elves decimated, yess. Prince Arthass and hiss desstruction of Ssilvermoon City. I ssaw the Dead Sscar with my own eyes. Ssuch waste. Ssuch loss. Your heart is heavy. As is that of the other elvess who make up thiss city. And the human wizards? The emergence of that lich, Kel-Thuzad? Yess. I know thiss story."

The elf-mage draws her hands together. She is not casting a spell, not yet. But she is not at peace. "Who are you to mock us so?" she asks. The heat in her voice is still controlled.

Ezra laughs. It is no wholesome noise. "Who am I? I am he that resurrected the son of Fandral Sstaghelm. I am he that sspeaks to Titans and dragonss. By _my_ hand were the Forssaken unified. By _my_ hand was the Sscarlet Crusade sspared. By _my_ will did they ride alive to join their Argent cousins. I have the ear of the high priestess of the night elves and the warchief of the Horde. I counsel unity and cooperation, and the Dark Lady of the Undercity hearss the wisdom of my words." The undead wizard rises up, gripping his cane as he hobbles forward. "I am the architect of peace in Lordaeron. You would do well to lissten, yess."

The elf's hands have slumped to her sides. She makes a muffled choking noise, and wobbles for just a moment. "If you will wait here," she says at last, "I will see who may speak with you." And she vanishes just as quickly as she came.

The Argent ambassadors have started a small campfire with the coming of dusk. An hour has passed since their last interview. Now at the edges of their fire, a brief ripple of magical force signals the arrival of another mage.

This one is human, and wears robes and a veil of more intricate work than the elf-maid - presumably he is of higher stature. "I am here to listen to your petition, men and women of the Argent Dawn. And.. to this Forsaken you have brought to our doorstep."

Chesterton speaks up. "We propose to travel to Kalimdor. Our need is great, and our Forsaken companion thinks that you would be able to transport us directly there. He says he has business with Dalaran anyway."

The newcomer mage quirks a brow behind his veil. "Your business, Ezra Pyreborn?"

In response Ezra withdraws a sealed letter and presents it. "The Old God Dagun has awakened, ssir," he explains. "You will find additional detailss within. For now, my mission is to ssee that the free peopless of the world are unified againsst this threat."

"You will understand if I find it ... ironic that a member of your kind should be a messenger of peace, Ezra," the mage responds.

This only brings an unearthly chuckle. "I sstand with my alliess againsst this menace. I claim the right of a former sslave, fighting to end all ssimilar forms of sservitude. The naga ssteal away the wills of those they assault, sir."

The mage nods briefly. "I see." He slips the letter into his robes. "You have it on my word that the Council of Six will receive this information fully, and that any reply due to the Undercity will be delivered by messenger." He rubs his hands together. "As for transportation to Kalimdor.. well, given the unusual circumstances of our meeting, I must assume the Argent Dawn would not ask such a thing frivolously. A circle of mages will gather here in the morning to see you on your way."

Chesterton bows his head in gratitude. The others join in. And Ezra tips his hat politely.
