# Turning Tides 2010-10-24

With the dwarven war machine temporarily halted, Sookie and Nerai rendezvous with the Southshore militia on its march toward the coastline. According to the plan devised back at Southshore, the army will hug the mountains as soon as they are well clear of the Dun Garok entrance; the sea belongs to the naga, and the longer they can delay being seen from there, the better.

As the human forces, with their adventuring allies, round an outcrop, the sea becomes visible. Off the coast is a horde of swimming figures - mostly murlocs, with a few armored naga males directing them.

Further into the ocean are a series of stone pillars, formed by the pounding surf as it erodes the limestone at the base of the cliff. "There," says one of the dwarven engineers to Nerai, pointing at the largest stone pillar. "Plant yer charges there, on the landward face o' that pillar, and ye'll bring tha whole thing down on the mountainside."

The defenders of Azeroth charge from the forest; the murloc army moves to intercept them. "We'll hold off the rabble!" calls the Southshore commander. "You blow the tunnel! May the Light be with you!" And as the armies move, the adventurers catch sight of the tunnel's last line of defense: a small but potent force of naga, the males in highly decorated and polished coral armor, and the females ornately dressed in the livery of Azshara's priesthood. In the center of the formation is a particularly imperious four-armed naga woman, who Saeren recognizes as the commander of the Southshore raid.

Saeren forces her concentration into the first shot of the fight, but luck is not with her. Though confident her aim was on, she finds her shots have missed the mark twice in a row. "This is going to be interesting," the Night Elf mutters.

As soon as Saeren opens fire, the naga immediately submerge. However, Saeren's eyes can discern the telltale ripples - the entire group is swimming toward them, and she can see more ripples coming around the edge of the pillar.

"Vickers! Hold Position and Aim and Fire at the Naga. Largest ones first." Nerai belts out a command in her most authoritative voice, as she guides Eecee into the water. She watches the various oiled-leather seals as she starts to march the mech into the water. A few turbines on Eecee take effect as the water covers over Eecee's frame, the crystal done covering Nerai's cockpit in a with a ziip noise.

Sookie steps to one side, slowly moving toward one of the nearby boulders as she stares intently at the water.

Vickers' chainguns begin to spin up. Its monotone voice rings out: "No naga presently visible. Preparing to fire."

As Saeren watches intently for a target, the swarm of ripples continue to flow toward the party - except for one, which appears to be holding in place and thrashing.

The captured myrmidon is yanked bodily out of the water, surrounded by arcing lightning and the winds of a storm. "This how I fight, goshi!" shouts Sookie over her shoulder at the night elf.

As the naga is flung into the air, Vickers intones, "Target acquired." The chainguns begin tracking the hapless myrmidon as they spin up to full speed.

Nerai sees the Naga's strategy, adn also the one floating up into the air. "Ah, so that's the game." Nerai parks Eecee in the water about here, until the enemies manage to make it here.

Saeren, on the other hand, is already prepared to fire. An arrow flashes across the surface of the water and plunges deep into the naga's armor. Already distressed, the naga bellows in pain and rage.

The naga continue to converge on the party, except for the two being held by Sookie. The one in the air abandons any attempt to escape the half-elemental's grasp, and pulls a harpoon from behind his back.

Sookie drags up another myrmidon from the depths and slams her already captured target hard against the nearby rocky cliffs of Dun Garok's mountain home, grinning like a maniac all the while.

As the Naga splatters against the wall, Vickers opens fire with it's cannon, 10 rounds of hot lead fly through the air and slam the already abused corpse of the Naga, leaving lead and blood against the rocks.

Nerai holds position in the water, watching the Naga approach.

Saeren rather enjoys having the enemy pinned in the air like this. "Sookie, you are a godsend," the archer says with a grin. The shots are true, but the enemy clings to life, making the adjustment to wearing two arrows in the face.

Undaunted by the demise, or near-demise, of two of their comrades, the remainder of the naga strike force continues to make its way toward the beach. All but three of them, which seem to be holding position.

As the two battered naga plummet unexpectedly back into the sea, Sookie steps closer to the protective cover of a nearby boulder and goes fishing again.

Three of the naga suddenly emerge from the water and fling bolts of freezing water in Sookie's direction. Two of them sail past uselessly, and the third smacks into the boulder she was using as cover - the stone crackles as its surface temperature rapidly drops, but is otherwise unaffected.

One of the naga witches goes flying through the air, as Sookie peeks round the corner of her new friend the protective boulder. She scowls at the far end of the ocean from which the magical bolts came and mutters something in Kalimag.

Nerai watches the ice sail overhead, and lifts Eecee's shield up beside her, looking out from around it at the approaching army. Eecee's hands clutch around the sword he has drawn.

Vickers picks up the tracking of the latest attendee of Sookie's flight school.

Saeren nods to Sookie as her arrows flit uselessly away from the target. The night elf frowns in thought, "Going to need to change tactics here somehow," she muses aloud.

"She protected, goshi," Sookie explains. "I fix."

Two more naga appear out of the water, gesturing. A thick fog suddenly coalesces around them, obscuring the surface of the water and everything behind.

"Fall back a bit, we need to draw them out of the water." She looks back at Sookie for just a moment, "More then a couple at a time, unfortunately." She starts to back pedal, and orders, "Vickers, fall back 5 yards and wait." turning back to look at the Naga.

The half-elemental girl is really using her powers, and it shows. Sparkly whiteness, like a cloud, is seeping out from around her bracers and over her hands. Her eyes are becoming empty glowing white orbs, and the effect spreads outward across from her face as well. Two of the naga females are flung against the hard rock of the cliff.

Saeren shouts ahead to Nerai, "I'm backing up, when they poke out of the water I'll be ready!" If her shot will have any effect is an entirely different question at this point.

The myrmidons emerge from the surf and storm up the beach, tridents at the ready, and the fog bank advances behind them.

Nerai looks at the advancing Naga, and smiles a little, "Vickers, Fire at the Naga you can see, two targets." She yells. Vickers responds immediately, a high pitched whine is heard, that usually comes before lead-filled death.

Vickers comes to life, the cannons roar, creating violent ripples of water around it's target, but only one round manages to find it's mark, tearing viscerally into the Naga.

With the Naga rising from the waters, Saeren has another chance to deal with her hated enemies. This time, both shots ring true, and the first explodes, searing some of the Naga with bits of burning wood and steel, while others only notice the fires bouncing off their armor.

The myrmidons have finally reached the shore and begin to swarm around those nearby, some of them targeting Eecee and others pursuing the woman behind the boulder. The fog bank progresses up the waves, and chanting in Nazja can be heard from within it.

As the half-elemental girl lifts off and darts backward from the safety of cover, she lets loose with a spectacular lightning bolt against the myrmidon who came so close to attacking her. Her entire face and arms are now white and sparking with repressed electrical energy, and she lands just beyond Saeren and Shade.

"Vickers, Fire at that one!" Nerai points at the one that was, until just now, attacking Sookie. Nerai turns and engages, swinging her sword at the one who's taken the full brunt of the attack.

The lead rips through Sookie's stalker, turning him into a fine red mist. Nerai cleaves into the bloody Naga who's attacking her, slicing deep into his side, but he remains standing, his wounds still seeping blood.

Saeren draws and fires two times, to the unfortunately common effect in this battle. Two more misses, only this time she wasn't on the mark to begin with. The night elf doesn't react, but already is reaching for another set of bolts and doing a bit of calculation in her mind.

Deprived of any other convenient targets, the heavily armored naga soldiers surround Eecee, fencing Nerai in with their long tridents. Swerving and dodging, Nerai is able to avoid most of the assault, but one ice-tipped spear manages to penetrate Eecee's thick hull.

Sidestepping Saeren to get a clear shot, Sookie reaches out with a lightning-laced hand and makes a gripping motion. One of the myrmidons surrounding Eecee is seized by the invisible force she wields, then charred to a deep black by a surge of electricity which arcs from the girl's other hand.

Nerai yells instructions at Vickers, pointing urgently at the one closest to the cannon. Nerai takes a step against some of the other Naga, swinging her sword at one. Nerai's sword connects true, and smashes into the Naga's shoulder, but the blow is fully absorbed by the Naga's tough skin. Vickers beeps, the engine of death continuing to fire, filling another Naga with lead, leaving little in the way of remains.

Saeren narrows her eyes, firing twice. This time, there are no mistakes, no errors, and no magical shields, just soft, pliable flesh to catch her shots. The naga tumble to the ground, lifeless. "That's better," she sighs, relieved to hit something effectively again.

With nearly half their number slaughtered, the remaining naga have had enough. "Retreat!" calls the voice from inside the cloud, and the surviving myrmidons turn tail and dive into the surf as fast as they can. The fog cloud remains where it is, and ripples appear in the water - though muted; apparently the naga are diving deep.

Nerai sees the Naga retreat and points, "Vickers, best shot." And the cannon again roars with a terrible noise, but the bullets spread out along the water, plopping into the water with a splash each.
