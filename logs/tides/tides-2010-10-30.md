# Turning Tides 2010-10-30

Dawn arrives, and with it a handful of mages from Dalaran. Ezra and the Argent Dawn's emissaries sit up from their bedrolls, extinguishing the last remnants of their campfire.

The mages' faces are veiled, and their robes are those the group saw yesterday. They wait patiently for the paladins to don their armor, and their leader speaks. "The Council of Six has been in discussion since last night. You five will be interviewed. Bryan Chesterton, you will speak for the Argent Dawn. Ezra Pyreborn, you will not speak unless questioned. Do this and we will grant the favor you ask. Is that clear?"

Chesterton bobs his head in agreement and slips on his helm. Taking hold of the paladins, the mages intone their teleportation spells.

The Violet Citadel is a thing of beauty. Ezra catches his breath - what he sees is a stark contrast to the barbaric crimson power of the Scarlet Monastery, or the bleak haunts of the Forsaken amid the blackened corpse that was once the city of Lordaeron. Only Silvermoon City, ruined as it was, still retained some of the delicate majesty he witnesses here.

"Strange," muses Ezra aloud. "What is?" asks Chesterton, and the wizard gestures about him. Pointed ears rise here and there from the small knots of citizens gathered to watch as the five are escorted through the streets and up the broad staircase to the Citadel. Ezra chuckles softly. "Thiss. I wass one of these people, once. Or so I am told, yess. But I find mysself .. amazed by what I ssee."

"The appreciation of beauty is a rare gift in these dark times," says Lady Silverton, one of the knights. "Treasure it, whatever its source."

The mages escorting the party peel away as the citadel's doors swing wide without visible intervention - more of the city's omnipresent magic at work. And inside the citadel, seated at a table shaped like a crescent moon, are six beings - the Council of Six, the leadership of Dalaran.

All are veiled and robed as the other mages, but these even more so. It is impossible to guess at their identity or gender, and as they speak in turn Ezra hears the magic which disguises their voices. Each is distinct, but none are identifiable.

"The Chamber of Air receives its guests," one intones. The walls and ceiling fade away, leaving nothing but a rapidly-changing open sky. "Ezra Pyreborn, we meet to discuss the allegations presented in your correspondence."

"Bryan Chesterton, of the Argent Dawn. This creature claims that the Scarlet Crusade was to be infected through a vessel crafted by the naga, and made into their slaves. And that further, this was only one small attack forming part of a worldwide threat. Will you affirm that this is so?"

Chesterton stands tall. "I will affirm it, and if I may speak further..?" The robed and veiled mages incline their heads in assent.

"Since the rise of the Lich King, the Argent Dawn and the Scarlet Crusade have both sought to stem the tide of the Scourge - those mindless undead enslaved by his will and sent to destroy the world. We have had our disagreements, but the clear threat of the Scourge could not be denied. Now we have seen with our own eyes signs that the naga seek a similar dominion over the living. At present the Lich King sleeps and the Scourge simply run rampant, but the naga _are_ active, and _are_ poised to make good their dire threat. I implore you to listen to this man."

The mages look to each other for a moment. Their leader continues in his magically altered voice. "It is not necessary that he explain further; his letter has spoken for him. What we require now is evidence - proof that what he says is true, proof that we can find by sending an emissary to Kalimdor with you. We do not doubt your word; we merely consider the possibility that you also could be .. misled."

Another mage speaks now. "We will send with you Krasus, one of our most trusted and capable deputies. We will take his report once he establishes certain things. Your own mission will continue unhindered. In addition we will give you a token whereby you can call Krasus' attention to your location, and he will arrange for your return to Lordaeron - if you wish it."

Bryan Chesterton bows low; his companions follow suit. "Your assistance in this matter is most appreciated, lords of Dalaran," he proclaims.

One of the Six makes a hand signal; invisible doors in the back of the chamber open, admitting ten elves armed for battle. They take a position against what must be the far wall, although Ezra cannot discern it himself. They must be able to pierce whatever illusion makes up this 'Chamber of Air'. Their leader presents herself with a stiff salute.

"May I present Vereesa Windrunner, Ranger-General of Dalaran," the mages' leader announces. "During the Third War, she and our deputy Rhonin were appointed as Alliance Ambassadors by King Terenas, acting together with the Kirin Tor - to remind the peoples of the world that other threats still faced the world."

Ezra turns and smiles through his bandages. "Then we are alike, yess."

Vereesa tenses. "We are not alike, Forsaken," she replies coldly. "We do not ally with the orcs and the ... the blood elves. You yourself were a threat to the living, and may still be. Yet you come here to ask ... what of us, exactly?"

Ezra is silent for many seconds. "You are free to speak," the mages' leader announces, though that is not what he has been waiting for.

"I sspeak not on behalf of the Undercity so much as one of itss denizens," Ezra says. "But that which I have ssaid has proven in the passt to be of benefit to we Forssaken, yes. It has convinced our Dark Lady, Sylvanas... Windrunner, yes." Vereesa's knuckles tighten as she grips her bow, but Ezra continues.

"And sso I come to you today with a requesst, yes. It iss this. No more fighting. No more hatred. I assk for peace. Thiss animosity iss a curse that hangs over all our headss, yes. Hatred amongst the elvess - kal'dorei and sin'dorei, sin'dorei and quel'dorei. Hatred of the living for the dead - and vice versa. Of orcs, and humanss. And sso on."

Ezra removes his hat and begins slowly unwinding his bandages, revealing his burned face inch by horrid inch. "The Highborne, now the naga, are curssed. Cursed of body, having been transsformed into their shapes by the will of Dagun. Curssed of mind, hating the ssurface, forgetting their pride as the workers of wonders - your exalted ancesstors, Ranger-General. We cannot allow oursselves to be cursed in the same way."

Ezra's voice gains in volume and power. "I am sure I wass told this. My memory iss gone, yess, but her words remain. Alexstrasza, the Life-Binder, commanded this: The foresst thrives on both sunlight and flame. Nourishment and destruction are both vital. Opposites musst join together in the sservice of something greater. And sso today, I have a message I bring to you, the message that I hope will convince you that peace is not only possible but necessary. That message is this:"

"There iss no curse that cannot be lifted!" And his body transforms itself, the fires of his soul igniting the Bronze Dragonflight's desert magic. When it is lifted, a human mage clad all in black stands before the Council of Six. "I have done it. Vereesa Windrunner, I will not be the lasst Forsaken to achieve this."

The Ranger-General, like so many before her, can only stare in shock for several seconds, as do many of the rangers in her command. Even the Council of Six, behind Ezra, can be heard to murmur amongst themselves _sotto voce_. Vereesa's hand on her bow begins to tremble. "This... is a trick..." she whispers.

One of the Council speaks. "An illusion? In the Chamber of Air itself? No, Vereesa, what you see is the truth, nothing more or less." Vereesa glares, white-faced, at the Councilman, but bows in acknowledgement.

Ezra is close to shouting. "My curse! I have transsmuted it into a blessing through divine alchemy! The demonic blood-curse of the orcss, broken through the heroic sacrifice of one of their greatesst leaders! Even the naga - even they - have been transsformed into something new, with the help of the _very Titans themselves_. They may be brought back. But not as they were, no. They are freed of their bonds to Dagun, but ssomething of their aquatic nature sstill lingers. Sso it is with me - I remain Forssaken, desspite my return to life. Sso it is with the orcss, in their own way. Sso it will be with all whose curse is broken. They will remain changed in ssome fashion."

"There iss thiss new thing happening. I want you to be a part of it. You have much to hate, and much to fear. I know. I know." Ezra lets out a sigh. "The night elves are still laboring under their curse. The blood elves too - yes, even they have a curse. It can be lifted. We can all be free. Conssider my words, and deliver your reply to the Undercity when you reach a decision. That iss all I have to say."

Vereesa's face is very white. "Does the Council have any orders for my rangers at this time?" she asks flatly. Ezra looks back at the crescent table. One of the mages has started to rise, but another has reached out to grip his_her wrist in a very firm hold. He_she sits down slowly. "No orders at this time. We will consult with you shortly for your evaluation on how to proceed."

"Very well." With that, the high elf wheels and turns, making a beeline for the doors.

Bryan Chesterton and his knights are gathered in the transferral room. Ezra joins them shortly.

"Any luck, Ezra?" Bryan asks. The wizard shakes his head. "Some sseem to remember the name Timothy Lammas, but I don't believe they will sspeak to me about this matter... for now."

A tall, confident-looking high elf, notably without his veil, steps into the transferral room as well. "My name is Krasus. I'll be accompanying you to the Exodar. Ezra, there's no need to gather a circle of mages - this room will provide enough magical energy for the ritual. I'll assist you in the ceremony, since you know where we're going."

The Forsaken wizard nods. "Well, then. Welcome aboard."
