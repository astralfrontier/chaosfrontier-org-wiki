# Turning Tides 2010-11-07

> (OOC) Log "Tides-2010-11-07" started by Sookie at Sun Nov 7 16:53:51 2010 CST (OOC)

The naga have begun their retreat. Tensely, three sets of eyes watch the ripples of the sea. But the naga aren't heading anywhere near the bomb site; their wakes suggest they are trying to dive deep.

Sookie launches herself into the air with intent to follow, propelled by her power. "Goshi," she shouts, "I murder more!"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Scary n.n"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "now's your chance to stop her if you dare n.n"

Saeren shouts out, "Sookie, wait! There is no need!" The night elf isn't about to let the elemental girl charge off into a trap. "Let the cowards flee. We will do what we need to do and deal with them later."

Nerai looks back at Saeren, calling across the field, "You should probably stop her. I'm not sure we can help if she runs." Nerai, for her own part, starts to guide the waterproof Eecee into the water, aiming for her bombing point. "Vickers, stay on the shore."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I dare n.n"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Maybe swap those?"

Sookie pauses in mid-air, then floats dejectedly back to the ground.

> (OOC) Sookie does so

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm not sure who can ^^;;"

Saeren nods to Sookie, knowing the expression on her face. "I know, the hunt is what we long for," says the night elf. "There will be battle again soon enough. It follows us like a shadow."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "We're always killing people n.n"

Looking about, Sookie taps her lip with one dirty finger. "Na, goshi," she says after a moment. "We can at least eat what's here, right?"

"Eat?" asks Saeren. "I can't say I've a taste for Naga, myself. Even for me, the kill was enough, and now there are greater victories. Are any of them alive?"

Sookie shrugs. "I go look. Still have to pay back dumb human." She lopes off in the direction of the fallen invaders. "Thinking nagahide boots."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "okay. Nerai, want to pose setting the bomb up and its effects?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Mike sez 1 Siren, a couple of myrms. if anyone has First Aid and/or default, roll to stabilize"

> (OOC) Saeren checks skillz quick

> (OOC) Nerai works on bomb pose.

> (OOC) Saeren has a really shitty first aid score. Can I take 20? :D

> (OOC) Sookie says, "First Aid default is IQ-4 if you don't have it"

> (OOC) Saeren has 13.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "goferitthen"

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d6 for 14 (5 6 3)

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Dammit. Do I get another attempt? o.O"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "there's like 2 others to go"

> (OOC) Saeren also has fishing, if that helps. Hahaha

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d6 for 9 (5 1 3)

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d6 for 11 (1 4 6)

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Two out of three ain't bad~~~"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Mike: 1 surviving witch, 1 myrm."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "we can restrain them and it'll take a Southshore healer or Kagarn to patch em back up"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "It turns out I'm way better at killing them then saving them."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "they will be unconscious for a few hours at best"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So basically I pose sookie dragging them to me and me doing some duct tape healing."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "goferit"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "while you guys are posing, w're gonna head back home"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "You guys go to afk?"

Saeren waits for Sookie to draw in the Naga who have some hope of surviving. The night elf, for all her hatreds, works frantically to try and keep them from dying. She curses angrily under her breath as she works, finally sitting back with a sigh. "Damn! If only I had more skill..." She calls out to Nerai, "We have two prisoners to bring back."

> (OOC) Saeren was posing :)

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Er, not what I meant, saeren... apperantly there's a new online-themed hangout in their area called the afk lounge."

Nerai makes her way to the point indicated by the dwarves last night. She carefully rigs up the bomb, pulling several parts out of the Eecee's trunk as she carefully shapes the charges, hooks the various igniters together. Normally, in the wild, if you see a goblin setting a bomb, something between glee and ecstasy is traipsed across their face. But not in this case, as Nerai, reminded of the gravity of her task, has a grave, concerned look on her face. Finally, she is done, satisfied with the results, she sheds a singly tear for the dwarves, and starts back for the shore, detonator in her hand.

"Is everything alright, Nerai?" asks the Night Elf. Usually the goblin looks so happy just before blowing things up.

> (OOC) Nerai is answering and blowing up at the same time so....

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Take your time ^^"

Nerai nods her head, "Just something someone said last night.." She smiles a bit. She turns around, and presses the button.. In the distance, the rocks explode, causing the minimal amount of landslide possible, collapsing the rocks across the wide inlet used to bring salt water from the sea into the cave. The rocks slide, and cascade, in a loud rumble following the large blast of the charges. When the rocks are done sliding, the entrance is through blocked. She turns back, and nods at Saeren, "Oh, Prisoners?"

Saeren watches the explosion with an appreciative eye. She enjoys the noise everytime it happens. Returning to the matter of prisoners she frowns. "Yes. Two, when there should have been three. My skill wasn't up to the task."

"It seems like everyone is losing family today..." Nerai says, cryptically, then shrugs, "We'll take the others back with us."

> (OOC) TidesGM has connected.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "no afk tavern today, that's like 45 minutes away. just went to Denny's"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Oh."

> (OOC) TidesGM takes over the reins for a bit, unless you guys have more.

> (OOC) Nerai is done unless things need reacting.

> (OOC) Saeren is good

With the explosion, and the retreat of their leadership corps, the remaining members of the murloc army retreat back into the sea alongside their naga sergeants and commanders. Casualties were mercifully light on both sides, largely because the battle was so brief, but the handful of neophyte priests in the Southshore militia have their hands full with the human survivors.

"Dumb dead humans," Sookie mutters to herself. "Dumb dead naga.."

> (OOC) Saeren sweatdrops at Sookie.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "yeeeees?"

"Dumb?" asks Saeren, rather puzzled by the word in this case.

Sookie is watching the triage of the survivors from a safe distance. She doesn't turn to look at Saeren, preferring perhaps the bloody spectacle beyond. "If they smart, they stay in own cave and hunt," she replies. "But humans always dumb. They go and fight things. I hear them say things like 'honor' and 'victory' and 'bravery'. Dumb, dumb, dumb."

"Sometimes an enemy won't let you be in your own cave, Sookie. Sometimes, they come and kill you," explains Saeren. "And sometimes, there are things more important than life."

"Naga were going to let me swim down to ruins, underwater ruins, after world was killed," Sookie mutters. "With Rune of Unending Breath. I could play down there for rest of life. No more dumb yeti, no more dumb humans.." She raises a hand, wiping something from her eye. "Naga enemy now. All dumb."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Huh. War. What is it good for?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Yeah >.>"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone going to comment on that line Sookie just dropped?"

Saeren isn't really sure what to make of that. "The Naga were going to what? After the world was killed?" Huh-wha?

"Twilight's Hammer say so," Sookie answers. "Grand plan. Find Old God to bring back. If it Dagun, we ally with naga. Naga be friends." She sniffles, in spite of an attempt to restrain herself. "Naga ruins under water. Wanted to see them. Now can't."

"I don't know about that," says Saeren. "We'll likely get to see them sooner or later." She is filing the rest of this away, of course. "So what else can you tell me about this plan, Sookie?"

Sookie scratches her head. "Not told much. Um, clan want to bring back Old Gods. Hate Titans. Clan heads know plan, nobody tell me. But, supposed to go to Stormwind, have humans there befriend me. Supposed to do stuff from book. After that, don't know."

"Stuff from a book?" asks Saeren.

Sookie gestures, imitating the woman in the fancy dress from the Torn Book Page she keeps safe aboard the Defiant. "Like this. Dunno, ran away before they teach me."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Social education by way of Nanoha."

"I see.." Saeren finds this confusing. "Well, I'm sure we can have someone teach you some of these kind of things, if you are still interested. As long as it doesn't help the Twilight's Hammer, anyway."

"Not help anyone anymore," Sookie mutters unhappily. "Take orders. Protect goshi. That life now. Nothing more important."

Saeren looks at Sookie thoughtfully, "So.. you are like a slave? What would you do, if you were free?"

The girl stares at Saeren for a few moments, rubbing her red eyes some more. "Not free." She taps the bracers on her wrists. "When freed, I die."

Nerai perks up, watching the girl, "We will help you, of course. And we already are. Sometimes help arrives in ways we don't like or understand in the beginning."

Sookie turns to look down at Nerai. "If goshi say 'Sookie, walk into water and do not stop', I obey. I drown. Nothing stop that. How help?"

"What if I were to say, 'Sookie, do what you want to, and what feels right to you forever?'" asks Saeren.

Nerai looks, "Yes, but... Has that happened?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "please swap ^^"

Sookie thinks. "I probably kill you all in your sleep, go back to cave," she announces at last.

"Why would you kill us?" asks Saeren.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Besides, I'm like Chuck Norris. I don't sleep. I wait."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "By the way, this conversation is taking place well away from any of the Southshore militia. o.o"

"Um, 'cause you a threat," Sookie says after a moment. "Ordered to find and serve master of Earthen Ring. I do that. Kagarn order me follow you. So I do that. But Twilight's Hammer all say 'kill this one' or 'kill that one'." The girl has tears in her eyes again. "Kagarn say 'kill naga', but clan say naga friend. Saeren say 'kill naga', then try to save naga. Really confusing. All dumb. Cave simple. Like cave. Nobody kill anyone, 'cept yeti but they taste good.." She puts her hands to her face and cries.

Saeren is shocked by this outburst, and does her best to move close and comfort the crying girl. "I'm sorry, Sookie. You are right, this is all very confusing, isn't it? I can try to explain, if that will help." Personally, Saeren doubts it. She also doubts she can explain it all, at this point.

> (OOC) Saeren wonders what the default of parental nurturing is. n.n

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Let auntie Saeren tell you all about who to murder.."

Sookie takes a wary step back, somewhat more wary again. "No explain. You goshi, give orders. I obey," she says, swallowing a bit.

"I'm sorry, Sookie, I'm not satisfied with that arrangement anymore," says Saeren. "You aren't going to be treated like a slave anymore. We just won't stand for that, will we, Nerai?" Right?

Nerai looks at Sookie, "If you can't understand why Saeren would save someone right after she was trying to kill them, you can't become the girl in that picture." She looks, "Explanation would be the first step in that." She looks back at Saeren, "I never thought of her that way to begin with." She smiles at Sookie, "No one told her to call me an orc, for instance."

Sookie frowns. "Still not understand then," she scowls down at Nerai. "'Splain."

"The girl in that picture would understand compassion, even for an enemy." Nerai looks at Saeren. "Saeren feels a connection to the Naga. They are part of her family, or they can be. I'll let Saeren explain that." She looks at Sookie, "We fight out of necessity. We have to kill some of the Naga, to stop them. I have to blow up the Dwarf's cave, to stop the Naga, and stop the dwarfs hurting themselves." Tears well up in her eyes, "But I don't 'because they are the enemy'. I do because they have taken things, or can be saved. Turned back into normal dwarfs, and go back to living in their mountain."

Sookie listens to Nerai with careful attention. And finally she nods and says, "Still no understand. Alliance and Horde fight. Naga and human fight. Where compassion there?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I will pose quick ^^"

> (OOC) Nerai has something too... I'll spit it out and maybe swap

Nerai smiles, "Well, come with us, and you'll see how and Orc and a Human will stand in the same room, and talk about saving each other." She shrugs, "I can't show it to you every time, many people still think in black and white, but I have seen both sides come together." She turns to Saeren, "She should also probably meet your friend."

> (OOC) Nerai is idly for dinner with family...

"Sookie, one thing you said is definitely true. We're dumb," admits Saeren. "But it can be explained pretty simply. Everything that lives, wants to keep living. And we also want to live with more joy. But sometimes, just trying to live and get the things that we think will bring more joy means we hurt others. Like killing the Yeti. Do you understand?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Time to explain life."

After a moment, Sookie nods.

Saeren smiles at Sookie, "To better get the things we want, we find others with the same experience, the same kind of lives. Since we want the same kind of things, we can help each other more often. This is why the Twilight's Hammer would help the Naga. This is also why the Alliance and Horde sometimes work together, and sometimes fight. I wish they wouldn't fight. It's wasteful and stupid."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Kagarn can critique my ethics lesson later n.n"

Sookie scratches her head. ".. No understand. But hungry. Goshi, we eat?"

"Yes, let's go find some good food," says Saeren. "I can explain more as we eat. It won't all make sense, Sookie. People don't often make sense in the way we want them to."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Objective: make it so Sookie doesn't want to kill us all."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "progress: 0/1"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "0/3"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "clearly."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I will attempt to bribe dangerous new 'team mate' with food."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "good to go, GM!"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I need Nerai's help I think. ^^;;;;; Or Tyrande."

Amongst the casualties of the beachside battle are three more heavily wounded male naga, one of whom lost a limb to a well-placed blow from a human pikeman. On advice left by Kagarn before he departed, the Southshore militia has restrained them and, reluctantly, applied basic first aid. "We hold the field," says the militia commander to Saeren, as they rendezvous above the high tide line. "I take it your mission was successful?" he says, nodding to the cliff face, where a plume of dust and smoke still rises above the waves.

Nerai nods, "Yes sir. Phase one is complete."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Also, this is Sookie. She might kill you in your sleep if we don't specifically tell her not too. Don't dick with me right now. "

Saeren looks over at the naga and frowns thoughtfully. "They won't be going anywhere for a while," she says suddenly, meaning the dwarves.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Hopefully I didn't give this dude a name before."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Captain AF1280E"

Commander Jared looks puzzled momentarily. "That... was the plan, ma'am. And if I recall, the next phase of the plan calls for us to rendezvous with the rest of our people at Azurelode."

"That sounds right to me," says Saeren. "And hopefully get a meal for Sookie, as well." That doesn't involve the flesh of a human or naga..

> (OOC) Sookie says, "nyoro~n :3"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anything else, or should we move on?"

> (OOC) Nerai is fine

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm good to go. Need to afk a bit for soup consumption ^^"

There is little problem with finding rations for any who would wish it - the army has not been in the field nearly long enough for supplies to be a problem - and the troops march onward, once again keeping to the forest to avoid being spotted by the enemy. It is not long before they reach the major roads and strike out toward the west.

Saeren is the first to hear the sound of airship engines in the distance. Jared immediately orders his troops to take cover in the woods as a precaution, but it does not take long for Nerai to recognize the all-too-familiar roar of the Defiant's engines.

Nerai calls out, "It's fine. It's our friend, come to escort us!" She looks at Saeren, and mutters, "At least, I hope it's Kagarn."

The airship lands by the road and Kagarn dismounts. "Regrettably, the Forsaken are reluctant to join in the fight," he reports. "Hopefully, Saeren, your mission for assistance will prove more successful."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Any further commentary, or should I continue? Saeren's mission is to strike out solo overland for Hillsbrad and Dalaran, bearing a sealed letter from Maleb."

> (OOC) Nerai doesn't have anything useful to add at this point, really.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "all good."

> (OOC) Saeren returns.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "You all just need to decide what to do about the Defiant."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "keep it the hell out of sight."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Arm it with nukes."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Seriously, though... It's Nerai's ship, but we can provide commentary."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "In the meantime:"

> (OOC) Nerai O\_o

> (OOC) Nerai maintains now ownership of things.

> (OOC) Nerai says, "No."

Moving past Saeren, the shaman continues to greet the rest of his companions. "I see you are in good health, Sookie. Did all go well in my absence?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Yeah, she said she was going to kill us all in our sleep if she was free, so things were status quo. Hamburger."

"Yah," Sookie announces. "Found Saeren no like taste of naga."

Saeren gives Kagarn a look in which she attempts to say 'we need to talk in private later' without saying a word.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Gotta give him the 411 on his new psychotic.. uh.. charge."

Nerai looks at Sookie, "Hot first hand, mind..."

Kagarn's eyes glaze over for a brief moment as he attempts to re-compose himself. "I see," he says to Sookie, carefully non-committally, before addressing Saeren again. "On that note, were you able to take any naga prisoners?"

Saeren nods to Kagarn, "Yes, we were, and there were some left over from the larger battle, as well. I should have saved three myself, but I mis-read the signs." She sighs in disappointment. "When we have a chance, I am going to study and ensure this doesn't happen again."

Jared frowns. "I still don't understand why you wanted them, Stormhoof," he says. "Except for the witch, none of them will be able to provide any high-level intelligence. And it's not easy to interrogate the naga anyway - take it from me."

Kagarn smiles. "All will be revealed momentarily," he says. "Show me the prisoners. Saeren, if you will accompany me? The time has come for you to save them."

"Sookie, you should observe this as well," adds the shaman. "Though perhaps the purpose will be less clear to you for the moment."

> (OOC) TidesGM continues posing unless someone stops him.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I'll stop posing for.... <pinky> one MILLION dollars."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "What the hell is Sookie going to do with $1,000,000?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Eat it."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "And pay someone to kill us in our sleep."

The naga, by now, have achieved consciousness, though they have said nothing to their captors, not even a demand for refreshment. Kagarn moves along them, restoring them to some semblance of health while ignoring the muttered oaths in Nazja. "Saeren, if you would care to do the honors?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "The witch and two of the myrmidons will be turned. This is all yours to pose if you wish, Saeren."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Okay :)"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Does the one-arm myrm turn?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Yes, he's one of them."

Saeren nods to Kagarn and gets to work. She moves to the naga, kneeling first by the witch. Her words come in Nazja, whispered gently, "What I offer you is the chance to break the chains that bind you. It is your choice, to come out of the darkness and into the light. Know this: you are not alone. If you take this path, you are my family; many are your brothers and sisters. They will welcome you as I will." She raises the chalice then, spilling the water into the mouth of the Naga Witch. "I ask you to come back, to be your own once more."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Or I could just rip you limb from limb."

> (OOC) Saeren leaves that small print out.. \*cough\* Poses more.

The Naga looks back at Saeren, suspicious at first, even fearful for a moment. As the water is spilt, the courage of this fallen witch is revealed as she accepts what is offered, her body changing, the curse vanishing. Saeren holds the new Lamia gently, kissing her forehead, "Welcome back."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "And more one more."

The same offer is granted to the others, who one by one refuse or accept. Finally, the maimed Myrmidon is all that remains. His acceptance again brings delight to Saeren. "Rest now, brother. You must recover your strength. There is a long road ahead for us all. Soon we will walk it together."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm assuming he's still only got one arm, but he's not scary anymore."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Indeed. Regenerating limbs requires a sort of magic this chalice doesn't do. Kagarn will be able to take care of it later, but for now he wants to conserve his strength."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "(I actually need to look up the details of healing that regenerates limbs. Later.)"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "there's a specific spell in the College of Healing that does it after a month, and another more expensive one that works immediately"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "either way, Kagarn easily has enough manpower here to do the ceremony for it"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "But for now, moving on is okay :)"

Commander Jared and the other humans observe the proceedings with frank astonishment. "What sorcery is this?" demands the militia commander.

> (OOC) Saeren poses.

"It's not sorcery, it's freedom from a curse, Commander, made possible by.. well, you wouldn't believe me if I told you, honestly." Saeren rises and faces the commander, "For now, we must go on. These two will be joining us. I ask that you treat them kindly and forgive what came before. They are my family now."

Jared frowns. "Are you out of your mind? These 'lamia' of yours were trying to _kill_ us just this morning, and now you want us to let them go?"

"They will come with us, of course," says Saeren. "And I might point out that you probably felt the same way about Tauren just a few short days ago, Commander."

The lamia witch speaks up. "We do not blame them, Lady Saeren. The humans have ample reason to mistrust our kind. Any being can see scales transformed to skin, but few can see a transformation of the soul." She turns to Jared. "I can tell you this, though: you will not be free of the plague of our former kin until you and your people capture the old ruins on Purgation Isle. We - _they_ have corrupted the place to the service of Dagun."

Sookie tugs quietly at Saeren's sleeve. "Give chalice to me," she asks.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Ummm... n.n"

Kagarn notes the skeptical expression on Saeren's face, and nods to her. "It will be all right," he assures the night elf.

Saeren smiles at Kagarn. "If you are sure it won't hurt her." She offers the chalice to Sookie.

Sookie accepts the cup, pours water conjured from her outstretched hand into it, and takes a drink.

> (OOC) Saeren waits for Sookie to suddenly grow a beard or something. n.n

> (OOC) TidesGM cracks his knuckles. Now let's see...

The first sensation Sookie experiences is a voice. _Hello, sister,_ breathes the spirit of a water elemental. _It is good to meet you._

_This tastes better than water from a rock,_ Sookie thinks. _I hope Saeren lets me keep one of these. This is so useful! I wish I'd had one before._

> (OOC) TidesGM heh.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'll just dupe it using some kinda zone trick n.n"

_Thank you,_ replies the spirit. _The taste was not so great, when the naga first bound me to this device in torment. You are among good people. They saved me from my pain._

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "We'll probably leave it at that. Sookie probably won't believe the minor elemental spirit any more than she believes anyone else."

Sookie finishes the cup and hands it back. "Taste good. Better than rock," she announces.

"Let me know when you would like to drink again," says Saeren. For now, the chalice is put away.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So, it's time for Saeren to do her little run for help, right?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Correct."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Alright, what dice do I need to throw? :D I'll be riding the Shade express."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I wouldn't bother with dice at this point. Nothing in the woods of Hillsbrad is going to spot you if you don't want to be spotted."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sweet. Shall I pose, or are you going to cover it? :D"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I'm going to pose some setup first."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "kk"

The Defiant is sent up again with its temporary human pilots, this time on orders to await a call from Kagarn, and in the meantime to simply avoid engagements. The rest of the army will proceed to Azurelode and take up positions. And Saeren will proceed alone, on the back of her feline friend, to Hillsbrad and then to Dalaran, to seek assistance.

As the messenger speeds off into the northwest, the militia fades into the wood again. It is near nightfall when they reach the site of the mine. A force of Dagun's minions already surrounds the entrance, consisting mostly of murlocs with a handful of converted dwarven riflemen. "A skeleton force," confides Sathrin, the lamia - still bound, but accepting her fate graciously. "Naga cannot so easily travel on land. We have at least another day before the full army arrives."

Jared orders the main force of the militia to dig in, and sends scouting parties into the countryside. Though his force could probably break the current siege, he would rather not be caught in the field if the main army arrives sooner than advertised.

---

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "We now switch back to Saeren."

> (OOC) Saeren goes to Dalaran 'So, any of you nerds wanna fight?'

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Saeren, you will find Hillsbrad already making preparations for war. You will be asked if you are a companion of Ezra's when you arrive, and generally find the townspeople more ready to believe you than you might have otherwise expected."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "That forsaken is dead useful!"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So, I'll pose to that effect..."

Saeren races across the terrain, no more detectible than a ghost. Below her, Shade leaves no trail for the eye, racing on to Hillsbrad. Arriving there in such haste, Saeren is met with surprising welcome. She expected more pointy things to be aimed at her. It seems everyone knows her name and there is no sign of surprise at her appearance. Her explanation of the plan cuts quickly to the chase. She only hopes her words are enough. Diplomacy is something she shoots arrows from, it is not one of her skills.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Let me know when you're done posing or would like some assistance."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Will I be getting help?"

> (OOC) Saeren Assumes yes.. just want to be sure ^^

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Hillsbrad will indeed be sending forces to assist Azurelode. You'll be advised to proceed on to Dalaran with your report."

The words are enough. Thankfully it seems Ezra has already done the convincing from behind the scenes. With the assurances of Hillsbrad behind her, it is with more hope that the Night Elf blazes a trail to Dalaran, moving faster still.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "when you need help, send a horribly burned dead guy with a bad reputation ahead of you!"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'd say by now, Ezra's rep is pretty damn good n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Except with over-bearing asshole Night Elf druids n.n"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Staghelm is now a separate, hostile faction. o.o"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I'm going to pose for Dalaran, if you don't mind."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Please do :)"

As with Hillsbrad, Dalaran is beginning its own preparations for war by the time Saeren arrives. "So soon?" says the mage-lord who debriefs Saeren. "When your Forsaken companion arrived, we thought we might have weeks, or even months to prepare. I suppose that was a foolish hope on our part." He stands up. "Very well, then. We cannot spare many yet, but a platoon of war-mages will accompany you to Azurelode. With luck we will arrive by midday tomorrow."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Any response, or shall I proceed?"

"Anything you can send, we gratefully accept," says Saeren. "I greatly appreciate your haste in preparations, as well. So few have been ready when the call came." She knows of Dalaran's reputation, and asks, "What do the mage-lords of Dalaran know of our enemy?"

"To be honest, we had considered the naga little more than a nuisance until now," is the reply. "We have helped repel a few minor naga raids on Southshore in the past, and in the Second War they were a nuisance to shipping, but we had not prepared for them as a concerted threat. What little we 'know' about the threat they pose, we have learned from Ezra Pyreborn."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "brb, bio."

> (OOC) Sookie yaay ezra

"I see," says Saeren. "Well, you will soon get an opportunity to catch-up on this interesting bit of lore. If Ezra mentioned the Lamia, you may be pleased to know that should we survive this battle, you will get to meet some of them. Three more are freed of the curse."

"We will be intrigued to... meet them," replies the mage. Something in his manner suggests that he'd been about to say 'study', but thought better of it.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Any response to that, or shall we wrap up the siege of Azurelode?"

Saeren arches an eyebrow. "Well, I'm sure it will be educational for all involved," says the Night Elf.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Let's do it!"

---

When the history of the War of the Turning Tides is written, the Battle for Azurelode will go down as one of the most one-sided to date, in favor of the forces of order. Jared's scouts quickly apprise the Hillsbrad reinforcements of the situation, and the combined forces prepare an ambush for the naga forces, taking up hidden positions in the nearby woods.

A formidable-looking army of naga - mostly myrmidons protecting the naga mages - makes its way warily toward Azurelode, only to be caught as soon as they step into the open outside Azurelode. On land, the humans have vastly superior mobility, and the human commanders use this to devastating effect, mowing down the slower myrmidons with ease while avoiding the powerful counterstrike from the witches and sirens.

The naga quickly recognize that they are outflanked, and call back their besieging forces to help cover their retreat. Reluctant to attack the dwarves with deadly force, the humans are able only to slow the naga attempt to escape - but slowing them is sufficient, as it gives time for the warmages to arrive behind their lines, penetrate the naga's magical defenses, and mop up the remaining infantry.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I hope we can capture a few dozen ^^"

By sundown, it is all over. Several dozen naga, male and female alike, are captured alive, as are the vast majority of the corrupted dwarves. Dalaran's mages swarm around the captive dwarves and lamia, eager to confirm Ezra's observations and extend their understanding further.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "It would take weeks to turn all the naga captives with just one chalice. Twenty-four hours without saltwater and the healers you have on hand will suffice for the dwarves."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Saeren will keep working until she's exhausted, of course. n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Like, basically passes out or is pulled away by someone ^^;;"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "It's not a matter of endurance, Saeren. The chalice itself has a limit to what it can do - think of it as having a relatively small fatigue pool that takes a day to regenerate from zero."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "but stay tuned."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Ahhh, got ya."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Maybe these nerds from Dalaran can help! Err.. I mean.."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "These mage-lords \*cough\*"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "They can't make bricks without straw. Once you all capture Purgation Isle, you can definitely convert it to your needs."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "But stay tuned, Sookie may have something up her sleeve..."

> (OOC) Sookie is on it.

The half-elemental girl has figured out by now the relationship between the chalice and the captives, and approaches Saeren again. "Na, na, let me have it again," she asks. "I help."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "oh god you're actually having her say 'na, na'."

Saeren nods to Sookie, offering the chalice once more. "Of course.. it seems to exhaust its powers rather quickly, I'm afraid."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Na, na?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "There's a meme."

"I know. I help with that." Sookie studies the cup carefully. "By the way.... what her name?"

"Her name?" asks Saeren. "Who?"

"The spirit in the cup," Sookie replies casually. "Cup you are using. You offer her freedom too? Like me?"

Saeren looks surprised, "I actually don't know her name. Could you find out for me?" Curiouser and curiouser. "We purified the chalice with some help." A lot of help, really. "Is that what she would call freedom?"

"Don't know. Guess you not ask, goshi." Sookie cradles the cup in one arm. "No offer freedom to elemental. Best to use them as glove. Free elemental not your friend. You wise that way." She starts to walk away.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "For the record, the cup's spirit would have even less understanding of the concept of freedom than Sookie ever could."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "yep. and thats kind of the point"

"Is that what you want for yourself?" asks Saeren of Sookie. "To be.. used like a glove?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Kagarn will step in."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "but only when you two are done."

Sookie shrugs. "Want venison. Want cave. Anything else orders, goshi."

> (OOC) Sookie has nothing else.

"The concept of freedom makes little sense to elementals, Saeren," comments Kagarn, who has overheard this exchange. "To be an elemental is to be a part of the great fabric of the cosmos. They have little freedom beyond that pattern, any more than a dropped stone is free to choose not to fall."

"And if you were _wholly_ an elemental, Sookie, that would be the end of it," he continues. "But there is a part of you that is not elemental. That part of you will eventually become dissatisfied with living in servitude. When that day comes, we will help you."

> (OOC) TidesGM edits that slightly.

"When that day comes, goshi, you might die," Sookie answers softly. "I go learn rune, help dwarves."

"That's the same as every day," says Saeren.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Kagarn will say no more on the matter. She's right, of course; and it's something Kagarn is willing to risk. But he is still in the business of planting seeds in Sookie's mind, and it's not exactly the most fertile of soil."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Na na. Yeti blood makes good fertilizer."

> (OOC) Sookie is good to go :)

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Yeah, Sookie is kinda scary ^^;;"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I'm running low on ideas for this session. :) Next session will be the battle for Purgation Isle, at which point I need to break out the mass combat rules."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "good close then."

> (OOC) TidesGM notes: XP - Nerai - 2

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Yay I has more Lamia friends."

> (OOC) TidesGM notes: XP - Saeren - 2
