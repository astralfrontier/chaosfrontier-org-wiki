Krasus was right. Ezra was very surprised to feel the power of the Kirin Tor's teleportation room - more than enough energy to direct a Gate to the proper place, and energy to spare to punch through the Twisting Nether beforehand, guiding it to the exact spot he visualized.

From the cool climes of Dalaran's environs, the four knights of the Argent Dawn step out into the humidity of an island on the eastern sea. To the west, the Exodar rises out of the mountain into which it crash-landed. The exotic building materials are now inextricably bound to the rock of Azeroth; it will likely never fly again. It may not need to, muses the wizard - the Burning Crusade, the enemies of these strange alien folk, seem quite interested in this world already.

Some sort of activity seems to have sprung up in front of the downed citadel. The paladins approach it; Ezra and Krasus follow, both looking about to satisfy their respective curiosities. Night elves and draenei mingle together. Food is being served - Azerothian dishes, Ezra notes after a moment. But no lamia are here yet. _Well, that will take time, I expect,_ he thinks to himself.

The knights are greeted with cheers and waves and shouts from the tables. Information is exchanged; a messenger is sent running down the ramp into the innards of the otherworldly craft. There is time for food, and gossip. Ezra's glowing eyes narrow as he watches it all.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "this seems like it'll go straight to the top, so here goes."

The prophet Velen radiates wisdom from every fiber of his being. Even among these creatures who so closely resemble demons, with their horns and hooves and tendrils growing out of their faces, his eyes and his demeanor, and that faint smile of .. recognition? - all conspire to convince Ezra that this man will be able to help the knights.

"I know you," says the prophet, as the four paladins approach the dais on which he stands, and he sends away those lessers with whom he'd been consulting. "I am Velen of the Draenei, men and women of the Argent Dawn."

The knights are kneeling before they recognize that they've done it. "Bryan Chesterton, sir. My companions. Barlowe Grace, Gregor the Just, the Lady Sarah Silverton." Perhaps for a moment Chesterton was going to recite their deeds, to impress upon this old man the people addressing him, but clearly there is no need. He lets out a sigh of relief.

Velen inclines his head to each. "Your sacrifices and your battles have been much the same as our own, men of Lordaeron," he announces. "Some of that which you are about to tell me is known to us. Some will be new. In a day's time, I wish you to speak in the Crystal Halls, to address the leaders of our houses and guilds, and other influential folk. We are few, and many of those who departed their home world perished in the journey. For now we will learn of each other."

Bryan Chesterton smiles. "We thank you."

Velen gestures to Krasus and Ezra. "O'ros has a wish to speak to you both, each alone. Please proceed below and present yourselves to the honor guard."

**You have made interesting progress since our last conversation, Ezra Pyreborn,** announces the 'voice' of O'ros, after the wizard presented himself and was admitted. **Very interesting indeed.**

"I have you to thank, ssir," Ezra replies quietly. "My family iss ssafe now. We are not reunited sso much as reconciled, a fate which I find.. acceptable, yess. And sso our effortss to ssecure this world continue with renewed hope on the eastern continent."

**These four who have come today will go away disappointed,** Oros replies. **They have been told a lie, one which you will find familiar. It will do no good to confront them on this matter. One will soon arise, strong in the Light and capable of confronting this lie. It is necessary that this lie remain in place for now, to spur him to action.**

Ezra frowns. But if nothing can be done about this for now, very well. The matter will be dealt with. He changes topics. "And the Sacred Fire? I feel presumptuous to ask for an oracle on thiss, but... I sstill have some doubt."

The twinkling lights of the naaru shift for a moment. **Your efforts to bring the Forsaken, and perhaps the Horde, into a common cause with us, and with the Alliance of your world as well? I will say only this. Beware that it does not become a new point of contention. Do not let the Light and Fire become enemies. You walk a fine line. In the service of the Light, you will be held accountable and judged by your actions, however this matter turns out. In the service of your people, however, I believe that you have done well.**

The wizard starts to protest, but holds his tongue. **I know that you do not think of yourself as serving the Holy Light, Ezra,** O'ros continues in amusement. **You wish to serve your family. It is that selfless service itself, that emotion - whatever its object - that makes you part of our union. Go now. Continue your work.**

Ezra tips his hat politely, and goes.

Krasus has emerged from his own interview with O'ros bearing a peculiar bemused look. Clearly not everything went as expected, but it didn't seem to end badly. Ezra feels a brief twinge of shadenfreude at the seeming vexation of what must be a senior mage of the Kirin Tor, but he says nothing aloud.

Barlowe Grace finds the pair. "Bryan's still speaking with Velen," he explains. "I'm sent to find you, if you are finished." The two wizards nod, and Barlowe gestures around him at the Exodar. "This place is amazing, but these people.. I have to say. Our supporters consist mostly of villagers and peasants. Good men, but not quite rid of the prejudices and superstitions of their upbringing. They may not be ready to fight alongside such.. exotic allies."

The knight's shoulders slump a bit. "I was once a member of the Scarlet Crusade. I participated in some of their more.. zealous moments. I regret that now, and I've worked to support the Argent Dawn's ideals. But even now, I have to wonder. Was coming here for the best?"

Krasus claps a friendly hand on Barlowe's shoulder. "Now, how can you say that?" he asks affably, his former mood melting away. "These people seem to venerate the same Holy Light that you do. You lot will find a way."

Bryan Chesterton speaks aloud to the assembled throngs of draenei that Velen and his aides have gathered. Pockets of Broken stoop here and there amid the tall, powerful-looking warriors and scholars of the Exodar, but all listen as the paladin paints in glowing terms the struggle of the Argent Dawn and the people of the Eastern Kingdoms. For almost three hours he talks, explaining the history of Azeroth, of the Burning Crusade's attacks on it, and of the need to fight off both the undead and the naga menaces that threaten the safety of the world.

Lady Sarah Silverton aids the presentation. With some knowledge of the arcane, she conjures forth image after image, and finds it pleasantly surprising that the draenei have the ability to capture and record such imagery for later consultation via some sort of device. She, too, spends time speaking - of the Well of Eternity and its role in the Burning Crusade's plans for the world, and of the naga who now dwell at the heart of where the Well once rested.

"It becomes clear," concludes Bryan to the gathered draenei, "that we are alike in the ways that matter most. Our hearts, our camaraderie, and the strength of our steel. You have shown me your dedication today in your questions and in what we all have learned. We.. we may not be ready for the full might of the draenei at this time, and we have no right to ask you to commit a great force to this far-off cause. But we hope that you will heed the call for heroes to protect Lordaeron."

In time, decisions are made, as the throng breaks up into groups. Boros, Kuros and Aesom of the Hand of Argus have agreed to this much - some of their Vindicators will be sent back, under the command of someone named 'Kom the Dissident' - a paladin of great skill, but temperamental politics. As Boros explains it to Chesterton: "he exhibits the traits of the Hand: bravery, intelligence, and honor. Obedience, perhaps not so much. But he will be good for what you need."

For now, a representative group of draenei will accompany the Argent Dawn back to their chapel, to be ambassadors of their kind to the people of Lordaeron. Bryan accepts this quietly. It's more than he could have perhaps received, but Ezra can see his face registering disappointment during the talks.

---

The draenei and their night elf guests have no further news about Teldrassil, much to Ezra's disappointment. There is unsettled business, and the wizard feels that it's time to move on. He has done what he could here.

"You fellowss will be alright with Krassus, yess," he assures Chesterton as he says his goodbyes again. "For now, I'm due in Moonglade. A meeting of the Horde's leadersship iss in order, for a very important bit of bussiness to the north of you - Ssilvermoon City and the blood elves, yes. And other matters. The Alliance on Kalimdor should be represented as well."

"Thank you for your help, Ezra," smiles Chesterton, pumping Ezra's hand unexpectedly. The wizard pauses for a brief moment, watching the face of a living human taking his bandaged and charred limb without a moment of hesitation. He's too surprised to even put strength into the grip. _Perhaps there is hope after all._

"Well then, I'm off. Good-bye." And Ezra is gone.
