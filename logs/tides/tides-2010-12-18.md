# Turning Tides 2010-12-18

> (OOC) Log "Tides-2010-12-18" started by Ezra at Sun Dec 19 02:30:17 2010 CST (OOC)

Krasus opens the way for the Argent Dawn's knights and their cadre of draenei allies. All are well-armed and fortified for what lies ahead.

As they step through the portal, the blue-skinned champions of the Light gasp. Before their eyes, the Plaguelands stretch out as a blight upon nature and righteousness. The Argent Dawn's heroes, used to such horrors, barely react. Krasus has not chosen to come along - he has still more business to see to. The last one through the portal, then, is Ezra Pyreborn.

Light's Hope Chapel is not far on foot. The chapel's defenders arm and alert themselves as the draenei draw near, but urgent explanations from Bryan Chesterton convince the paladins that these newcomers are not demons, and that they mean well. To demonstrate their intentions, these Hands of Argus spread out amongst some of the Dawn's recently returned patrols, using some sort of innate power to heal their wounds. Each use is accompanied with a sigil of light which springs to life on their brow. The Argent Dawn has no further objection.

> (OOC) TidesGM has connected.

> (OOC) Ezra says, "assumed status quo: Naxxramas stands, Alexandros Mograine is parked up there with Corrupted Ashbringer, Baron Rivendare is in Stratholme. Changes to canon: Renault Mograine has been ousted from SM. Has he been outed as his father's killer?"

> (OOC) Ezra says, "it hasn't happened on cambot yet anyway"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "It has not yet happened, no."

> (OOC) Ezra says, "k. here goes then:"

The Chapel is buzzing with activity. Rumors that either Baron Rivendare of Stratholme or Kel'Thuzad the lich are preparing to move on the humans of Lordaeron has forced the Argent Dawn to consider strikes directly into the hearts of their enemies' territory.

The floating Scourge citadel of Naxxramas has recently been sighted taking position near Stratholme. The best intelligence the Argent Dawn has available to them suggests that Kel'Thuzad commands the necropolis, and nobody has any reason to believe that the lich and Rivendare are hostile to each other.

As the draenei gradually become acclimated to their new surroundings, despite some lingering mistrust from the former Scarlet soldiers who now call the Chapel home, Ezra briefly listens in on some of these discussions.

One young man in particular, Darion Mograine by name, is advocating for an assault on Naxxramas itself, and is calling for assistance in doing so. A few brief inquiries inform the mage that this Darion is Renault's brother, prompting a brief burst of unholy laughter.

One figure at the Chapel does draw Ezra's attention - a robed and masked figure. This one Ezra does know, and by more than reputation. This is one of Bates' men - and by extension one of Varimathras'. He goes by the name Castillian.

Drawing this figure aside, Ezra speaks softly. "Varimathrass iss dead, friend. I know your ssecret. I know your planss. I choose not to expose you to thesse people, if I believe I can trusst you, yess." He waits, but the other mage gives no sign yet.

"Varimathrass' notess were recovered. His plotss are known to the Banshee Queen." Ezra leans on his walking stick, watching his counterpart. "There iss.. no more need for betrayal. If you disagree, we will take it up with the paladins. What ssay you?"

Perhaps the most telling response Castillian can offer is the removal of his mask. Behind it is the pock-marked face of the undead, carefully screened with herbs and a masking ointment to conceal the smell. "Vari-math-ras-is-dead," he replies haltingly. "No-mas-ter-to-be-tray-them-to-now. I-will-fight-the-un-dead-here. Tell-Un-der-ci-ty." Ezra smiles and tips his hat.

Ezra learns something else interesting. One of the Scarlet loremasters who fled from the destruction of the Monastery brought away a number of books, among them a study of the far-distant continent of Northrend. More a lover of knowledge than a hater of the undead, and determined to rescue his precious library from the rapacious (and largely illiterate) Scourge, this man has been speaking to anyone he can find. "The necropoli are _Nerubian_ in design," he will say excitedly. "The Lich King fought hardest against the Nerubians, and out of respect much of his architecture follows their outlines. But for the necropoli to fly, they must certainly follow a particular internal plan."

With this and other similar information, young Darion manages to assemble a total of forty men - handpicked volunteers from the Argent Dawn, zealots from Scarlet Crusade who are itching for payback and not particular about their target, and even some of the draenei who feel the need to prove themselves to these short and mistrusting pink-skinned folk.

And as Ezra bids his goodbyes to the Chapel on his way to Tranquillien, he wishes the warriors well. "To ssave our world," he counsels the loremaster, "we will need every weapon we may find. To fight enemiess in the ssea, we will need castless in the ssky. Sseek out the source of the necropolis' powerss of levitation, and you will have done uss all a great sservice, yess."

Armed with a list of conspirators thanks to Daniel Bates' conversion and the liberation of notes from Varimathras and Balnazzar, Ezra's role in this strange city is more diplomat than detective.

It has been a long time since he visited the Ghostlands. He thinks back, remembering some of the comrades he met here, some of the elves he helped, and of the Forsaken. For the first time in their unlives, they had met creatures both alike and opposite them. Alike in their desperation, their dire peril, and their rejection by the world. Different in that the Forsaken are horrid and haunted beings, while the blood elves are lithe and vibrant and beautiful. _This is what the Horde is made of,_ he muses to himself. _Outcastes forced to retreat and who found themselves at each others' backs._

Master Chef Mouldier is his first stop. The blood elven cook is surrounded by a halo of heat and steam, and greets Ezra as the mage enters the inn. "It's been awhile, archaeologist," he announces. "Supplies are a tad spartan here, but make yourself at home."

> (OOC) Ezra throws in some gratuitous pop culture references.

In time, Apothecary Renzithen enters the Inn, and Ezra flags him down.

The two have a short, quiet conversation. The elves aren't privy to it. Other Forsaken are gently waved away by Ezra - except for one, Apothecary Venustus, who happens in.

And at the end of the discussion, Ezra slides a parchment scrap across the table. The two Forsaken pen their signatures to it in silence. The mage gets up, tips his hat politely, and departs the inn.

"High Executor Mavren will see you," one of the deathguards announces gruffly. Ezra nods politely and steps into the ruined tower serving as Tranquillien's civic center.

Inside the domed structure, the High Executor - an armored Forsaken soldier - is accompanied by two blood elf women. One Ezra already knows from previous conversations, named Valwyn. The other is the leader of Tranquillien, with whom he didn't previously speak. Now matters have become more grave than a simple dig for artifacts. "Dame Auriferouss," the mage says, bowing low. "It iss a pleasure to return to your fair town."

"Mavren has spoken to me of your mission," Auriferous announces regally. Ezra watches her carefully-monitored body language: _here indeed is a politician,_ he thinks. "Whatever secrets of the Forsaken you've come here to uncover concern Tranquillien and hence concern me. You will not speak of treachery among my people without my presence."

"I undersstand, my lady," Ezra answers with another bow. "It iss ignorance of the ssituation obtaining in the Ghosstlandss that did not bring your name to the forefront of my mind, and not intent to deceive, no. I have traveled far and sseen much, and it hass been too long, yess. Too long."

Dame Auriferous nods; this explanation seems to have satisfied her for the moment. "We face hard times, Ezra Pyreborn. We must be able to trust everyone here, with our lives. I wish to see this evidence you've brought that some of our people were planning betrayal." The mage duly presents a thick sheaf of notes, along with the loyalty oaths the two apothecaries so recently signed. The blood elf scans these with narrowed eyes, then presents the material to Mavren with a brief nod.

"You say that this plot ultimately involved two dreadlords, and the naga?" she asks carefully. Ezra inclines his head. "It iss so, my lady."

Auriferous allows the High Executor time to conclude his own study, then returns Ezra's paperwork to him. As the mage slips the notes back into the inner pocket of his coat, she speaks again. "There were no other conspirators, to anyone's knowledge. If rumor is true, there are two tasks that I wish to ask of you."

"Name them," the mage answers calmly.

"First, it is said that elements of the Forsaken have been working with the Alliance on something, some business concerning a unification of military forces. I see now that this is you, and whatever allies or masters you work for, and that the threat you wish to defeat is the naga."

"If this is the case, then you should know that Darnassian spies lurk on our borders. Word already reached us that a dwarf sent from their mountain has been outed as a traitor and spy. You should go to these night elves and send them on their way, before.. something should happen to them." The blood elf stares at Ezra. "For the good of our peace, will you do this?"

Ezra thinks this over. "I will sspeak to them. I am not deputized by the Ssentinelss, of coursse... sso I may make no promisess."

Auriferous waves a hand. "That's understood. The second matter, then. Blood elves have begun making a pilgrimage to the south of the continent. Windrunner Village has long since fallen, as has the spire that guided ships along the northern coast. The pilgrimage is long and dangerous, but necessary. Go north, to Fairbreeze Village, and you will learn more. Help our fellows. We are in danger of ceasing to exist, and every one of us that falls is precious."

"There iss the matter of the naga. It iss what I musst pursue, my lady," Ezra answers, waiting to see what this woman will say. _She knows something,_ he thinks.

"The naga, yes. We've seen murlocs on the coast, near the anchorage," she replies. "They will have more information. Perhaps useful to your mission."

Ezra smiles. "Then I thank you, yess. I will ssee to these matterss presently. With your leave..." And with a brief nod of assent from the Dame, he tips his hat and goes.
