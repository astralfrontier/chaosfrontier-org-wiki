# Turning Tides 2011-01-02

> (OOC) Log "Tides-2011-01-02" started by TidesGM at Sun Jan 2 17:57:33 2011 CST (OOC)

As the force had approached the island earlier in the morning, Mage-Warlord Kian Morley made some estimates of the defending forces, and judged them inferior to his own force. Accordingly, his initial plan was to engage the naga positions with a full frontal assault.

However, as the magical fog clears, he can see that the naga are preparing their defenses with care - an all-out assault is likely to be mired in a trap. Accordingly, he adapts his battle plan - the archers and militiamen of Southshore will put slow but steady pressure on the naga lines, while the battle-mages focus on points of heaviest resistance.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Mechanically: Morley adopted All-Out Attack; the naga adopted Deliberate Defense. Since the naga gave up the initiative, Morley had the option of changing his strategy, and adopted Deliberate Attack."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "PCs: Please declare your Risk Modifiers, then pose any significant actions you wish to undertake. In Sookie's case, although /she/ doesn't have a choice, I'll allow her player to decide what Kagarn orders her to do."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'll take the high risk, cause hey, I want to saves lives on both sides."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So basically we're on the water, attacking an island, right? Can someone get Shade the ability to walk on water? \*cough Shaman\*"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "You've already established a beachhead on the island."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Ah, okay. ^^"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Your enemies consist of murloc spearmen, heavily armored naga myrmidons, and an assortment of naga female spellcasters."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. Saeren, you can either pose or roll first as you see fit; if you roll first and succeed, you could pose the successful results as well. roll 3d6 at 9, or roll 3d6 at 10 if you wish to take a leadership role amongst the human attackers."

> (OOC) Nerai waits for Saeren, then has a pose.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'll go for a leadership roll."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Err, role."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. Roll dice and pose, or pose and roll dice."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Rolling first n.n;;"

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d6 for 9 (2 6 1)

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Phew!"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So can I pose general conditions as I do this, too? :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I'm not sure what you mean, but I'll provisionally allow it. If I see something I don't deem appropriate, I'll ask you to amend it accordingly :)"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Well, I mean, to describe why Saeren is charging forward, men struggling in a spot, that kinda thing :)"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Basically context of what I'm doing."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Sounds good. Go for it."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "By the way, nothing stops us from resolving all this in parallel (unless the PCs want to pose working together in the /same/ unit)."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "So Nerai and Sookie are welcome to declare their intentions before Saeren finishes."

> (OOC) Sookie is going with Risk +3, has relevant ability for another +1, but has no interest in leading dumb humans anywhere.

With the heavy fortifications of the naga lying straight ahead and the attack showing signs of floundering in the face of stiff resistance, Saeren leaps onto the back of Shade. She charges from the line of archers towards a wall of Naga and Murlocs. Her bow sings and her arrows rain down, fire trailing from the darts. The arrows shatter upon impact, maiming those struck and causing a building panic in the enemy lines.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Is that okay, and should I add more?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "That's excellent, Saeren. This is pretty much free-form posing here."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "You can add more if you want, or you can leave it at that if you want."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Meanwhile, Sookie can roll 3d6 at 9."

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 12 (4 6 2) vs. 9, failing by 3

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. Sookie's actions don't substantially turn the tide one way or another. You can pose or not pose as you see fit."

> (OOC) TidesGM checks Brendan.

> (OOC) Nerai will pose her pose then let someone decide what that counts as?

Sookie had an idea. Since archers can only point in one direction, she would sneak up behind them and unleash her lightning bolts. With some careful maneuvering, she gets into position... unaware that there's other units of naga archers further up the mountains. With a yelp of surprise, she dodges a volley of arrows and dives off the side of the path, getting out of sight before she gets shot.

Nerai steps out, surrounded and enclosed in the mechanical monstrosity that is Eecee. She looks around her, farmers with swords looking up to the hidden Goblin with awe, wonder, disgust, but mostly confusion. She sees the Murlocs approaching and she points her giant sized broadsword, "We fight. We Win." She says simply, pointing the direction forward. Before waiting for a response, she charges, getting Eecee up to a running gate as she meets the line of Murlocks and Naga, pressing into their force with her forceful charge.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. That /looks/ like a Risk Modifier of +3, using a relevant skill (broadsword ) for +1, and leading a force for +1."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "So "roll 3d6 at 10"."

> (OOC) Nerai rolls 3d6 for 6 (1 3 2) vs. 10, succeeding by 4

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Excellent."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I will now roll the Misfortunes of War roll. Thanks to your actions, allied casualties were only 5%, so my base target number is 5, increased to 8 because you all took Risk Modifier +3."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Alphabetical order: Nerai, Saeren, Sookie."

> (OOC) Sookie prepares for death

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 13 (3 4 6) vs. 8, failing by 5

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 10 (1 3 6) vs. 8, failing by 2

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 13 (5 4 4) vs. 8, failing by 5

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "None of you took any injuries."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "The dice love us, for once."

The naga forces, despite their devotion to the dark gods of the sea, cannot prevail for long against such numbers, and the heroic efforts of the adventurers break through the defenses at crucial points. Naga and murloc corpses litter the ramp, and the forces of the Hillsbrad Foothills press upward.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Round 1 of the battle is over. The allied forces take 5% casualties; the enemy takes 25%."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Round 2:"

With the initial assault, it becomes clear that the Alliance forces have an overwhelming advantage. Accordingly, Lord Morley decides to take a chance and bring the battle to a decisive end. While the bulk of his forces continue to engage the enemy along the ramp up the island, Morley will lead a hand-picked team of his best battle-mages and archers. Keeping a low profile, his team will move beneath the shoulder of the hill, and then suddenly advance up the hillside to catch the defenders by surprise.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Mechanically: Morley adopted Indirect Attack with a risk modifier of +3. The naga adopted Defense."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Players, declare your Risk Modifier, roll, and pose. If you are taking a Risk Modifier of +3, you can join Morley's assault team or you can serve as part of the diversion on the main front, your choice."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "risk +3, +1 for usefulness."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "+3 Writing pose"

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 11 (6 4 1) vs. 9, failing by 2

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Going to do the +3, but I think I'll try to lead a diversion team to get up to 10 again. n.n"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "no pose, just someone else chucking lightning bolts in this battle."

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d6 for 10 (5 2 3)

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Lucky lucky n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Is it truly a diversion if we break through and kill them all? :D"

> (OOC) TidesGM haha. :) If you'd made a critical success, I might consider letting you pose that.

> (OOC) Nerai rolls 3d6 for 13 (6 6 1) vs. 10, failing by 3

Nerai looks around, and shakes her head. "These Human surrender no less than the dwarves assaulting their won home." She sighs. He turns to a Murloc, pulling the poor creature up by his head, and slicing the broadsword through his neck with one powerful stroke of her sword, rending the head from it's body. She looks at the poor creature throwing his head down, and shaking her head, "This is not our enemy." She states, as she calls among the troops, "No Quarter. Charge." As she pushes forward with her force of irregulars.

Saeren stays true to her original intent. She's going to be in the thick of it and make a fine target of herself. She charges ahead, leading a small contingent just crazy enough to follow her. The fire she rains down on the enemy doesn't look much like a diversion, and to the falling enemies it doesn't likely feel that way. But the defenses are deep, and for all the noise and fury, Saeren's charge is slowing swiftly.

> (OOC) Saeren is two for two on dumb luck! :D

> (OOC) Nerai's logic is that, while humans may not follow a goblin, they'll follow a barely functioning mass of steam and steel practically anywhere. :0

As Saeren's relentless assault drives a wedge into the naga front lines, Morley's strike team breaks through the undefended flank like a hot knife through butter. Nearly a third of the naga army is cut off, caught from either side and isolated from their allies. Several of the murlocs jump off the cliff in a panic, or throw down their spears in surrender. The naga are made of sterner stuff, and do not yield until they can fight no more.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Result: Allies inflict another 35% casualties, and take /none/ of their own. Your risk pays off and you are not subject to Misfortunes of War rolls."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Round 3 begins:"

As Morley and his team are overtaken by the advancing militiamen, he decides to take the initiative, take advantage of the massive casualties his troops have inflicted on the enemy, and drive recklessly up the hill toward the summit. Raising his staff in the air, he cries out, "Attack! All troops forward! Overrun them! FOR THE ALLIANCE!" If he notices Sookie flinch at this battle cry, he does not comment.

There are no answering cries from the naga lines. The fish-men and snake-women take what cover they can, and fight to the death for every inch of ground.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Mechanically: Morley adopted All-Out Attack; the naga adopted Desperate All-Out Defense."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Saeren is AFK for foodifying. Nerai and Sookie, declare/pose/roll; if Saeren isn't back by the time you're done, I'll pose in her place. All things considered, I'm going to assume a +3 Risk from her."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "+3 risk, +1 uselessness. here goes another fail!"

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 8 (2 2 4) vs. 9, succeeding by 1

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Or not"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "check it out now, the funk soul brother. o\_o"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Fatboyslim is fucking in heaven."

> (OOC) Nerai rolls 3d6 for 14 (6 2 6) vs. 10, failing by 4

"Shut up shut up SHUT UP!" shouts Sookie, to nobody in particular, and takes off. This time there's no cunning, no listening to plans. She has orders: defeat the naga. Fine. She simply swats naga into the air, casting them to their deaths on the rocks or the beach below, using the suspended and helpless victims to catch arrow volleys as they're launched before discarding them mercilessly.

Nerai watches the carnage around her. The Murlocs had a rally around their cause, and have returned in force, their magicians getting a few of the irregulars under Nerai's command.. She shutters, and sighs, her momentary lapse in defense allowing a few Murlocs to impotently latch onto Eecee and gnaw on it's steel armor, She mails her sword on the latches Murlocs, but it's not enough to save a few solders in her command, taken down by the hoarding swarm.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Saeren's roll:"

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 11 (3 6 2) vs. 10, failing by 1

The bowstring of Diplomacy sings its song of death, as Saeren continues her ferocious charge up the ramp. It seems there is only one thing that can stop her: a lack of ammunition. And thus the deadly archery of the night elves is stayed - not long enough to grant any respite to the servants of Dagun, but long enough to allow mere humans to catch up with her, at least.

Sookie's sudden burst of aggression is the straw that breaks the camel's back. Morley takes advantage of the stupendous death toll to drive forward an advance right through enemy lines. By high noon, Purgation Isle is once more in the hands of the Alliance.

The corpses of dead naga litter the aisle; no naga have surrendered, and only a small proportion of them were captured - that is to say, maybe one naga in five have survived the injuries that eventually incapacitated them. Rather more murlocs have surrendered; and the lost dwarven mortar company has been captured as well. Still trapped by the psychic enslavement of Dagun, the dwarves curse like only dwarves can at their captors, their eyes glowing with an uncanny hatred of the airbreathers that they would normally call allies.

Not one human died today. A handful were greivously wounded, but Kagarn and the human priests of Hillsbrad move along their ranks, patching their wounds and calling upon the Elements and the Light, respectively, to restore their bodies.

There is only one naga stronghold left unconquered - the Temple of Dagun itself. A brooding monstrosity of fresh-cut stone in a grotesque parody of ancient Highborne architecture, it lurks at the peak of the mountain. The naga leadership has holed up in there, and Morley is wary of it. Ironically, it is the almost complete lack of Allied casualties that fuels his reluctance to root them out; the narrow choke-point of the doorway, and the possibility of traps inside, make a frontal assault far more risky than on the open battlefield.

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Nuke it from Orbit. It's the only way to be sure."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Good point. Let me address that."

Some of Morley's war-mages argue for simply demolishing the structure, but face opposition from Kagarn. "This temple is the site where the naga create the chalices that enslaved your dwarven brethren. But if we can claim it intact, we can then cleanse the temple and use it to free not only the dwarves, but the naga you have captured."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Honestly, this kinda sounds like Saeren & Sookie's gig."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "We're in free-pose here. Feel free to ask questions either IC or OOC. We'll let Saeren return from food before proceeding."

Sookie stands off to one side, avoiding the Dalaran mages' field of vision as much as possible. But every so often she'll hop up, wave an arm frantically at Kagarn, then go back to skulking out of sight.

Nerai looks at her companions, the remains of Murlocs still agumenting Eecee's already intimidating apperance, "It seems like, if minimalizing casualities is the goal, that Saeren, or Sookie, or both, would be the answer here. A quick infiltration to eliminate most of the threat. One aslo assumes that we could just siege them for a week ot two, and drive them to surrender.

Morley rubs his chin. "A siege would be the most effective, perhaps, but something concerns me. The dwarves of Dun Garok may be able to break out of the mountain within a week's time. I would prefer to have a cure for their plight before then. And from what Kagarn tells me, we shall need this temple to accomplish that." He glances in the direction he'd last seen Sookie, though the woman is not visible now. "Your half-elemental friend may be able to cleanse a handful of dwarves, but she would be hard pressed to cleanse the entire keep by herself."

> (OOC) Sookie adds Morley to 'list of people to hurt, a lot'

> (OOC) Nerai says, "'People who aren't Kagarn' list?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Given he's a mage, I figure that's merely an upgrade from the mere 'people to hurt' list."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "there are several lists, with a fair amount of differentiation."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "The mere humans are on the 'people to hurt if they try to get between me any my cave' list, which is the baseline list."

> (OOC) Nerai figures we're basically duie a Saeren pose at this time.

> (OOC) Sookie is waiting for Kagarn to come away from dumb mages and talk n.n

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "We can handle that now."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Just cause they want to kill you, doesn't make them dumb, dear."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "they're dumb for thinking they have a chance."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "back!"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Go ahead and comment as you see fit, Saeren."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "At some point, Kagarn is going to go see what's on Sookie's mind."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Murdering us all in our sleep?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "that comes later!"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "For now, the oral sex! Okay, okay, posing.."

> (OOC) TidesGM wants to face the peril.

Saeren purses her lips, deep in thought. "I will shatter them," she says at last. "If there are to be more in my new family, that place must be taken, and taken whole." The archer stands tall, glaring towards the last stronghold. "How many do you figure are left there?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I figure the Dalaran mage lords have no clue what I'm blabbering about, but Kagarn and Nerai do. :D"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Sookie is a crazy bitch.. Therefore, awesome in bed."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Also, I have no clue how many are left."

"It's hard to be certain," says Morley. "The temple is warded against scrying. But it is unlikely to be more than a dozen, if they hope to hold out for more than a day."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "It was also not really built as a defensive fortification - no arrow slits in the outer walls, for example. Its defensive value is primarily in that its solitary door serves as a chokepoint."

"Very well." Saeren moves forward, "It's time to become the shadow." The great cat moves to join her, and the night elf begins to move towards her target, "This is going to be an operation of speed. I need to open that door one way or another," she muses aloud. "Kagarn!" she calls out abruptly, "I can destroy the front door safely, right?"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Protip: Choke Pointsd minimalize casualities. :)"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "One defender could hold off an army there! Provided he was armed with only the jawbone of an ass."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Destroy the what safely?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "And since Fandral is still alive..."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "shoot.. fixing.. the front door."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "If you have roaches on your ramp and they're trying to push with zealots... oh wait..."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Err, I can update ooc lines now? o.O"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Yes. Please be careful."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Ack. How do I find my last IC line?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "viewlast #20 or so"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "There we go."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Front door is what I want to have blowed up. Nerai may have just the thing I need n.n"

Kagarn nods to Saeren, rising to his feet. "The door is easily repaired - and indeed, we will need to replace the friezes of Dagun with more appropriate symbology in any case. But if you will excuse me, there is something I must first attend to."

Nerai looks over at Saeren, "Need something blown up?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "If all you need is a front door blowed up, you've got a dozen war-mages for that. but before we start..."

> (OOC) Nerai idles for kid rearing.

> (OOC) Sookie has plan. poses, in case things happen too fast for it to work n.n

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Actually, if you can hold off for a oment, Sookie."

> (OOC) Sookie does so

The tauren shaman makes his way through the impromptu siege lines already forming, nods to Sookie as he passes, and continues until he's behind a pillar of the old ruins that litter the mountaintop, out of sight of the Allied army. "Is something on your mind, Sookie?" asks Kagarn.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Go ahead with whatever you might have, Sookie."

"Na, goshi," the girl mutters, tapping her fingers together. "Naga proof against arrow earlier. How they do that? It feel like.. like.." She mumbles a few phrases in Kalimag, trying to convey her awareness of the spell. "If we do that, Saeren open door, I pull naga out, Saeren shut door. Have Nerai and scary furry thing near, kill anyone rush out after."

"I do not know how the naga did that," says Kagarn, grinning. "But if the men of Dalaran _also_ do not know, I think we should send them home to study some more. Come along - we should be able to make this quick."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "plan make sense, fellow players?"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "I dunno what scary furry thing is, but other than that, sure."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I beleive she means Shade."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "yes"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Ah so."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So, that works. :)"

Kagarn returns, and explains the plan to Morley. The war-mages do indeed have the ability to protect an individual from arrows and spears - the magic is not cheap enough to protect every common infantryman, but the mages themselves are thus defended, and it is a relatively simple matter for them to cast the spell upon Sookie, Saeren, and the other adventurers.

> (OOC) Saeren likes plans that keep a lot of naga alive. But still let us win :D

> (OOC) Sookie says, "k. gm, need anything else from us here?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Not really. At this point, I think I'm comfortable letting you pose through. I do have one suggestion though: let Nerai do the door-opening. You've got a heavily armored war machine here, let it do the most dangerous bit."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "k, good deal. Saeren can go skeet-shooting as naga fly past then. n.n"

> (OOC) Sookie pose briefly:

> (OOC) Saeren aims to cripple :D

Sookie flags down Saeren and Nerai, briefly explains her idea, then points at the mages. Spells are cast, incantations are muttered, and the adventurers creep back toward the temple.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Nerai, want to set us up? :)"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Okay"

Nerai waits for the mages to begin their perpetration. A few incantations and some handwaving later, the crew is outfitted with some anti missile spells. Nerai looks at Saeren and Sookie, then approaches the wall. The spell proves useful as a few errant missile flung haphazardly from the ramparts bounce ineffectually off Eecee's bulk. She grips the door in both hands, and opens the door, watching Sookie behind her as the Naga look out onto the battlefield, somewhat befuddled by the response.

As the door opens, Sookie's eyes scan quickly. She spots the best-dressed, most haughty-looking naga female she can, and grabs hold of her with her storm powers. Yanking the witch toward the door quickly, she starts moving out of the way.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "aaand Saeren/Shade :)"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Heh.. so can I pose them charging out freely, GM?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "What's actually going to happen... well, let me pose it."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "one's being telekinetically dragged. any that follow is up to GM"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Okay :) Letting GM go n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren needs to buy a power that puts uncurse ability in her arrows! :D

> (OOC) Nerai says, "EAT REDEMPTION, NAGA SCUM!"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "srsly you should get an artifact bow that shoots cleansing water arrows, yes"

As the naga - a priestess, by her robes - is hauled bodily from the temple, two naga myrmidons emerge from behind the door on their side, only to be confronted by Nerai in her steam armor. From inside, the irate voice of another, unseen female naga cries out in her native tongue, "Get back, you fools!"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "if I can yank those other two before the door closes, I'm fine with that. if it closes while one of them is halfway out, I'm fine with that too. n.n"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "You can yank one before they even know what's happening, and the other you can drag out by the tail as he's trying to retreat."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Can I hold it open, and the mages thusly nuke fools?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "got it. Saeren, gonna shoot the priestess that we caught? :)"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "GM, I intend to aim to disable, not to kill."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "So... you'll find that the priestess is protected by anti-missile spells as well. Discovering this will give her time to get off a frostbolt at you, which will similarly miss."

The flying priestess provides one of the easier targets that Saeren has seen recently. Skill is needed, however, to ensure that this one gets a chance at redemption. The archer shoots with care, seeking to injure her enemy, but not to kill. Following her shots with the same intent, the great cat leaps over Saeren towards the priestess, throwing its impressive bulk against the enemy even as the Naga counters Saeren's attacks. With all missile fire rendered useless, the great cat's power will decide the battle.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I figure that doesn't help at all against large, powerful night saber, right? :D"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Shade isn't a missle weapon."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Correct. There is no Deflect Nightsabers spell."

> (OOC) Sookie grabs myrms meanwhile.

While Saeren and her cat deal with the priestess, and before Nerai can shut off the other naga from protecting their fellows, Sookie's power grabs hold of the myrmidons who foolishly ran forward. One is seized bodily and tugged out like his mistress. The other is snagged by the tail, and spends its last few moments futilely clawing at the uncaring stone of the temple for as it's dragged out into the open.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "close door? :)"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "(and get to work on the guys out here)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "By the way, unrelated to the current scene - yes, this is a good time for Nerai to close the door - Kagarn has instructed the adventurers not to use Sookie's name in earshot of the Kirin Tor. Names have power, and they've got enough potential power over her as it is."

Nerai reads the sitation, and pushes Eecee's weight and strenght agains thte door, having trickles out a fiar number of Naga to start with.. She turns around, back to the door, and weilding her braodsword, daring the current combatants to approach.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So we're at.. 3 down so far? :P"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Can I pose taking down the priestess?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Sure. No one is going to surrender, but I see no reason why you shouldn't be able to subdue all of them - and gag the priestess."

The priestess could just give up, but instead, she struggles against the great cat, finally spinning away and raising her hands, clearly ready to let loose some kind of magic. Before she gets out so much as a word, the hilt of Saeren's sai comes crashing down on the naga's head, leaving the priestess crumpling to the ground.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Just to check, for my own satisfaction - is Sookie under specific orders not to make naga smoothies if she can subdue them without it?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "nobody's given me any such orders. she has some discretion here though"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "(since nobody's given me any more specific orders either)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Fair enough."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I think it's been made reasonably clear that her goshis prefer living prisoners."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Correct"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Where are we at this point? Who's got the two males?"

> (OOC) Sookie dragged em out. melee or whoever can engage them

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I was going to leave some fun for Nerai. Should I mop them up?"

> (OOC) Nerai was in guarding the door mode. c.c

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "It's up to you guys. They really don't stand a chance, it's just a question of who specifically they don't stand a chance."

> (OOC) Saeren takes it down.

With the priestess indisposed, Saeren and Shade direct their wrath at the myrmidons. With careful precision first one, then the other are rendered quite helpless. A short while later, Saeren has all three naga tied-up. Shade drags them away where waiting soldiers ensure the captives are kept safe.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Three down :D"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "lather rinse repeat, GM"

The second time Nerai opens the door, no naga are visible. Just the burning braziers mounted at regular intervals, illuminating the fluted support pillars and the disturbing friezes etched into the walls of the inner sanctum. A faint clunking of enchanted coral armor can be heard from further inside.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "And you know there's at least one more female in there."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "They can breed."

Sookie thinks a second. "You want live or die?" she calls out, yelling into the structure.

Nerai thinks, "I'm honestly not sure they actually care..."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Hmm.."

There is no response, except the voice of the naga they heard before, in Common: "Dagun take you, half-breed!"

"No visible enemies?" asks Saeren softly. She moves forward, staying behind Eecee as much as possible. If there's a shadow for her to fade into, she will find it.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Trying invis art, I guess :P"

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d6 for 10 (3 1 6) vs. 12, succeeding by 2

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sneaking into the door, then. Assuming there's no magic-fu against me."

Sookie notices herself no longer noticing Saeren, and guesses at what the elf is trying to do. Time for more distraction, then. "Dagun die trying!" she calls back defiantly. "Life or death. Pick before I get bored!"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So do I roll vs. stealth, now? :)"

As the naga and Sookie trade insults, Saeren slips inside, unnoticed - the burly myrmidons lurking by the door seem to see straight through her - and quickly finds a shadow to lurk in. The night elf cannot see the naga woman directly, but she can hear her voice above - and she can see a balcony overlooking the inner sanctum, all the way around the inner wall of the temple.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I took care of the relevant rolls."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "sweet."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'll be heading for the balcony, then. Is there a place there that I can hide on an edge from the myrmidons and also from the naga inside?"

The support pillars that were visible from the door continue all the way around the interior of the temple, spaced two yards apart. A ladder is carved into the stone halfway around one side, with a hatch leading to the balcony. No more naga are visible - although some sounds suggests a few may be lurking in the inner sanctum.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "So, the score is: you snuck by two myrmidons inside the door, you heard a naga female who is presumably lurking on the balcony above the door, and a few more naga may be lurking in the inner sanctum."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Hmm... okay, time to bag her."

Saeren moves slowly, carefully through her enemies. She knows the naga enough now to know that taking the female out will open things up. And give her own forces the distraction they need to plow right into the front door.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I figure I attack her, the naga all turn to nail me, and Sookie and Nerai and Shade come drop the hammer. n.n"

The art of invisibility that she learned in the warrens of the Undercity serves her well now. The naga witch, gripping the balcony with two of her four hands, is so intent on taunting Sookie, calling her for to come in and meet her doom, that she doesn't notice Saeren at all until the night elf is right on top of her.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Free pose? :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "...Sure. :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "As soon as the naga cries out, her myrmidons will come to her rescue - and become visible. There will be four in all, the two you saw, and two from the inner sanctum."

From the back, Saeren's strike comes in dead silence. She doesn't hold back. It's likely the enemy will survive her attacks, and between her friends the naga, there is little difficulty choosing. Her sai strike in rapid succession, stabbing the witch again and again, the fury relentless. "Your witch is mine, now, slaves of Dagun!" she cries.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "And now they will expose themselves to Sookie n.n"

> (OOC) Sookie covers her eyes and screams

> (OOC) Nerai says, "what are you, Japanese?"

> (OOC) Sookie yells "iiya!" and squeezes 50 gallons of blood out of them telekinetically.

> (OOC) Nerai says, "There you go"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So add mopping to the list of things we have to do to purify this place. You know. Post slaughter. n.n"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Nerai, Sookie, want to pose the mop-up of the myrmidons?"

> (OOC) Sookie handles 2 of em.

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Where are we that we can do this? They came out while I wasn't watching?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "You can charge in, cause they're gonna screw up and not watcht he door properly now."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "oic"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Yeah, they came out of hiding when Saeren snuck in and bagged their leader."

As one pair of myrmidons make a surprise appearance, Sookie grabs hold of them with her power. Lacking any better idea, she flings one across the temple and electrifies the other with a powerful charge of lightning.

At the pre-arranged signal, that is, the death screams of a Naga witch, Nerai charges in, sword drawn. The myrmidons on duty turn to realize that they're being charged, and haphazardly turn to encounter Nerai. She is waiting, however, and plunges her sword into the first's breast with one easy strike. She menaces the other, and swiftly subdues him as well, her eyes partially on Saeren doing her dirty work.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "'death creams' = sends the wrong message. plz edit"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "fizzed"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "This is naga we're talking about tho"

As with the larger battle, the fight for the Temple of Dagun ends, once again, with complete defeat for the naga. The one that Sookie electrocuted is beyond saving, but Kagarn is able to stabilize the others, including Saeren's final victim.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "All the king's horses and all the king's man, can't undo Sookie's dirty work."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "You Win - for today. :) Shall we have some kind of wrap-up?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "yes plz."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "And after this, we have time for heavy training? :P"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Yes, certainly."

> (OOC) Saeren wants to know if the last witch accepts the drink, too :D

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I mean, I stabbed her especially nice and all n.n"

> (OOC) Sookie has pose for followup as well

> (OOC) TidesGM hee

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Four of the six myrmidons you captured just now will become lamia, as will the last witch you stabbed. The priestess will try the chalice but remain a naga."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "As the saying goes, once you stay naga... I pretty much slit your throat in the shadows and leave you for dead."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone who has poses, please go ahead."

> (OOC) Nerai is good at this point.

While the forces from Southshore are busy, Sookie has a mission. She borrows a knife and goes off hunting for corpses. It'll end up taking her most of the night and a good chunk of tomorrow, but she has a mission now: nagahide boots for Henry Maleb, magistrate of Southshore. It's not a chair, but any naga that comes out of the surf to see the man wearing them will think twice before tackling Southshore again.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "That's really warped n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Oh, speaking of which.. do we get paid for this win? :D I'm so evil."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Can we get a start-to-purify pose? :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Who's the goblin here again? :D Seriously, though, you guys get paid in a share of the loot. \*scribble\* about $50K."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Each, or total? :D"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "If you want, I can start with the purification poses."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Total. :p"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "goferit"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Go for it. :)"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Nerai is the goblin, I'm just looking to further outfit myself with top of the line means of delivering death n.n"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "split it three ways. Sookie's got no truck with this strange useless metal people are passing out."

The mages of Dalaran and Kagarn Stormhoof both have copies of Ezra's notes on creating counter-chalices. The priests of the Hillsbrad Foothills find them confusing at first, but with Kagarn's own experience to supplement them, they soon have a plan to proceed. It is generally agreed that the reborn temple will be consecrated to the Light.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Ezra's notes: 'under no circumstances consecrate anything to the Light.'"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "'I mean it will work and stuff, but I got an image to uphold here.'"

Stonemasons begin carefully chiseling away the murals of sea creatures and tentacled monstrosities, while other laborers thoroughly clean the filth from the floors and walls. The bloodstained altar at the head of the inner sanctum is lifted bodily from its place and hurled down the mountainside.

And all the while, the priests and priestesses stand at all corners, forswearing food and drink, offering nonstop prayers to the Light, pausing only to spell each other. By degrees, the oppressive, sea-rank air of the temple begins to clear, as the influences of the dark Old God are systematically purged.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Also, phbbt to Ezra. n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Just so long as they don't screw up these new Lamia with this 'light' stuff. We work for Elune."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Any powerful Eternal or force for good can offer the lamia freedom, but once freed, they can choose for themselves where to place their allegiance."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. Who has more?"

> (OOC) Sookie will be cowering in fear from Dalaran guys during this, once boots are done

> (OOC) Saeren just got great idea from Bill n.n

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Well, as long as they are happy, that works n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren poses.. something.

Watching the cursed place be transformed into a home of the light brings a smile to Saeren's face. "It's.. not exactly the way I had envisioned it," she says to Shade. "In most ways, it is better. From this place, we can save the dwarves and countless others. We have turned the weapon of Dagun into the undoing of the curse." And in murmuring this, the Night Elf seems to get an idea. "A weapon to undo the curse," she muses aloud. "A weapon to be turned against Dagun's cursed, in their own realm."

> (OOC) Sookie has nothin else.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "In that case, I shall wrap up."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Woot :)"

On the morning of the second day after the capture of the temple, a goldsmith from Hillsbrad is called in, with his tools and his supplies. And by noon, Lord Morley emerges, flanked by the goldsmith and the priests. "Behold," he calls. "A Chalice of the Light - the salvation of Dun Garok!" The army cheers - but the loudest cheer comes from the dwarven mortar company - and from the lamia, for whom this temple will be the foundation of their fledgling community.
