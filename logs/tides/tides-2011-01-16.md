Ezra's journey to Sunsail Anchorage is uneventful. A series of teleports, performed from mountaintop to distant mountaintop, have kept him safe from the lesser varieties of undead roaming the Ghostlands. Likewise, the skulking beasts and feral wildlife of the once-beautiful woodlands are few and far between at such altitudes.

This high vantage point affords him something else: early intelligence as to the state of the anchorage itself. The harbor has fallen under attack, although the wizard can't yet tell from where or by whom. But the nearby murloc village suggests an obvious set of culprits.

He locates a nearby settlement by spotting for the tall spires the blood elves seem so fond of constructing, presents himself to the guard, and is duly escorted before Magistrix Landra Dawnstrider.

What this worthy has to say comes as a surprise. "The murlocs have been peaceful, keeping to themselves," Magistrix Dawnstrider reports after learning his identity. "No, it's the Wretched we've had trouble with. My scouts report that the survivors of the attack have set up a fortified camp east of the anchorage. All our rangers are still securing the eastern perimeter, so I haven't been able to muster a force strong enough to dislodge the Wretched. If you're here to help, go there."

Ezra thinks a moment, then tips his hat politely. "I will ssee to it, Magistrix," he wheezes.

Velendris Whitemorn held authority over Sunsail Anchorage. Now he is reduced to directing his men in the digging of graves for two Wretched. As Ezra draws near, he signals for them to continue, and waves off a pair of archers who stand ready with arrows nocked. "You're from Tranquillien?" he demands.

"Not... exactly, no." Ezra examines the camp - little more than a few tents, some scavenged supplies, bloodied weapons and armor laying about, and a makeshift hospital for the treatment of the survivors. It's ringed with wooden spikes - nothing that would stand up to a determined and professional assault, but enough to hold back these 'Wretched'. Ezra remembers them well: blood elves whose addiction to magic has gone too far. He thinks now of the Broken denizens he met in the Exodar, and smiles inwardly.

"Then why are you here?" the elf demands. The wizard bows in return: "I undersstand you have a .. problem. I am here to ssolve it, yess." This incites snickers or grumbling from some of the other elves, but Whitemorn silences them with a flick of his hand. "Fine. They have most of our good weapons, we were run out with whatever was at hand. Their leader is named Aldaron the Reckless, we're pretty sure he's at the top of the tower. Kill him and the others should be easy enough to pick off."

Things are rarely as they seem. Ezra has no need to breathe, so he decides to approach by way of the riverbottom. _What are the Wretched here for?_ he asks himself, remembering his previous time in the Ghostlands. _Magic. To sate their addiction. What here is magical?_

The sunken ships yield the answer. _Cargo_. Ezra swims closer.

The wizard spends several minutes surveying the wrecks. At least one of the ships he concludes is a pirate: streamlined, lacking the internal appointments that signal a disciplined military vessel, but also bearing heavy armaments and signs of past combat. Cannon fire has gouged the hull and been patched over with newer wood; some of the rigging shows signs of splicing; and a stash of firearms belowdecks all testify to regular battle.

What's in the hold answers his question conclusively. It's half full with artifacts which immediately register as magical to his wizard's senses, and a few carefully cast spells show that almost everything here contains at least some magic to it.

There's something else. Ezra misses it at first, but these items are a mixture of elven artifacts and strangely organic carvings of coral and the like. Pirates preying on their own people is nothing new, but the elven pieces are old items. Incredibly old, in fact. And the rest bear the unmistakeable imprint of underwater construction. _Naga,_ Ezra thinks to himself.

The Forsaken finds that his presence as a magician is detectable by the Wretched who are still patrolling the Anchorage; he escapes from one patrol only to be nearly ambushed by another, and diving deep to swim for it is his escape. As dusk falls, he emerges dripping wet from the river and flies silently up the side of the tower - now satisfied that the patrols have lost him.

Aldaron the Reckless is cunning, and his men seem to share that quality. Ezra finds them waiting for him at the top. Frost Nova is enough to injure the guards; with other spells and a careful use of air magic, Ezra sends one of the bodyguards falling soundlessly to the river below; a faint splash is all that marks his meeting with the water. The other one assaults the wizard's shadow images, opening himself up to a counterattack, and falls unconscious and charred by a burst of fire.

As Ezra wheels to confront Aldaron himself, the ringleader throws down his scimitar and holds up his hands. "Stop! I know you," he shouts. Ezra hesitates; it could be a trick. Still, he's willing to see where this goes.

"You're Ezra. One of the men on patrol recognized you," explains Aldaron. "He wasn't always Wretched. I've heard the stories about your naga-hunting friends. Spare my life, let me take a bit of this cargo with me, and I'll tell you something interesting."

Ezra draws back. "Sspeak then."

"That ship in the harbor is stacked with magical supplies," Aldaron explains. "That's why we jumped it. They sail in here and offload their cargo, only it then gets carted off to Silvermoon City. Kael'thas did a deal with the naga. We get supplies of magic to satisfy ourselves, and we help the naga with some plan or other, something that requires overland travel."

"We don't care about such things, so we raided it. But if Velendris is sending wizard-assassins after me, the stakes are getting too high, so I don't mind getting out. If you need proof, you'll find the murlocs west of here in possession of Captain Kelisendra's navigation maps. They're marked with the safe areas the naga have mapped out for us."

Ezra digests this carefully. "Go then," he says finally. "I will sseek you out again. Not to kill you - but perhapss I can cure you of thiss addiction you bear, in time."

Aldaron wastes no time. Throwing a few possessions into a sack, he races down the tower. Ezra, too, feels no need to stay where he is.

The Dead Scar is a blight on the otherwise-beautiful forest. Many undead are still to be found there: the reanimated remains of the Scourge's victims, wandering about mindlessly in the absence of leadership. While the Lich King sleeps, he seems content to permit them to aimlessly murder the occasional unwary traveler.

One area of the Dead Scar, though, has been cleared through the diligence of Silvermoon's rangers: that separating the two halves of the road leading south. And at the start of that road, in tent camps outside the city walls, Ezra meets the pilgrims.

They are would-be travelers, encountered singly or in small groups around the camp. They have wagons and supplies, and for now seem to be engaged in fishing and hunting to provision themselves. Ezra speaks cordially to several of them. All have the quality of desperate hope about them, speaking of the "promised land" or "salvation" to be found to the south - a set of promises from their leaders which Ezra finds unwholesomely vague.

Still, their feelings are genuine. They laugh and chat with each other, they cry at times they think nobody is looking, they watch over their children with a feirce protectiveness. In a world where security is found behind walls and bought with the blood of soldiers, these civilians seem prepared to risk everything on a long and questionable journey.

Here and there, Ezra can make out blood elves wearing heavy armor. Their tabard is something new to him, perhaps some new order within the Silvermoon military. But when he approaches them, he feels a faint and unfamiliar stirring of feelings: recognition mixed with revulsion. He can't yet place a finger on it, but he files it away for later.

The pilgrims seem to have a leader. A blood elf is speaking to the pilgrims at the gate, eliciting friendly approval from his audience. Ezra whispers an inquiry, and learns from one of the listeners that this is Martik Tor'seldori.

"Brothers and sisters!" Martik calls. "I have been to the promised land. I have tasted the sublime energy. I have felt bliss - bliss so engrossing and all-encompassing that I was left wondering if I had stumbled upon the dreams of the gods."

A few of the pilgrims cry out ecstatically, and others urge him to continue. "In paradise, you merely reach out and take bliss from the Nether." From the audience, one elf calls: "but how?"

Martik grins. "From the very air! Tendrils of arcane energy light up the obsidian sky as plumes of raw magic rise up from fissures in the land. Kneel and drink from the fissures as you do from a stream or well. Pluck a tendril from the heavens as if it were an apple hanging from a branch."

Ezra has heard enough. The extent of the elves' arrangement with the naga goes further than he'd feared. The Darnassian sentinels sent to spy on the blood elves are looking in the wrong place. The pilgrimage must be the key - and Ezra remembers very well just how it was that he infiltrated Scarlet Monastery.

Turning, he strides off into the forest. It's time to make a report.
