The inhabitants of Southshore were happy to see the Defiant and its passengers deal with the naga invasion. Truth be told, they aren't really sad to see them go either: dangerous people are, well, dangerous.

The wizards of Dalaran, and the dwarves of Dun Garok, have written letters of introduction from their respective strongholds. Signed and sealed, these letters are entrusted to Kagarn for delivery to Ironforge.

Going through the paperwork that the party has amassed, Kagarn finds one more document of interest to the dwarves. Ezra left behind pronounciation notes on spoken Titan, something that few living beings on Azeroth can claim to know much about.

---

The rising sun reflects itself over the crystalline engine the Defiant uses for power, painting a montage of shimmer over the gas bag. The crew's food and water supplies are refreshed. As they lift off, a few shouts and waves follow them from the Southshore dock. What lies beyond is the Great Ocean.

The cliffs to the east give way to the gap in the continent, within which lies the Thandol Span of the Dwarves. From there, the terrain changes from the mountains and hills of the north to a low, marshy no-mans-land simply called the Wetlands. The Alliance is known to have a few outposts here, including the port town of Menethil Harbor, while further east broods the abandoned stronghold of Grim Batol.

Navigating the high, cold mountains of Dun Morogh proves a challenge; the airship's engines, magical though they be, are still based on goblin principles, and those principles consist of heat, fire and explosion in some state of controllability. Nor do the high winds prove helpful.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Y'know, there's a pretty obvious place to land a flying vessel bound for Ironforge. n.n"

As Defiant crests the mountains, though, those on deck suddenly spot an airstrip. Dwarven air-planes are lined up along a paved strip. Further south, there's gunfire and other sounds of conflict, but it seems that Ironforge has established a safe zone here. A decision is made: land here.

As the airship approaches, a trio of flying machines buzzes them, and an amplified gnomish voice calls out: "Attention Defiant. Please proceed to landing pad 3, marked with green flares." The indicated landing site is easy enough to see, as are the gnomes waving glowing torches and guiding the Defiant to a safe landing.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "those aren't flares, those are TNT sticks!"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "This isn't a goblin landing strip, Sookie."

The small party that greets the adventurers consists mostly of dwarves, bundled against the chill winds that blow through the leveled ground of the airstrip. "Welcome ta Ironforge," he says gruffly, not sounding very welcoming at all. "Ye'd better come inside. This ain't no place for a decent conversation."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Fortunately we're not decent people."

Nerai looks at the Dwarf, "Indeed." She says, looking back to her companions.

> (OOC) Nerai says, "I think Sookie should talk to them. Dwarves like Humans, right?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Nerai's been to Ironforge before? While apprenticed to Rolf?"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Indeed."

Saeren has grown accustomed to such greetings. Actually, in retrospect, this is one of the better welcomes they've had lately. "Decent conversation sounds good," Saeren agrees. Shade looks at the dwarves, sniffing curiously and says nothing.

> (OOC) Sookie issa follow along.

An archway leads from the airstrip to a hallway further down into Ironforge proper. Nerai remembers the surprisingly warm air and the distant sound of hammering - both of which are products of the Great Forge, where the dwarves have harnessed the very blood of the mountain as a source of heat and light for their endless industrial pursuits.

The Great Forge itself, though, does not seem to be part of the tour today, as they are instead led to a small building, labeled "CUSTOMS" in dwarvish runes. The dwarf that greeted them introduces himself. "I'm Crag Steelhammer, aide to Senator Redstone. We had word of ye from Dalaran. And while we're right grateful fer what ye did for Dun Garok, we have ta wonder - what business do ye have _here_?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Whoever fancies themselves a leader may feel free to explain. If no one wishes, Kagarn will take over."

> (OOC) Nerai will goes

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Good idea, I'm only a leader in nigh elf lands. n.n Elsewhere I'm basically a psycho. :D"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "That's a shame, because to Alliance eyes you're the friendliest face in the party (other than Sookie, whose temperament is even less amenable to leadership than yours :)"

Nerai steps forward and begins, "I am Nerai Escapement, and I have to say it is nice to be in Ironforge again. We bring urgent news of a growing problem faced by all peoples. We humbly ask leave to speak to the King of these matters. While they are not secret, we have run into.. complications in the past."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Yes, but I'm the home towm girl!"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'll speak if it seems necessary :D"

The dwarf narrows his eyes and peers at Nerai. "Ye've been in Ironforge, ye say. Where've I heard that name before..." he muses, stroking his beard, then shakes his head. "Well, I have to tell ye, lass, the King's audience comes pretty dear these days. He's pretty busy dealin' with the Dark Iron threat. Ye may have noticed half a bridge when ye were flyin' in from Dun Garok, f'rinstance."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "anyone typing?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "My turn."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I think, anyway."

> (OOC) Nerai is posing too.

"Of course." She says, nodding curtly. Nerai thinks for a moment, "We, clearly, would not have come such a long way to warn of impending threats to everyone if the need and threat were not urgent." She pauses, "But we do understand how things go, and of course do not expect The King to drop everything to attend to us." She looks at Crag. "How does one get an audience, anyway?"

> (OOC) TidesGM hopes he didn't stomp on anything.

"Now ye can tell _me_ what's on yer mind," says Steelhammer, "or ye can tell Senator Redstone in person next week. Or if ye _really_ have yer heart set on the King himself... eh... about a month. Maybe more, if somethin' comes up."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "You can just swap."

> (OOC) Saeren poses.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "how do I get backlog with line numbers? with OOC I'm no longer sure what line numbers are what"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "viewlast #"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "the literal '#', not just a number. you can append a number of lines as well"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "got it. Saeren's next"

Saeren says, "It seems once again we arrive just in time." The night elf steps forward, "I am Saeren, and I wish the threat we speak of was so small a matter that it could wait a month. I do not know if news has reached here of what happened at Dun Garok. The menace we speak of has almost certainly allied itself with your enemies already, the better to destroy you."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Meaning the real details. Not just 'saved dorfs', of course."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "My pose, or GM? ^^"

Steelhammer hrms. "With all due respect to our good lads in Dun Garok, they're a long way from home, and our homelands are under siege. It seems like a week don't go by without us dealin' with a Dark Iron plot to blow up the Stonewrought Dam, f'rinstance." The dwarf lowers his voice. "And there are rumors the Dark Irons have struck e'en closer ta home than that."

"They want to blow the dam?" asks Saeren. The night elf narrows her eyes, "What would happen if that dam were destroyed?"

"Loch Modan is... what do the humans call it... tha 'breadbasket' of Khaz Modan. Though mostly it's a fish basket. A lot of our food comes from there. An' then there's the mills and engines driven by the great turbines under the dam. It'd be a severe blow."

Sookie has been skulking about, using Kagarn's bulk as a shield from prying eyes. Now she elbows him gently. "Na, goshi, Dark Irons. They summon Ragnaros, right?"

> (OOC) TidesGM swaps.

"My concern, sir, is that the naga are guiding your enemies already," says Saeren. "Is this level of Dark Iron activity unusual?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I just said sir! I am so gonna insult him behind his back later."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Saeren seems like the type who uses sir AS an insult."

Steelbeard's eyes flare, and his expression hardens. "Ye've heard that story, have ye, lass. Aye, it was that thrice-cursed sorceror Thaurissan who summoned the Firelord, in his madness. Destroyed the Redridge Mountains, it did. A great blow to dwarf and human alike." He rubs his beard, addressing Saeren. "Unusual? Mebbe a bit more than usual. They've been harassing us fer longer than a lot o' humans have been alive, but blowin' half the Thandol Span, that's pretty recent, sure."

Sookie peeks out at Steelbeard warily. "Dark Iron not like you. They speak different," she says quietly. "They live under mountain too. Clan send people there, many year ago."

"The naga would love to see as much of your lands under water as possible," says Saeren. She looks to Sookie, "And others, perhaps, as well."

> (OOC) Saeren must afk.. to whip cream quickly ^^;;

"Blackrock Mountain, aye," Steelbeard begins, then grows quiet, waving Saeren to silence. "Which clan is this, lass? What do ye know of the Dark Irons?"

Still using Kagarn as a barrier, Sookie sticks a hand out. Quickly she traces the distinctive T-shaped outline of the Twilight's Hammer flag.

"The Twilight's Hammer?" asks Steelbeard. "Weren't they an orc clan? What does a human like ye have to do wi' _them_? Aye, we've heard that the orcs set themselves up in the upper reaches o' Blackrock Mountain, but by all reports they dinna get along with the Dark Irons."

Sookie shrugs. "Is not orcs. Clan take all people now. Dwarves too. Dark Iron dwarves. Light Iron dwarves. Whatever."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone else going to step in? Because Kagarn will make the connection I'm looking for here, otherwise."

> (OOC) Nerai dunno what you're looking for.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone interested could roll Diplomacy, if you want a hint."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Sookie has no clue n.n"

> (OOC) Nerai rolls 3d6 for 6 (2 1 3)

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Nerai might know."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "at 12"

Nerai watches as Saeren and Sookie work on Crag. She finally speaks up, "As my night elf friend was implying, there's a good chance that your problem, that is the Dark irons, and our problems, that being the coming Naga plague or infestation, are indeed allied. I would not be surprised if the Naga have already started inducting some of your foes into their shambling, mindless masses." She shakes her head, "If this is the case, it is even more urgent that we find some way to pacify them."

Steelbeard stares at Nerai contemplatively. "The Dark Irons are deadly foes enough by themselves. If they've sought even more allies against us..." He shakes his head. "But I dunno if I dare just take ye at yer word. We'll need better proof than that, if ye want to convince us that the Dark Irons are working with these naga of yers."

"Sometimes it is as simple as examining the bodies of your foes. Have you noticed strange growths around their necks or ears? Gills, mainly." Nerai rambles a bit, "In any case, I'm sure we could find evidence of what is suspected, given a decent chance."

> (OOC) Sookie dun have anything else to add here, wants to see what dwarves do

Crag Steelbeard eyes the group contemplatively. "Well... if ye brought us information about what the Dark Irons were up to, I guarantee _that_ would get you an audience with the King right quick. An' if ye can bring proof that the naga are workin' with 'em while yer about it, ye'll have what ye're lookin for."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Also it'll make the question mark on top of my head go away."

Sookie nudges Kagarn again. "Na, goshi. Go to mountain then. Clan definitely there. Worship Ragnaros."

Nerai nods, "Alright. We'll see if we can figure out what they're up too." Nerai nods, and then looks to Sookie, "And hopefully we'll find them again too, ne?"

Kagarn rubs his horn in thought. "I think the dwarves may also want evidence that the Twilight's Hammer is working with the naga." He addresses Steelbeard. "Send messages to Moonglade. The night elves can tell you of the battle for Blackfathom Deeps, and the Twilight's Hammer-naga alliance they faced there." Steelbeard nods.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone have anything else at the moment?"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Nope"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. Then a fair bit more from me."

The dwarf looks the group over. "Well, ye've been travelin' for a few days. Spend the night in Ironforge. I'll see if I can get ye the latest intelligence on the dwarven lands under Blackrock Mountain. We dinna know much, but the more ye know, the better yer chances of gettin' in. And gettin' back out alive."

Nerai nods to Crag, "Anything that you can tell us about them would be much appriciated. Anything about their attempt on the dam would be very useful."

"Well, Nerai," replies Steelbeard. "Ye know yer way around Ironforge, or so ye said. I'm sure ye can find a good in fer ye and yer friends. Just send a message to the forge, care o' the office of Senator Redstone, so we know where ye're stayin. We'll meet again in the mornin'."

---

However, it is only early in the evening, by the gongs of Ironforge, when Crag Steelbeard arrives at Firebrew's Inn, asking for Nerai.

Nerai heads down the stairs as the message is delivered, and she smiles at Crag, "Yes?" SHe asks, and then points to a table, "Have a beer with me?"

"I knew I'd heard yer name afore," he says to the goblin, looking grim, though he accepts the pint gratefully. "Ye were 'prenticed to Rolf Drakfeuer, weren't ye? Why did ye leave?"

Nerai gasps as she hears, the name, and when looks aroudn the bar. "Yes. I was Rolf's student." She pauses for a time, taking a drink of her own pint, "They came after me." She says, cryptically.

"The Dark Irons came after ye too?" Crag says.

> (OOC) Nerai says, "One track mind much? :D"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Hee. You'll see."

Nerai continues, "My clan. They, well, I wasn't exactly supposed to .. STAY apprenticed to Rolf, you might say." She takes another drink. "My clan, and really, most of my people, always try and do things the quick and easy way." Nerai shrugs, "I felt bad. I would have felt worse if anything had happened to Rolf, or his workshop. Or anything, really." She shakes her head.

Crag goes very quiet. "I was just asking," he says softly, "because it was the Dark Irons that came after Rolf."

Nerai raises an eyebrow, "Oh?" She looks at her beer, "That... I... I never knew..."

"Ye wouldn't have known," says Crag. "It were only a few months ago. I guess Rolf's steam armor designs were famous with more than just yer clan. So... I just wanted ta let ye know ta be on the lookout fer him. Yer the best chance he has, right now."

Nerai nods, and down the rest of her beer, "Aye, I will." She says. Then remains silent, staring at the empty tankard. "Thanks, Crag."

"Sorry ta spoil yer ale, Nerai," says Crag. "Rolf had a lot o' good things ta say about ye. I hope ye find him."

Nerai shrugs, "I had hoped to find him too. I'm not sure I have any, now."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Any what?"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Hope!"

"Where there's life, there's hope, lass," says Crag. "Old dwarven sayin', me dad taught me. 'And need of vittles', as he liked ta add. Besides, ye seem like ye've learned a lot since ye were Rolf's apprentice. If anyone can get him free from the Dark Irons, it's ye."

"I've certainly been around the world, as Rolf used to say he had. Through I think it applies more literealyl in my case." Nerai shakes her head, "War council in the morning then, one assumes?" She pauses, "Or something akin to that."

Crag nods. "I'll get ye everything we know about what happened ta Rolf, too.""

Nerai nods, "That would be.. appriciated..."

---

The next day, Crag returns with maps and books. "Only a few have ever escaped from Blackrock Depths, and fewer still were able to say anything coherent about their experience. Most of what we've learned of the place is from the Thorium Brotherhood, and frankly, we don't trust them much more than we trust any other Dark Irons."

Nerai has spent the night in fitful sleep, and looks somewhat tired and bothered at the council. "Sometimes trust is needed." Nerai pours over the maps, and reads and traces with her finger, "Mostly what we would need to know are underground sources of sea water."

"One thing we _do_ know is that black dragons have been sighted flying around the base of Blackrock Mountain. Approaching too close to the place by air is a good way to be shot down." Crag continues, laying out maps of the surrounding area on the table. "The Thoriums have an outpost here. We'll send word that we're sending more allies against Thaurissan. That should be good enough forthem." He strokes his beard. "Seawater, eh? I'd not think the sea goes anywhere near there, but let me send word to Tinkertown. The Deeprun Tram doesn't go too far from there - they might know if there's any seawater nearby."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Any more questions?"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "That's all I really know to ask."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Fair enough."

The gnomes report that the Deeprun Tram's route passes under a natural bay between Dun Morogh and Elwynn. They gave Blackrock Mountain a wide berth, for obvious reasons, but the bay goes far enough inland that it's less than a day's journey from the foothills of the mountain.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "And that question answered. If it comes up, you'll hear about it later. n.n"

> (OOC) Nerai laughs.

The wind is calm over Ironforge Airport - perfect weather for an airship launch. Crag escorts the adventurers back to the Defiant. "Good luck, friends."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Any closing poses?"

> (OOC) Nerai is going to put something in

Nerai shakes her head, grim determination spread across her face. "We will return. Hopefully with everything we seek." She walks back to the cabin of the Airship, and revs the engines up, ready to push off and face the new danger.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone else?"

> (OOC) Sookie got nothin! just point me at the bad guys

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "In that case, I like this as a closing pose."
