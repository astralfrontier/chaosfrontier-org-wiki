# Turning Tides 2011-02-13

> (OOC) Log "Tides-2011-02-13" started by TidesGM at Sun Feb 13 17:52:16 2011 CST (OOC)

Just south of Dun Morogh, between the home of the dwarves and the perilous Blackrock Mountain, there is a deep cleft in the earth, partly natural and partly the result of an open pit mine dug by the Dark Iron Dwarves. The land was once part of the peaceful foothills of the Redridge Mountains. Now, like all other lands beneath the shoulder of Blackrock, it is a desolate wasteland marred with pools of lava and crawling with such life as can survive in this shadow of the Elemental Firelands.

The updrafts from from this land, dubbed the Searing Gorge by those handful of Dark Iron dwarves that call it home, make for a challenging ride for the Defiant. Nevertheless, Nerai's skill at the helm is more than equal to the task, and soon the rickety iron spires of Thorium Point come into view.

The adventurers are greeted by a grim, darkskinned dwarf in burnished reddish armor, who calls himself Overseer Oilfist. "So yer the fools who think ye want to go _into_ the prisons of Blackrock, are ye?" he says. "Bunch of daft morons, if ye ask me."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Yer welcome, I mean, you're welcome to respond."

> (OOC) Saeren does so.

Saeren grins at the welcome. "We never go where we want to. We do this because we must." She looks to the others, "And being greeted as daft morons is actually a pretty big improvement compared to our normal, isn't it Nerai?"

Nerai shrugs, "Warmer welcome than we got from some folk, if my memory serves. Besides, there's work to be done inside of there." She nods at Saeren, "Probably not the worst yet, either." She shrugs, "So, are you the one who can tell us about it?"

Oilfist rolls his eyes. "I suppose," he says. "But what's in it fer me?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "more"

Kagarn looks Oilfist in the eye and says levelly, "You are of the Dark Iron clan yourself," he says. "The tales tell that you led your people out of the Mountain in protest of the Sorceror-Thane's rule. You know best what is under the Mountain; if _you_ tell _us_ what is in it for you, we shall endeavor to provide it."

> (OOC) Nerai needs to idle for dinner, should be back pretty soon.

Oilfist holds Kagarn's gaze, then gives a brief nod. "Fine, fine. What's in it for _us_ is one of our craftsmen. Balthar Forgewright, brother of the dwarf who built the citadel of Shadowforge. Clever man with his hands, but he dinna know when ta keep his mouth shut. If yer breakin anyone outta there, he comes along too."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "unless you wish to comment, I'll continue on."

> (OOC) Sookie has nothing, but is wearing 'I <3 Elementals' t-shirt.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "more seriously, findin out about the nearby TH encampment should happen here"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK."

Oilfist leads the adventurers to a small tent beside the airship tower, where maps of Blackrock Mountain are spread out. "So what's this Twilight Hammer we heard tell of from them soft-skins in Ironforge? They said that's what _yer_ after in there, apart from a friend o' yers."

> (OOC) Sookie on this.

Sookie explains. "Twilight's Hammer is clan. Orc clan. Now take all people. Dwarf, orc, human. Worship Old Gods and elemental lords, like Ragnaros. Want power from gods and elementals. If Dark Iron call Ragnaros from Firelands, clan definitely here."

Oilfist's eyes flare at the mention of Ragnaros. "Well, why didn't ye say so in the first place?" he growls. "Any friend of the Firelord is an enemy of ours!" He rubs his chin. "Wait a minute... Twilight's _Hammer_, ye say...?" He turns to a nearby chest and rummages in it. "D'ye recognize _this_ symbol, then?" he asks, slapping down a piece of torn violet cloth, bearing a familiar thorned-hammer crest.

Sookie nods calmly. "That clan symbol. Where you get?"

Oilfist jerks his head to the west. "Bunch of crazies lurkin' in the hills and caves over yonder. We been harassin' em on general principles, on account o' anyone who worships fire elementals in these parts ain't no friend of ours, but we figured they were just a bunch o' crazies. All sorts o' races, even a few of his kind," Oilfist adds, nodding in Kagarn's direction.

"It just goes to show that stupidity isn't exclusive anymore," says Saeren. "Looks like we found our first target, anyway."

Sookie thinks for a moment, then pipes up. "Na, goshi. Kill clan. Take clothes. Sneak into mountain. I teach you clan ways."

Kagarn rubs his horn contemplatively. "Emulate one of the Twilight's Hammer, then? That is a possibility." He turns to Oilfist. "Has the Twilight's Hammer encampment had much contact with the Blackrock dwarves?"

> (OOC) Nerai returns.

Oilfist waggles a hand. "A few," he says. "It's not like Thaurissan's sent his army ta help out or anythin'. But it's hard ta keep track of them. They're a buncha paranoid maniacs, an' they're pretty good at coverin' their tracks."

Nerai pipes back up, "Maybe they have another wqay into the mountain in tehir cave, too. Would make them harder to track."

"We could always find out the hard way," suggests Saeren. "With proper motivation, I'm sure one of them might tell us."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "sounds like we have a plan. let's execute :)"

---

> (OOC) Saeren says, "In more ways than one. :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. So what's the /immediate/ objective? I'm perfectly happy to not run full-fledged combat unless people want it. n.n"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "In a normal buddy cop movie this would be where Nerai and Saeren have an argument abou ttorture."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Exactly."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "I think just what Sookie said. Get some clothes, sneak in."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Find th, abduct soem TH, taek clothes, sneak ins."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Okiedoke. Finding the cave Oilfist talked about is not a problem, and go far enough in and you find Twilights. How many volunteers do I have to help pose that part?"

> (OOC) Sookie !

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm in for it, since I'm going to be the sneak."

> (OOC) Nerai kind of assumed Saeren would do the actual sneaking in

> (OOC) Saeren is also the slightly bad cop, nerai the good cop, and sookie the cop that kills you and wonders what the big deal is.

> (OOC) Sookie goes back in her box then.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm counting on Sookie to terrify these asshats. That being said, Sookie's elemental nature could be very persuasive here."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Sookie could be like.. 'Hey baby, wanna control my elemental?'"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I was kinda thinking that she'd pose as some kind of high up elemental and demand they tell us whatever we want."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "And barring that, she could just fry them slowly to death."

> (OOC) Sookie can't really do that well. ^\_^; death is better.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "You guys can either sneak in and steal clothes, or you can barge in and blast your way to the first tauren who looks to be Kagarn's size. Pick one, or agree on an alternative. :)"

> (OOC) Sookie votes sneak

> (OOC) Nerai second.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Darn, outvoted. Okay, I steal n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "This is probably a better idea, anyway :D"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Take it away, Saeren."

The broken lands around Blackrock provide hiding places that even the most simple novice could easily use. For one with such skills honed to the degree that Saeren has, it is as good as being invisible. She weaves her way to the cave, taking the measure of her adversaries. They are so obvious that she knows their number without the slightest risk to herself.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "more more"

Getting closer, she slips past them into the cave, just another shadow in this dark place. The dimly lit interior aids her greatly in moving past still more of the Twilight Hammer, many of whom she draws so close to that she could easily silence them forever. But the subtlety is what is called for, and deeper still she goes.

The layout is fortunately pretty simple, and Saeren is able to reach what passes for barracks in this place without incident. Finding clothes large enough for the tauren is the first challenge. Luckily, there are some good targets and Saeren makes quick work of gathering all she needs. She makes a note to pilfer a few things and move them to other parts of the room without her usual flair. Should be fun later when everyone notices valuable possessions put in the chests of others.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Yes, I'm evil."

With a last careful search for anything of strategic value, Saeren departs, making her way out as quickly and silently as she made her way in. The journey back to her friends is one made quicker by the impish joy she feels at having tormented the enemy in a small, mean way.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "And there we go."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Would you be telling anyone about your little prank?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sure :) I will pose that quickly.."

Of course, the first order of business is to provide everyone their new clothes. Second order of business is sharing. Saeren explains, "So I decided to make a few of them suspect each other. I moved some of their possessions around so it looked like a bit of theft is going on. I hope it helps make their stay here that much more miserable.. the vermin."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Kagarn has a response to that, unless Sookie gets in first."

> (OOC) Sookie got nothin

Kagarn rubs his horn, his expression a peculiar combination of amusement and horror. "From what I knew of the Twilight's Hammer before I met any of you," he says, "it's likely that your little 'prank' will lead to bloodshed. It takes very little for members of that cult to suspect one another."

"They dumb," Sookie mumbles. "Cult know nothing matter, all die in end, all destroyed. Thorium dwarves die, Dark Irons die, cult die. No matter who has what."

Nerai looks, "What a cheerful and happy outlook to have. Everyone dies, but it's what we make of the time now that matters." Nerai pulls the clothes on over herself, "Let's go rescue Rolf."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Unless someone has something else, it's time for us to go on to the main event!"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Let's do it!!!"

---

> (OOC) Sookie says, "if we know ahead of time that we're gonna organize a big jailbreak, did we talk about gettin the Brotherhood's help to cover our exit?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Let's go ahead and cover that now."

"This here's the shortest way out of the mountain," Oilfist says, indicating a map of Blackrock Mountain at surface level. "A short run through the mines outside the detention block and ye come up at the base of the great lava lake under the mountain."

"I'll send some of me people ta infiltrate the mountain. It's a narrow choke point, an' we should be able to cover yer escape. But ye need to go in _this_ way when yer goin in," he adds, indicating a rather longer route through the mine tunnels in Searing Gorge, "so ye don't give us away. Yer gonna attract a fair amount of attention in that getup, I should think. Hope yer tauren's a good actor."

"He bad sneak," Sookie replies. "Better this way."

Kagarn nods, with a slight smile. "Sookie's tutelage has proven most instructive. The challenge shall be in enduring the persona of a deranged cultist for long enough." He nods to Nerai. "Besides, as bad a 'sneak' as I am, I daresay Eecee is worse."

Saeren looks thoughtfully at the others, "So do you want me to be in garb, or do you want me to be a shadow on your heels instead?"

Nerai shrugs, "Eecee isn't built to be stealthy. But I think if it turns out we would have needed him, then he wouldn't have helpped. If that makes sense."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "plan also calls for explosives to choke off the Dark Iron dwarves' reinforcements. we got that covered?"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "I don't need Eecee for that. Unless I do? I think a pack full should be sufficient, yes?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "up to you :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I'll leave that up to Nerai. Nerai, do you feel the need to pose anything about that now? And yeah, a large pack should do the trick. Don't trip."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Is there a hook for knowing we need to blow something up? I mean, Nerai is going to bring some explosives along anyway."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Actually... posing."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Someone can pose it or I can, but the plan that would have been discussed involves blowing the tunnesl between the detention block and Shadowforge proper."

Nerai starts to assemble a large pack full of things, mostly explosives, "This should help cut off the detention block from reinforcements or attack paths. Through this is definitely a non-sneak option."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "you should bring along some sort of construct to do that, Nerai."

> (OOC) Saeren is going to eat mac n cheese quickly n.n

> (OOC) Sookie says, "call it C4P0. We can order it to blow up all the garbage chutes leading to the detention block."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, ""

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Does that make Sookie princess Leah. Or is that Rolf now?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "it's Rolf. so when the goblin arrives to save him, he can say 'aren't you a little short for a Twilight torturer?'"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Since IIRC Nerai is short even for a goblin..."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Now Rolf, we will discuss the new developments on the steam armor plans..."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Yes"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "anyway n.n"

Kagarn nods. "Very well then. I believe we've covered everything we could reasonably anticipate. And from my past experience with my comrades, I have confidence in our ability to 'wing it' when it proves necessary."

---

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Do or do not. There is no 'wing it'"

The crew, in their violet robes and their carefully rehearsed demeanor of contempt for the unenlightened, draws nothing more than a few curious looks from the Anvilrage taskmasters, and sullen resentment and fear from the slaves that work the mines of the Dark Irons. It is not until they draw close to the prison bloc that they are challenged. "Halt. State yer business here," says the dwarf at the low overhang adjacent to the prison block, sounding very obviously bored.

> (OOC) Nerai says, "The Circus is in town, step aside."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone in particular want to take the lead?"

> (OOC) Nerai is posing.

Nerai scoffs, and groans, as the effort of opening her mouth in order to communicate with one so obviously crippled in life. "We have some business inside. Please do not delay us further." She starts walking forward again.

The dwarf waves a clipboard at Nerai. "Yeah, whatever, short stuff. Just ye gotta sign in first. I'll get in big trouble if ye don't sign in."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "My god, evil has a bureaucracy. Policy states ya gotta have two evil references."

Nerai takes the pen, and scribbles a name on the sheet, "Come, brethren, we have wasted much time." She sighs, and walks forward.

As the adventurers file into the prison block, Saeren can hear a muttered whisper behind them: "Damn Twilights give me the creeps."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "yaay us"

And as they take in the sight before them, they are all moved to wonder at this statement. For they can hear the pained groans of prisoners - human, dwarf, gnome, orc, and a few others - from barred cells built into the walls around them, and even into the floor. And the stench from some of the cells suggests that their occupants are already dead, and have been for a few days. A cage dangles from a hook near a smaller cavern on the far wall, with a gaunt human in rags staring blankly at passersby with dead eyes. If all _this_ does not give the warden the creeps, what is it about the Twilight's Hammer that does?

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All right. You're in. You can probably fool the Dark Irons unless you do something suspicious, but it's unlikely anyone but Sookie could fool actual Twilights. And you've heard that there are lesser fire elementals amongst the patrols..."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "What next?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "next step is for Saeren to sneak around disabling signal devices and for Nerai to unobtrusively plant charges. our main goal is to stop reinforcements from coming - we want the guards panicked and distracted during the break."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "we also need to locate high-value prisoners."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. Let's go ahead and get started with Nerai and Saeren posing that stuff. The primary mode of signaling for assistance in the prison block is oversized horns planted in various places around the premises, as well as smaller horns carried on the belts of chief wardens."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "There are several smaller tunnels, particularly leading to the Ring of the Law, which can be blocked off by Nerai's charges. The tunnels to the Great Highway are too large to blow, but are blocked by iron bars with locked gates in them."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "If anyone has specific ideas on locating your high-value prisoners, feel free to voice them. In the meantime, Nerai and Saeren, go for it."

> (OOC) Sookie does

Nerai nods, and wordlessly heads down the hall, keeping the hood over her head as she looks for narrow places she can seal off for reinforcements. She finds a nice ridge or rock over the tunnel to the Ring of Law, where she starts to plant some of the sticks, in behind a few of the rocks.

A Dark Iron guard comes by, "Hey! What are ye doing' down 'er, little bugger." Nerai looks up, the hood still covering her face. She gives the annoyed sigh again, "I'm taking some Thaumatic readings at the base of this rock. It doesn't seem very stable, especially in the 5th or 6th spectrum." She chants out, as one does to someone you know isn't going to get it. The guard's eyes glaze, "Alright weirdie, but be quick 'bout it, 'key?" Nerai nods, and completes her task.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "My pose now? :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Excellent, Nerai. Yes, your turn, Saeren."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "They all use horns?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "There isn't any kind of tinker style telegraph, no. It's horns or messengers in person."

Saeren's task is one she is well-suited for. It always seems she is part of the shadows. She steps away for a moment and vanishes like smoke, becoming one with her surroundings. She moves slowly and with purpose, taking extra care to avoid eyes. She notices that horns seem to be the communication tool of choice. Saeren is no master of instruments, but she is able to steal many of the horns, hiding them in odd places, jamming them with filth, or quietly stomping on them when she's safely concealed.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "More coming for the big ones."

The main signal horns Saeren confronts last. They are usually in close proximity to guards, so some finesse is called for. The night elf notices that minor disturbances routinely draw the guards away. These kind of little problems clear her access to most of the horns, just long enough to damage a mouth piece or crack a horn. Other times, she causes the distraction directly by throwing rocks from the shadows.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I clearly hate marching bands with all this horn-destroying."

> (OOC) TidesGM \[Distract\]

> (OOC) Saeren says, "And the last one Saeren distracts by taking her top off and dancing.."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "I don't think that works for Dark Irons"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "I think you'd have to show them your huge ore deposits."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "For that they better buy me a good meal."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "GM, do I see any prisoners of interest or points of major defense on my circuit?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Covering that."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Or any large diamonds that may or may not be the heart of the mountain. n.n"

Many things in the prisons of Shadowforge are only visible from the shadows. Fortunately for Saeren, that is her vantage point. And thus, as she moves unnoticed amongst the halls of the Dark Irons, she sees many things. Other individuals in the robes of Twilight, in particular - and these people seem to congregate around a short loop of tunnel containing the heaviest prison cell doors. And at one point, from a secluded room at the far end of the loop, she can hear the anguished scream of a dwarf.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "What next?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAILBREAK! o/~"

> (OOC) Sookie ^\_^ \\m/

> (OOC) Nerai says, "No more whitesnake for sookie.. 'kk?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "now we find Rolf, and blow the doors off."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Sounds good."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. Do you need anything from me or my NPCs?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "just reactions when we start tearing doors off cells."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "And heads off bodies."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I can do that. Who wants to start the show?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "this is totally my thing. o\_o"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Go for it Sookie ^^"

With what Saeren has learned, the rest is straightforward, but not easy. Sookie approaches one of the Dark Iron dwarves, holding up her metal bracers and beaming happily. "Na, na, look. I elemental soon. No longer human. Hey, got question. Clan have important prisoner, capture and bring here soon. Senator Redwood, Redblood, something red. Anyway. Need see important cells, must bring here safely. No accidents, or we all die. Show cells please."

The dwarf stares at her dully. "Why would ye need to do that?" he asks, suspiciously. Sookie taps her head for a moment. "I remember. Oh! Must see other dwarves in here. They spread messages to each other, we not want that. Where important dwarves?"

The dwarf scratches its head for a moment, apparently having trouble with Sookie's heavily accented Common. And then the lights seem to go on. "The prisoners're talkin' to each other? Yeah, we canna have that. This way," he says gruffly, beckoning. "I'da thought yer Gerstahn would've beaten it out o' them by now, but some of 'em never learn. Which ones're givin' the trouble?"

Sookie thinks for a few more moments. "Uh.. Rolf. Tinker. Make device. Signal Ironforge. We find."

"Huh. Just a moment." The dwarf leads Sookie to the interrogation loop. "We got some tinker named Rolf in here?" he asks the warden at the entrance, who consults a clipboard. "Rolf, Rolf... Ah yes, Rolf Drakfeuer." He grins at Sookie. "Gonna break him in today, eh?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Desire to kill these guys rising."

Sookie lets a few sparks of electricity dance between her fingertips. "Meat no tenderize well, so we cook instead," she explains casually.

The Dark Irons look suitably impressed. "Man, you Twilight people don't mess around," whistles the warden. "Cell thirteen B."

Sookie smiles appreciatively. "You nice. You live when end time comes." And she hops and skips off to report back.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "plan at this point is to head down there and start rippin off doors from their hinges."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "anything stopping that? if not I'll proceed"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Nothing stopping it from my end. Saeren and Nerai, any last preparations?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Good thing I've got time to kill."

> (OOC) Nerai shakes head.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "How about Kagarn and the guards, though?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Elementals, I mean."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "We'll get to that during the jailbreak. There's not really much he can do to sabotage them in advance."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "GM can pose for Kagarn when the time comes, and can retcon anything Kagarn previously did"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "kk"

> (OOC) Saeren is just utilizing the handy BRD planner updates.

Sookie leads her fellow Twilight cultists along the prison loop. She waves with a loopy, deranged smile to the interrogators who stand around making small talk with their Dark Iron counterparts. The closest one to her position once the group arrives at Rolf's cell is a tall troll, who doesn't find anything amiss. The sudden screeching noise of metal goes unremarked in other parts of the mine - this is, after all, a quarry wherein rock is being picked - but he does happen to look toward the source of the noise. His first real inkling that there'll be trouble, though, is when he takes a hundred pounds of metal prison door to the face at high speed.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Hahahah"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "fellow conspirators, want to start killing?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "we should set off the bombs soon."

> (OOC) Nerai will pose something.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Not yet Nerai. There's something you need to react to before that."

> (OOC) Saeren waits for react part.

As the dust clears from the cell door, the grimy torchlight from the walls illuminates a filthy prison cell. Inside is a dwarf in ragged white homespun, blinking in the sudden brightness. "Wha... what's goin' on? Who are ye people?" says a dwarven voice - somewhat ragged and the worse for wear, but very familiar to Nerai's ears.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "It is, indeed, Rolf."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "My name is Nerai, we were sent by Oldguy Kanobi to rescue you."

Nerai nods, as she hears the sound of the door under the stresses that only Sookie can apply, she presses the button on her remote detonator. Even from here the mountain shakes a bit under the blast that Nerai has planted, the rock enveloping the small hallways leading to the prison loop. She listens for the rock falling, then looks up to see Rolf in the chamber. She runs in, and smiles, pulling her hood back. "Rolf!" She smiles, and plants a hug around his midsection. "Come on, we're here to rescue you... And a few others." She turns to the team and nods, "Let's keep going."

Meanwhile, Sookie methodically rips the prison doors from their hinges. She always keeps one spare around, using it alternately as a shield and a battering ram for anyone foolish enough to come down the tunnel.

"Nerai?" says Rolf wonderingly. "By Magni's beard, what're _you_ doin' here, lass?" And he laughs in delight. "Lead the way! But I'd never dream _you'd_ be the one ta be bustin' me out..."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "More."

As the commotion increases, several Dark Irons charge down the hall. "What's goin' on here?" yell several of them, only to be scythed down by a flying prison door. The next wave doesn't bother with challenges or threats, but simply draws axes and charges.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "My turn."

> (OOC) Nerai slips one thing in here

Nerai nods, and leads Rolf out, "You trained me well, what can I say..."

Saeren turns from Nerai and her friend, glaring at the enemies. A moment later the air hums with arrows as Saeren finally unleashes her wrath. She growls softly, "Let them all come.. I'll shoot them down with their splintered bones when I've run out of arrows." The first charge stumbles and falls and Saeren advances, looking for more targets to feel her vengeance.

Sookie flings doors and snaps chains. Occasionally one of her targets will dodge a door; that's what lightning is for.

"What is the meaning of this?" bellows a female voice from the end of the hall. In the middle of the group is a tall human female, almost as tall as a night elf, in the finest Twilight's Hammer robes any of the adventurers have yet seen. Beside her are two beefy tauren in similar robes, and three Dark Iron riflemen. At the sound of the voice, Rolf cringes. "Interrogator Gerstahn," he breathes.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I'll show her the door. o\_o"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "DAMNIT"

> (OOC) TidesGM swaps around.

> (OOC) Nerai says, ""Nonono"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "It's old, don't swap."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Oh ok. it's line 195."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "kk sorry"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "deleted, let's go."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "This is a boss fight. You guys are expected to win, but it's supposed to look challenging. Who wants to go first?"

> (OOC) Sookie has somethin

Sookie readies two prison doors. The first she flings at the woman and her riflemen; the other she slams down against the rocky floor, ducking behind it, to use as cover against their return fire.

> (OOC) Nerai says, "WIthout Eecee my abaility to materially add to the fight is somewhat limited. But I'll throw a few things in when it seems appropriate."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone else?"

> (OOC) Saeren has something, of course :)

> (OOC) Saeren hrms.. wonders what the tauren are..

> (OOC) Sookie says, "tall and tasty."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Maybe they are where buffalo wings come from."

With a fresh target to deal with, Saeren finds renewed focus. While the other woman bellows, she's already firing, her aim first on one of the Tauren. Take out the legs and the table falls. "Just shut up and fight already," she mutters.

Nerai pulls out her not-often used auto-pistol, and ducks behind the door, making sure that Rolf is tucked under there well. She fires a few shots at some of the riflemen, and yells out, "Blunderbusses? Seriously, are you going to put anything except granite in those? You might as well just throw the rocks at us." She shakes her head, "Too bad Eecee isn't here..."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I doubt they make Nikes in her size, Ray."

Gerstahn's entourage weathers the first assault with varying results. One of the tauren manages to deflect the prison door with his pike, but the impact is still enough to knock him back, and the ricocheting piece of heavy iron still smashes one of the riflemen painfully into the stone wall; and the pikeman fares rather worse when Saeren's arrows plunge into his eye sockets.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sookie's gonna have a leather dress and burgers for life!"

Rifle bullets **ping** off the door Sookie is using as cover, and as the dwarves draw back the bolts to eject the spent cartridges, the other pikeman charges forward, only to bellow in pain as he draws too close to the empty cell Kagarn is using for cover and finds his armor serve as a conductor for Kagarn's lightning. "Take out the shaman!" she bellows. "The elf and the elemental girl are mine!" Gerstahn glares at Saeren and speaks a guttural word in no known language...

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I hope sookie's lightning can char broil those riflemen :P I wanna shoot Gerstahn's fancy robes off like some kinda fan service anime! Err.. just kidding."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Roll HT-2 for me, Saeren. I want to fine-tune the special effects a bit n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I forget how to roll vs. a target, it's an 8.. rolling"

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d6 for 10 (3 2 5)

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Darn."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. Shadow Word: Pain hits. If you have some idea of how much your actions will be affected by -2 to all rolls, pose accordingly. The damage won't really factor into it provided Kagarn can step in soon enough."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "It's the party's turn to act again."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "-2 doesn't do much to me, honestly :)"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Since my no aim accuracy is 27 and all >.>"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "It might interfier with your ability to snipe from 200 yards. At this range... yeah."

> (OOC) Sookie is gonna take a shot at Gerstahn. she resistant to lightning? <\_<

> (OOC) Saeren says, "She's about to eat lightning and fire arrows, we'll find out what she's got, Sookie :P"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Her magical shield will deflect arrows, and it's enough for /one/ good lightning bolt."

Sookie fires off a random lightning bolt at the interrogator, but finds her defenses are adequate to absorb it. That's fine, there's other weapons available here. She looks behind her, still holding the door in place as a barricade, ready to snatch another such useful hunk of metal off the ground.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I really gotta find a way to put a stop to that deflection stuff."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "But seeing the lightning get absorbed is enough to tip Saeren off, I would say, no? It's not like she's not seen this stuff before."

Seeing lightning absorbed forces Saeren to alter her approach. She's moving forward, focusing on the riflemen first. When the distance is cut down far enough, then it will be the interrogator's turn.

Nerai looks over at Rolf, "Old Girlfriends are always a bother, aren't they?" She says, and winks, displaying an extrovertedness and humor the blushing little goblin didn't have when the two were last together. She digs in her pack, "Hey guys, I got a bomb or two left.. I can chuck it over, if you guys are ready to fire on them when they scatter? Force them to choose their poison, type of thing?"

A second rifleman falls to Saeren's assault; the third yells, "Backup! We need backup!" The second pikeman starts to get up, the muscles on his powerful forearms twitching, and begins to move toward Kagarn, who is hurriedly chanting another prayer to the air spirits.

Sookie rises from behind her improvised shield once again. She's found her weapon. Snatching the pikeman from his feet, she begins to lift him from the ground.

Gerstahn supports herself on her staff, and looks down the hall, seemingly with eyes for Sookie. "Very good, girl. You've learned to control your powers well. But you _will_ rejoin the fold!" She stalks forward, chanting in Kalimag - and as Sookie lifts the struggling pikeman, she can feel a tugging at her mind.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Time to deal with her.."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "How much distance between me and this chick?"

> (OOC) TidesGM thinks. About... hm... 6 yards by now. She had to come pretty far forward for the thing she's doing to Sookie to have any real chance of working.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Even now it's a bit of a desperation ploy for her."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I think I can clear that and stab her."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I think you're probably right. Do it! And the squad of riflemen coming round the corner will be just in time for Nerai's bomb."

Sensing that her enemies have made assumption that Saeren is just a pretty girl with arrows, the night elf charges forward to change their minds. Her sai sweep out as the night elf throws herself at Gerstahn, plunging both razor sharp tips down for the kill.

> (OOC) Saeren leaves result to GM :)

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm a weaponmaster, dammit, and you will show me respect. Briefly."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "That's how most of your respect is paid, to be fiar."

Nerai shrugs, and reaches into her pack.. She finds an appropriately small charge, and short fuses it. She yells, "Fire in the hole!" as she throws it into the path of some oncoming reinforcements. The charge doesn't take long to detonate, and it takes out the unfortunate soul who's feet it lands under, scattering the others with force, shrapnel, or panic.

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Okay, better."

The magical shield protecting Gerstahn, already weakened by Sookie's elemental assault, vanishes with a barely audible pop as the human folds around Saeren's outstretched hand. "Damn... maybe... in the next life..." she wheezes, blood oozing from her mouth as she slumps forward.

> (OOC) TidesGM is going to swap that with Nerai's.

> (OOC) Nerai wanted to slip the fodder's death in before the main baddie, actually.

> (OOC) TidesGM puts back. it'll do n.n

> (OOC) Nerai says, "You can shift it up to before Saeren's charge, fwiw."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I of course loot her of everything she has."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "We'll cover such details next time, although (spoilers) she'll have usefully incriminating documents. Right now, of relevance is the big keyring."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "not that it matters so much with Sookie around, but she /does/ have the keys."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sweet! Sookie can use the keys as projectile weapons."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Often times keys are made out of valuable metals. Plus if we rip more doors off, it's harder for the jail to be used later."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "That's how I view killing the jailors :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All right. You guys are clear to pose through the rest of the jailbreak."

> (OOC) Saeren lets sookie pose some more prison door breaking? :)

> (OOC) Sookie on it

Grumbling, Sookie stalks through the prison ring, then out into the more open area. She snatches doors from their hinges and hurls them as weapons, heedless of target: anything in here that isn't chained has death coming for it in some form, and any prisoners foolish enough to remain nearby once chains are snapped or bonds are broken deserves death anyway.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone else?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "if they don't, I will"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sorry, had a bio."

Saeren stalks at Sookie's side, flattening enemies that the elemental doesn't notice or that somehow survive the thunderous strike of a flying prison door. She calls out to the prisoners, but some, it is clear, simply don't have the strength to move and Saeren does her very best to ensure every one of them has a fighting chance to escape this horrible place.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "There will be dwarves trying to clear the rubble from Nerais explosions, others trying to get through the jammed gates to the Highway or call out to anyone that might be passing on the Great Highway."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Where's our Exit, Mr. Wizard?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Forgewright's tomb!"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Thataway ->"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "The maps you have from the Thorium Brotherhood have proven accurate thus far, and a particular tunnel on your maps promises to go out through what is, basically, the in-game BRD entrance."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Speaking of Forgewright, Balthar is going to try to follow the best-armed people involved in the jailbreak."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "ah good."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "It would be good if someone covered gathering him into the fold, since he's basically your ticket to the TB covering your escape."

> (OOC) Nerai makes some posie

In the confusion of flying doors and disorganized jailors, The jailbreak crew gather up all the prisoners they can safely liberate, including Balthar. There's little time for pleasantries, as Sookie leads the way to the exit as marked on the map, Saeren covering with random fire, keeping panic just at the right level, and Nerai making sure the prisoners can get out. They find the Brotherhood at the gate as they run up the tunnel.

> (OOC) Saeren poses :)

Saeren ensures she is the last to leave, and that a lot of dead are piled up behind her. She slips away from the group, joining the Thorium Brotherhood to rain pure hell on anyone who dares to follow the escaping prisoners.

> (OOC) TidesGM is prepared to wrap up the scene now. Unless anyone else has something to add?

> (OOC) Sookie got nothin

> (OOC) Nerai is good for nao

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm good :)"

> (OOC) Saeren is off, killing for vengeance.. it's her thing.

The supporting fire from the Thorium Brotherhood is the final straw for the beleaguered prison guards. They retreat in disarray, with even the mining supervisors leaving their posts and heading for the relatively safe ground of the prison proper. The slaves left behind in the mines rejoice, following their fellow prisoners to freedom, and in many cases lending their strength to the more weakened victims. Soon, the chains to Forgewright's Tomb are crawling with fleeing prisoners, while the adventurers, Rolf, and Balthar enjoy a smoother and swifter ride courtesy of a collection of makeshift cable cars that the Thorium Brotherhood had used to deploy their forces.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "One last pose for this scene"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "go ahead, Sookie. I'll fix things up after."

Watching the stream of enslaved creatures fleeing the depths of Black Rock Mountain, Sookie stares in particular at the tunnel entrance. Beyond that portal of stone, members of the Twilight's Hammer still survive, still perform their inhuman traffic with the Dark Irons, still enslave and torture travelers and put them to work here. She wipes a tear from her eye, then another one, and then another, until she gropes her way along with one hand, using the other to cover her face.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Wow :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I think I'll just let that stand as the closing pose for this scene, in fact. Screw the black dragons."

---

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Good call ^^"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Actually... I think it will do as a closing pose for today. The tying up of loose ends at Thorium Point shall be for next time."
