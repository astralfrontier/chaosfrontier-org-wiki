# Turning Tides 2011-03-13

A chest wound is one of the quickest ways to bring down a foe, but in the presence of a skilled shaman, it is not necessarily fatal; and Gerstahn was far too valuable a prisoner to pass up. If anything, Kagarn's greatest challenge in getting the wounded Twilight interrogator safely out of the dungeons of Shadowforge was not in bringing her back from the brink of death, but in preventing the Thorium Brotherhood, or Gerstahn's former victims, from taking their revenge upon her.

The Thorium Brotherhood is appropriately grateful for the rescue of Balthar, and of various other political prisoners. Appropriately grateful by Thorium standards, at least. "Ye held up yer end of the bargain, we held up ours," says Oilfist, with his customary gruffness. Little more is said apart from a brief exchange of cursory pleasantries, and the Defiant is airborne again, headed for Ironforge with Gerstahn and a few other Twilight prisoners securely held in the airship's brig, with Kagarn acting as both healer and warden.

But prisoners are not the only passengers on this flight. A few Ironforge dwarves, rescued from the Dark Irons, reside in the spare quarters. Rolf, despite his ordeal, is not content to remain belowdecks - the Defiant is far too interesting a construction for him to ignore. Any moment that Nerai can spare from flying the airship, he spends with her, catching up on what they each have been doing since Nerai fled from the Jointrust enforcers.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "You can pose in here or not, as you wish. I can just roll forward if this isn't what you want to focus on."

> (OOC) Nerai will pose a handwave of sorts in here. It's not teribly interesting too me, but should be touched on.

Nerai does make some time to come down and see Rolf. The two chat about old times, and about Eecee in general. "I'm impressed on what cha've done to 'im." Rolf comments, about the makeover Eecee has received from Nerai, "Ur's a good student." Much is not said as well, about Nerai's leaving, and the intervening time. Two friends, just happy to see each other. The conversation only ends when Nerai is called back up to the flight desk to prepare the landing.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Good enough!"

Even with Kagarn's care, it will be several days before Gerstahn is healed enough to be on the recieving end of an interrogation, and an unguessable length of time before any useful information can be obtained from her. Nevertheless, Senator Redstone is quite impressed by the testimony of the Ironforge survivors, who have much to say about the Twilight Hammer's involvement with the Dark Irons, and sends Crag Steelbeard to request a personal discussion with the adventurers.

"You shall have your audience with Lord Bronzebeard," says Senator Redstone. His Common is a good deal less Ironforge-accented than usual; either he was raised among humans or he has had considerable dealings with them. "But in the meantime, there's another matter I wanted to talk to ye about. Have ye heard of the Bael Modan expedition, in Kalimdor?"

> (OOC) Sookie has connected.

> (OOC) TidesGM will continue unless someone wants to interject. Ezra will probably have mentioned it at some point.

> (OOC) Nerai is interjecting.

Nerai looks at her companions, "Umm.. Yes I've heard about it." She smiles, "I knew someone that was on it, in fact." She frowns slight, and things, then smiles again, "What about it?"

Redstone consults some notes. "Ah yes, the letters from Dalaran did mention ye knew the Forsaken mage. Small world," he chuckles. "Well, the Council here has mostly left the matter to the Explorer's League, but with the information you've brought back from Blackrock, the Dark Irons' interest in Uldaman is a lot more worrying."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "More"

"Y'see, according to the League, the Uldaman installation may contain some means of contacting the Titans in case of the Old Gods' awakening. We'd thought the Dark Irons were just interested in the origins of our kind, but if they're in league with the Twilight's Hammer... well, I've already convinced King Magni to authorize a military expedition to retake Uldaman."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Yet more."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Actually. Does anyone have anything to say at this point, before I go on?"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Not yet."

Senator Redstone leans forward, resting his arms on the table. "Now, we'll have some of our finest from the Explorer's League along, but... well, between you and me, I think you lads and lasses have got a much better focus than they do on what _you_ think is at stake here - on finding some way to deal with these Old Gods. It's one thing to convince the King to go to war on the Dark Irons - but if you want to convince him to go to war on the naga as well, well, I think it'll help your case if you can _personally_ tell him about what we find down there." He looks at the adventurers. "Will you help us once more?"

> (OOC) Sookie tries for "uhh, totally negatory" but is vetoed by Kagarn

Nerai looks at the Senator, then back at Kagarn and the others, "Seems likely." She says, smiling, "Though I do have one condition. I would like to meet with whoever you have leading the force against the Dark Irons." Nerai looks back, "We have lots of ways we can help.

Redstone nods. "Aye - I was hoping to hear just that. Let me introduce you to the commander of the expeditionary force. He can get you in touch with whoever can best use your assistance."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anything else here?"

> (OOC) Nerai shakes head.

---

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. This is where Nerai can begin making contacts who can teach her of warfare and tactics, and vice versa. If you don't have anything now, we can close this log and reopen it (or start a new one) when you do."

> (OOC) Nerai isn't really ready to do this right this second. Sorry.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "That's fine. I just wanted to get the setup in for when we do."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "so what in general are you thinking of doing tho?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "like contemporary WWI earth tactics on Azeroth, or just advancing the state of the art in goblin/gnome tinkering and magitech?"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Honestly, I'm not totally sure. It just seems like a fun thread to pursue long term, honestly."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "More the former than the latter, though."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "it does, just wondering if you'd thought it through. the reason I ask though is that tactics follow technology. we didn't think air superiority and recon mattered until we had airplanes, for example."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "so if you go 'la la la trench warfare', the first mage with a good Blizzard spell will put paid to your infantry."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Heck, for that matter, this setting has steam tanks, which also did a lot to alter the nature of trench warfare. With tanks in play, you really need to think WW2 as much as WW1."

> (OOC) Nerai nods, "Of course. "

> (OOC) Nerai says, "I'm not thinking 'Let's follow history exactly' I'm more thinking 'I like grand strategy, let's play some of that.' And 'Let's give Nerai a good longterm goal' I don't have an end in sight, really."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "then my suggestion for how to get to that goal is: 'we need sensible leadership to take goblin, gnome and dwarf inventions, and put them to practical use'."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "That's fine. In that case, let me give you something concrete to work with."

> (OOC) TidesGM notes: http://www.wowwiki.com/Angor\_Fortress

> (OOC) Sookie says, "it's often said that generals are prepared to fight the last war. You can work to prepare them tofight the next one"

> (OOC) Nerai nods, 'k

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Angor Fortress is your immediate military objective for next session. It's a hardened fortress with gunpowder defensive weaponry and some steam tank, rifleman, and infantry forces."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Oh yeah, piece of cake. :D"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I've kept log open specifically to preserve this discussion. n.n"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Ohshi-"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "HAY NERAI you said you had some XP to spend, right?"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Yes."

> (OOC) Nerai can't remember spending XP since switching to GURPS.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "if you were gonna invest any in steam armor upgrades, I can't think of a better place than in dwarven workshops with your old teacher."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "O hay."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "and this would give you a chance to talk such things over with him ICly"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "'I am gonna install system X in the suit' 'but why would you do that? its useless?' 'no, tactical situation Y' 'oh, didnt think of that'"

> (OOC) Nerai nods.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "and harking back to an earlier log, this is a way to get Eecee accepted as family into the larger dwarven community :)"

> (OOC) Sookie | The old dwarven smiths take hold of the book, and haul it open with evident effort. On the pages within are names, lines, ovals and all manner of decorative illumination. It is a geneology, a family tree - but not of people. It shows the descent of the dwarves' weapons of war, from the earliest blunderbusses to the most modern steam tanks. Everything has a place here, a history, reverently cherished by the dwarves and amended once a new weapon has been bloodied in conflict with the dwarves' many enemies.

> (OOC) Nerai nodnods

> (OOC) Sookie says, "they have a lot of reverence for the old ways, the proven ways, but maybe that pace of development is too slow. maybe they need a goblin to show them how to speed things up"

> (OOC) Nerai nod.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "anwyay that's between you and GM :)"

> (OOC) Nerai would need to figure out what points to spend first. :)

> (OOC) Sookie says, "you could pose now and spend later, right?"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Maaaayyybe"

> (OOC) Nerai think think.

Nerai finds herself waist deep in parts, once again. It is quiet on The Defiant, and Nerai still likes to work on Eecee in here. Turning the wrench, and pulling the armor apart lets Nerai think in ways that she isn't normally able. She has the armor out in several pieces as she hears some voice calling out from the entrance to the bay.

Rolf calls out, "Nerai! Your friend sayd ye'd be 'ere." The older dwarf calls across the bay, as he makes his way over. Nerai smiles at Rolf, and nods, "Yeah." She looks back at Eecee, then at the mess on the ground.

"Don't look!" Nerai panics, "I just found some things to tweak, that I thought would be good to change." SHe says, meekly. Even working on talking to world leaders and facing Naga head on hasn't tempered some of the Goblin's natural shyness, especially among those she respects.

Rolf chuckles, "Lass, there's no need to be like that. In fact, I need ye to come with me." Nerai looks panicked, "Don't worry," Rolf explains, "We'll get Eecee back together."

The two head into the giant forge, back into tinker town, next to the tram. Many of the dwarves, and fewer of the Goblins, watch as the two are lead back into Rolf's workshop. Jeers would have met Nerai, when they could be spared from busy tinkers, but now only awe is her welcome here.

Rolf introduces Nerai to a team of tinkers, "Lass." He starts, "These boys will help ya with Eecee." Each of the dwarves and Goblins looks up, "They're ready to taker 'im to the next level."

Nerai looks at Rolf, "But.. but.." Rolf shakes his head, "Now lass, one of the things you gotta learn is to take help when offered. You can use our help, while you're here." He smiles, "Besides, it'll be nice to get my fingers on the old guy again."

The team of tinkers works into the night and into the morning, many runs to Eecee are made, moving various larger and larger assembled parts back to The Defiant for measuring and fitting, and finally installing. When Nerai and Rolf are done, as the sun is just settling overhead, Rolf turns to the younger Goblin, "Thank ye lass. For making' me proud." He nods, and walks silently out of the airship.

> (OOC) Nerai says, "There. Tinker montage."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Awesome."

> (OOC) Nerai thinks the part Bill alluded too will come better after the DIs.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All right. Well, I'm still going to engage you in discussions over the next couple weeks about the implications of TL4/5 in WoW warfare."

> (OOC) Sookie okay. in the meantime, Sookie will be electrifying hapless victims here

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Nooooo"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Well wait.. are they the right helpless victims?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "right... wrong... I'm the half-elemental with 50,000 volts."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Worry not. If they're the wrong victims, Kagarn will send her to her room with no venison for dinner."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "In any case..."

> (OOC) TidesGM notes: XP - Nerai - 2
