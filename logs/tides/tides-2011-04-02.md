In another life, Tirion Fordring would have been content to stay a hermit and an exile, leaving his boy to whatever far-off fate lay in store for him. In another life, Tirion Fordring may have sought out his boy; whether he would have arrived in time to forestall a terrible confrontation is doubtful. Today, though, a messenger of the Light has reawoken something in his soul.

He has a horse, and provisions, wrested with difficulty from the barren earth of the Plaguelands. He has enough to survive a journey to the east. He rides.

He finds a patrol of the Argent Dawn's foot-soldiers, who do not recognize him and do not ask his name. From them he learns that Hearthglen is being left behind.

He finds a lone undead creature, still wearing the armor and tabard of the Scarlet Crusade. As it begs him to destroy it, he exacts from it the fact that other Scarlet loyalists are moving to Tyr's Hand. And he obeys its last wish.

> (OOC) TidesGM has connected.

From a high mountaintop, he sees the distant sparkle of sunlight on metal, and reads from it the movement of Scarlet Crusaders. He knows that they are on the move. He resumes riding.

The procession of soldiers must move slowly; their wagons, supplies, and footmen cannot keep pace with a good horse. The ex-paladin rides, and watches. He knows how men move, how soldiers move, and where their command will be. The van, the main and the rear organize themselves in different ways. Silently he reads the attitude of the men he sees. Wordlessly he gleans their fears and their strategy. He knows what he seeks is further east. He rides faster.

The contingent from Hearthglen has set up camp. Tirion tethers his horse and creeps closer. Somewhere here, his son is waiting.

Taelan Fordring paces before the campfire. A few paces away, Grand Crusader Isillien watches.

"We're doing what we must, Taelan," Isillien remarks. "We must meet up with the Admiral. He'll help us. You know he will. He' always been true to the cause."

"But what about the rumors?" Taelan demands. "The Forsaken - free-willed undead? And these sea creatures, the naga, attacking us as well? With a plague even more insidious than the Scourge? Surely we must react to this. The Scarlet Crusade must fight _for_ humanity, not merely _against_ the undead."

"To fight for one is to fight against the other," replies Isillien smoothly. "If he were alive, your father would say the same thing. He fought in the war--"

"My father would have remembered, _Grand Inquisitor_, that humanity is worth fighting for because of honor." Taelan points out into the darkness, making a cutting gesture with his hand. "A quality the Scourge decidedly lacks. These naga sound no better, if the stories are true. That is what distinguishes us. What I am hearing now, though, what I am hearing.. the other stories? About the Grand Crusader? How can we fight honorably if there is any question about such matters?"

"It was a lie, concocted by our enemies," Isillien says. "The Forsaken themselves were there, with those heretics in the so-called Argent Dawn. We have only a few stories emerging from Stratholme, and how can they be trusted?"

Taelan sighs. "My father. If he were here, he would get to the truth of it. You.." He pauses. "We always trusted him. The Argent Dawn's leadership respect him. If he were still alive, he would settle this."

Isillien rises to his feet. "Well he's _not_! Your fabled father isn't here! He's dead. He--"

Tirion Fordring steps into the firelight.

Isillien pales. Many in the Plaguelands can be said to have seen ghosts; Isillien's ashen face tells the same story.

"Father?" asks Taelan, disbelieving.

"I am not dead," Tirion declares. "Although I may as well have been. For too long I let myself rust into uselessness. Now that is changing."

Isillien's shock does not change. Taelan looks back at the Grand Inquisitor, reading in his expression not surprise, not amazement, but simply fear and calculation. "You knew?" he demands. "You knew my father was alive?"

"An error which we will rectify now!" Isillien shouts. "The Grand Crusader orders it!" And from the shadows, more men emerge. Scarlet Crusaders, the guards of the order's leadership, obeying a long-delayed command.

"I've waited too long to say this," whispers Tirion Fordring, as his sword leaves its sheath. Holding the blade forth, the old oath of the Silver Hand springs to his lips.

"By Blood and Honor, I Serve!"

The guards charge. Tirion is ready. Golden power erupts from his blade, from his armor, from his body. It coruscates around him, blinding the men briefly. Even Taelan Fordring, who has witnessed many miracles of the Light from Isillien, holds his hand to his eyes. And in that moment of unrivalled illumination, the camp fire itself merely a dark blur in the background, a paladin leaps forward.

Tirion slashes once, then twice, as the Scarlet Crusade's men bring their steel to bear. More men are appearing out of the darkness behind them. The clang of sword on sword rings out. The old paladin pushes off one foot; his shoulder slams into one of the guards and sends him sprawling. The other recovers only to bring his sword to parry a vicious swing. Tirion knocks his blade beside and punches him straight in the face with a mailed fist.

The two disoriented guards provide Tirion a living shield against their fellows, and he exploits it readily. With a quick shove he sends one of his targets to collide with two more. His sword slides along his metal bracers; he uses his forearm, expertly guiding the blade into the throat of the other man, finding the narrow window of flesh at the center of armor.

"In its grace, I will be made anew!" shouts Tirion. He snaps his weapon out of the flesh of its victim and swings it in a wide arc, forcing the oncoming soldiers to abruptly stop their charge at him. "In its power, I shall educate the masses!" The blade whirls around his body so quickly that it sings, and its blinding aura of holy power dazzles onlookers - they know today what a champion of the Light really looks like. "In its strength, I shall combat the shadow!" As Isillien whirls to leave the fight, Tirion plucks a dagger from the belt of a soldier mid-fall and hurls it at the man's leg.

"And in its wisdom, I shall lead my brethren to the eternal rewards of paradise." In a series of whirling motions and precise stabs, he strikes the vulnerable joints of his attackers through their chain mail, bypassing the plate armor. Another series of rapid strokes, and they fall around his feet.

"If you deem this man worthy, place your blessings upon him!" shouts Tirion, holding up his sword with both hands and looking skyward. But he does not call to the clerics of Northshire, who so long ago anointed him with these words. He calls to the Light.

Fire shines from his blade. He rushes forward. Isillien is his target. The Inquisitor raises a shield of his own power.

"Father, wait!" shouts Taelan. This, and only this, could spare Isillien from Tirion Fordring's wrath. And in that moment of hesitation, in the brief pause that mercy demands, Isillien strikes. Tirion cries out in pain as the Inquisitor's magic takes hold of him, but he is not quite wounded enough. He follows through.

"The Light has passed its judgement," breathes Tirion. "Son.. are you alright?"

"Father!" Taelan throws down his own blade and runs toward Tirion, still aglow with the Light. "I..."

Tirion smiles, accepting Taelan into a hearty embrace. "I'm here now, boy. I'm so sorry I didn't come sooner."

The fleet which sails into Tyr's Hand is greeted with cheers. Scarlet Admiral Barean Westwind steps onto the dock, hailed and saluted by the men and women who still follow the Crusade's ideals.

"Heroes of Lordaeron! Defenders of the living!" Westwind's booming voice spreads across the dock; his words will be repeated via rumor to those further into the settlement. "You do not stand alone. Reinforcements from Northrend are on the way. And the support of... new allies."

As the Crusaders cheer, Westwind steps aside from the others, withdrawing a golden chalice from his pocket and studying it with narrowed eyes.
