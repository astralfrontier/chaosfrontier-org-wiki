The portal between Orgrimmar and Tranquillien is not kept open regularly due to the cost in mage-hours to maintain it. But for an orc like Eitrigg, and a mission like this, speed is vital.

He is met by the undead arcanist calling himself Ezra Pyreborn, who bows low. "I received the messsage," Ezra explains. "I am at your sservice, yess."

"Good." Eitrigg grunts, taking in the unfamiliar air of the Ghostlands. A breath ago, he was amidst the vital, if pungent, atmosphere of far-off Durotar. This air is quiet, redolent with menace, more dead than alive.

"You'll be my eyes, ears and hands, Ezra," the orc explains, after a few moments. "Your report.. I don't think you're compromised yet?" The undead affirms this by shaking his head.

Eitrigg nods. "Very well. The blood elves trust the Forsaken right now, although I'm not sure how long that will last - two blood elf factions aligning with two Forsaken factions. Mmmm, this could very well be trouble."

---

The two travel north, avoiding the roads. Ezra's teleportation magic is sufficient to move Eitrigg and himself in a reasonable time; it's sundown by the time the pair are staring down at distant Silvermoon City from a rocky hilltop.

Eitrigg's plan is put into motion. His reasoning is simple: the blood elves would not simply ally with the naga without motive, and Nazjatar will not forego using its chalice on the blood elves out of kindness. Both sides find mutual cooperation to be advantageous.

From there, it follows that the naga are attempting to overcome the same limitations which have always burdened their invasion plan: the ability to travel overland. "The blood elves can give them cover. There are elf settlements dotting the world. It'd be easy for the naga to infiltrate those. But the Horde will be on the lookout for such outposts that suddenly have a thirst for seawater. A few magical gewgaws are the price they pay for operating without that telltale."

Eitrigg ruminates further. "I agree with your report. The pilgrims are the key. They seem to be the only major force of elves leaving this region. They must be what the naga will be using. I doubt you'll find any naga among the pilgrims, but they must know where they are bound for. You'll have to find out. Once you do, that'll tell us where the naga are planning to sneak into."

Eitrigg puts Ezra to work as scribe. He has letters to write, and through magic they will be sent to their intended recipients. And while Ezra continues to mingle with the pilgrims, replies begin returning.

"I asked some old soldiers I'd fought with," Eitrigg explains, as he reviews the communications with Ezra. "This Martik Tor'seldori was a soldier before he became a demagogue. One of Kael'thas Sunstrider's forces. From your information, blood elves appeared in Outland and attacked the draenei there." He lets out a brief sigh; the name seems known to him, and bound up in memories. But they pass, and he resumes. "There is no paradise on Azeroth that matches this man's description given to the pilgrims. But I fear that Outland very much does, in its present state."

"Then Kael'thass iss recruiting for hiss operationss in Outland via the pilgrimage, yess?" asks Ezra. Eitrigg nods.

The Forsaken scowls through his bandages. "He need only keep hiss intentionss ssecret, or hold the loyalty of hiss people for long enough, and he can move the bulk of them to Outland, yes. Clever, clever - he foresseess the fall of Azeroth at the clawss of the naga, and makess planss within planss."

"I very much doubt that Kael'thas will permit himself to be used by Azshara as a pawn, and I expect he knows Azshara well enough to be aware that she permits no equals." Eitrigg rumbles in thought for a few moments. "Very well then. To maintain political stability, he'll need to keep his regents in place here - letting the leaders depart before the populace will only encourage unrest."

"And they musst gamble that thiss deal with the naga will hold long enough for them to esscape the chalice, yess," answers Ezra. The situation is becoming clearer. "Sso they will of coursse be nervouss. And... perhapss receptive to .. other meanss of ssatisfying their peoples' needss than this rissky alliance?"

Eitrigg grins, showing a mouthful of teeth and tusk. "So a secret meeting with the blood elf leadership is called for. We need someone highly-placed, but not someone mindlessly loyal to Kael'thas. Find me such a person, and we'll proceed."

---

Ezra stands at the archway, waiting patiently. Though he can clearly see the blood elves inside the office itself, not a word can be heard - an effect of the magic upon the arch itself. It permits privacy while providing an illusion of openness.

The office's previous visitor vacates it, and Ezra is gestured in.

"Halduron Brightwing, Ranger-General of Ssilvermoon." Ezra tips his hat politely. "Thank you, ssir, for your time."

Halduron nods curtly. Ezra speaks on: "I bring you newss, sir. Messagess from your farsstriders in the field, yes. Errandss I have run for them have been.. troublesome. There iss suggesstion of .. naga involvement in blood elf affairs."

Carefully Ezra watches the face of the other man, looking for clues. Will this be Eitrigg's contact in Silvermoon? How loyal is he to Kael'thas? Or to the naga?

Halduron is a difficult man to read. His reputation as a ranger is unimpeachable, but it seems that his time in high position has taught him to guard his face. When he speaks, Ezra still harbors doubt. "You're talking about the cargo at the anchorage."

"Jusst so, sir." Ezra feels about him; no active magic seems to have been triggered recently, so it's unlikely that guards are coming to arrest him just yet. He dives in. "I believe that the naga have entered into a bargain of ssortss with ssomeone in Ssilvermoon - trading magic for ssome ssort of conssideration the naga find vital, yes. If, sir, thiss were the case.. the Horde would be notified. Action would be taken. The Horde iss at war with Nazjatar."

At this, Halduron sits back with a smile. "The Horde are already aware of the situation. You're not just here doing me a favor, Ezra Pyreborn. You're feeling me out for someone already, aren't you."

Ezra draws back a moment. Halduron reads his silence correctly and continues: "Very well. I've no great love for the naga. But I'm also a loyal citizen of Silvermoon. Or I must seem to be. My first responsibility is to my people." He leans over his desk, clasping his fingers tightly together, staring his undead visitor in the eye. "You go back and tell whoever you're working for that I'll meet with him, and arrange safe passage in and out of the city. I've got some hand-picked men I can trust. But all you get is information, because that's all I have."

Ezra smiles. "It sshall be done, ssir. Thank you again for your time, and good-bye."
