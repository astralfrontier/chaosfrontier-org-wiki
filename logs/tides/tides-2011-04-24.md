With a foothold in Silvermoon City and Eitrigg taking care of the heavy lifting, Ezra has turned his attention elsewhere for a time. With a ritual circle open on one of the rare untapped places of power still available in Eversong Woods, the mage casts his telepathic communion spell and reaches out to contact the mind of the tauren shaman, Kagarn.

Carefully he listens as Kagarn relates his tale of the group's subsequent travels - their discovery of Sookie, their victories in Southshore and Blackrock Mountain, and their temporary rout in Uldaman.

Of the work on Purgation Isle he has something to report. "Some of the Argent Dawn's men relayed news of a new foundry set up there. They are producing the counter-chalices. However, the paladins have dubbed them 'grails'. Some obscure legend among the Silver Hand, apparently - the blood of a king that can purify the land."

Of this half-elemental, Ezra evinces as much interest as any other wizard from Dalaran, but he isn't quite so hellbent to dissect the girl for study. Perhaps the distance is a factor. "If she is still meddlesome even after entering your service, well.... I can only suggest a few things. My studies in the Sacred Fire have borne fruit, and I have some experience commanding elementals. I think perhaps that you shamans are too soft on the spirits you serve. The elemental powers of the cosmos demand an order to things, and giving them free reign is a recipe for chaos."

"I suggest that you tell her this: that she has Sookie power. That she is not a human, nor is she an elemental. She is something special, partaking from both. Encourage her to build that unique power that is hers alone. Don't try to free her from servitude if she isn't ready. Instead, give her rules to live by. Satisfy her need for order. Do you understand?"

Kagarn muses, amidst the incense wafting around him. His reply comes: "She has had freedom, of a sort, even if it were merely servitude deferred. It has not served her well. I have sought a fitting place for her in the natural order, but thus far my insight has been lacking. I value your advice on the matter."

"Bah." Ezra grumbles for a bit. "I'm no father. She's also a human child. I wish I could ask Elaine.. Andrew turned out so well in some ways, questionably in others. Ah, perhaps it's best that I'm not there to meddle. I've my hands full enough with the blood elves. Good luck, Kagarn, and good-bye."

> (OOC) Sookie covers for GM for a couple minutes here.

While Saeren is still recovering, Sookie pulls Nerai away from work on the steam armor for a question. "Na, na. Kagarn shaman, know about elemental power of storm. I promise I listen other people, not call them stupid so much. So ask you. Tell me 'bout lightning. You use it for some things, like talk-boxes. Tell what goblins know about lightning?"

Nerai looks at Sookie. "Hmm." She ponders this for a moment. How to explain. "I'm not really..." She pauses, "Goblins work with. I guess tame lightning. In small doses." She pauses again, obviously at a loss. "We generate small amounts of lightning to make it do work. By burning phlogiston in a special chamber that enables us to do that."

The girl nods along. "So I burn with lightning. Hurt people. But am told is better way. Tell me what else lightning do. Be useful, but not kill."

Nerai looks, "Erm. I'm not sure what when people say that they're talking about using lightning. But in any case all the ways I seem to use it end up hurting people anyway. You're just more direct about it." Nerai smiles a weak smile, "Want to come back to the workshop? I can show you a talky-box, if you're interested."

"'Kay." Sookie lets a few experimental arcs of energy crackle over her fingers, staring at it with a fascinated expression.

Nerai pulls out a talkie box, and goes after it with a screwdriver. She shows it to Sookie, and smiles, pointing to the two leads from the battery, "Right here." She explains, and looks at her, "Just a little bit now." She cautions, even though she's already counted this talkie box for gone. She smiles as Sookie runs what is, to her, probably, a small amount of current into the box. Unfortunately, Nerai is still holdign the device, and grounds most of the extra wattage off of the charge, and collapses in place, still holding the box in her hand.

Sookie blinks. "Na, Nerai. Hey. You okay?"

Nerai twitches a bit, trying to raise an arm to signal to Sookie a bit.. She lays there for a short time, then starts to get up, "I guess that's one non lethal use." She says, weakly.

Sookie scratches her head. "'Kay. I try it. Thank you." She turns to leave, but stops, and looks back for a moment. "Better if you orc, you know. Orcs good. Grew up with orc. Better if you orc." And then she's gone.

> (OOC) Nerai says, "SHocked then called the wrong race! Awesone. o.o v"

> (OOC) Nerai needs ot wifeidle a bit.

> (OOC) Sookie checks in in Saeren!

From there Sookie peeks in on Saeren's convalescence, sneaking up on the elf as best she can. It'd be embarrassing to be seen at this point, and she herself wonders why she's going.

> (OOC) Saeren hehs :)

> (OOC) Saeren doesn't think Sookie is a stealthy type, ne?

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 14 (4 5 5) vs. 14, succeeding by 0

> (OOC) Sookie doesn't do okay NOW, but is pretty pro

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d for 14 (2 6 6) vs. 14, succeeding by 0

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Tie on per vs. stealth. Hahah :D"

Saeren, even resting, is quite aware. Then again, her distaste for rest is becoming legendary at the camp. She is hunched up, sitting on the floor, focused on what looks like a carefully arranged pile of flotsam. Bits of stone, sticks, and scratches in the ground are arrayed before her. She occasionally moves one, muttering to herself before moving it back. She doesn't show any sign of noticing Sookie, focused as she is.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I figure I might as well assure Sookie that Saeren is dumb n.n"

Sookie has lived warily for three years in solitude. She's a hunter by nature, and in her time of confusion now, her instincts have taken over again. She sneaks closer.

The night elf leans back, reaching behind her back to dig a knuckle into some sore muscles. She mutters something to herself in Darnassian before pushing a stone through the makeshift battlefield before her. An eyebrow raises and she whispers to herself, a bit of excitement evident in her words.

Sookie creeps about. At this point her intention has crystallized: make sure Saeren is functional. Courage assembles itself. "Na, Saeren," she calls out.

Saeren looks up, directly at Sookie, "Na, Sookie," she replies. "I trust you have been keeping yourself busy while I've been laying about."

"Talked to Nerai. Learning 'bout lightning." The girl shrugs, staring off into space. "You fight again?"

"Soon," replies Saeren. "It is what I do. I fight for what I believe will make the world better for my people and the Horde alike." She smiles at Sookie, "You were learning about lightning? I would think you could teach a great deal about it, too."

Sookie thinks about that for a moment. She shrugs it off: "Not know much. Just feel storm power, grow inside me. I call, it obey. But.. Nerai not like that. Nerai call armor power, it obey. But Nerai also make armor, you know? Take it apart, put together. I not know much."

"Would you like to know more?" asks Saeren. "I'm sure that Nerai could teach you a great deal about many things. Goblins love taking things apart and putting them together again." She grins, "Even if they occasionally have a few minor problems." Like explosions.

"I promise I listen. I keep promise, goshi upset if I not," Sookie explains. "Fix self up. Be ready to fight. We kill more soon." She pauses, looking a bit flustered. "Well. I guess.. we go back Uldaman soon. We do .. whatever, I guess. Dunno." With that, she runs off again.

> (OOC) Sookie is good to go

> (OOC) Nerai is backish.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Excellent timing."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Heh."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sookie is cute."

The dwarven medics have a lot of experience with heavily wounded warriors who are overeager to get back to the fight, and deal with the problem in different ways, depending on the situation. In this case, their solution is the most straightforward: heal Saeren as fast as they possibly can, so that she doesn't have enough time to get impatient with them.

> (OOC) TidesGM fixes lack of name.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "My medic should be called Hawkeye n.n"

Gravelbeard is there to see off the adventurers as they make their second foray. "Now that ye lot know what ye're gettin' into, I'm sure ye'll do a lot better. Just be careful in there. They've clearly laid up provisions fer a long siege down there, so who knows what else they got in the way o' ordnance."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone have any parting words before you go in again?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "negatory"

> (OOC) Nerai shake head.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Unless I hear from Saeren before I finish my intro poses, I'll begin."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sorry, one incoming :)"

Before she leaves, Saeren bows deeply to Gravelbeard, "Thank you and your people for your care. I promise to make our enemies pay dearly as a small tribute of my affections." The night elf adds, When we meet again, may all our people be in a happier state than they are now."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "That's all :)"

The upper reaches of the Uldaman excavation aren't much different from their earlier foray. Eventually, and with great caution, they reach the site of the previous ambush. It's abandoned now, but the Dark Irons have definitely been here since. The remains of the crates and the bodies have been removed, and Sookie's gory message of warning has been scrubbed away and replaced by a white chalk outline of the Dark Iron crest - a hammer with a stylized flame above it.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "oh it's on now."

Kagarn muses. "There are differences, but this logo is not unlike that of the Twilight's Hammer, even though the orcs did not come to this world until centuries after the dwarven civil war. Coincidence, or fate? Only the ancestors know."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Unless someone /really/ wants to run with philosophical speculation, I'd rather hear more about tactical response. Unless you want me to carry you through to the first (successful Perception check/hostile action)."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "do we have a map to consult?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "(not expecting a JPEG or anything here, but do the characters have one)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "There is a map. For those of you who've actually been to Uldaman, consider that your guide, more or less. The first ambush took place in the first chamber in, the one with the tunnel in a pit on the floor."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "actually on that note I'm gonna go log in and see for myself. It's been a while."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyway, I know more or less where things'll go down."

Sookie badgers Kagarn for the expedition map, a copy of the Explorers' League working notes. "Na, goshi," she asks. "Dark Iron have maps too? Cave of their own? Place where important people go? We find that."

"The Dark Iron surely have maps of their own, and I doubt there's been time for more than the most basic of excavation since this map was drawn," Kagarn notes. "We have no intelligence on their disposition, so we shall have to make deductions."

Sookie frowns. "They probably have mages here? I find." Closing her eyes, she starts to concentrate.

There are unmistakable signs of magic in use here - and rather than the incidentally elemental magic that Sookie remembers from the mages of Dalaran, the workings are much more clearly shamanic in nature.

Sookie begins pointing out spots on the map as she feels them. "Here.. here.. and here..." she mumbles, before diving back into the stream of godhood that permeates the ancient Titan facility.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "more. stay tuned"

However, the details of what Sookie can detect are vague - and deliberately so. Near the site of the most prominent entrance into undamaged Titan ruins, labeled "Dig One" on the Explorer's Guild maps, there is a swirling vortex of fire elemental energy that frustrates all of Sookie's attempts to see past it.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Do you get a Talent bonus to your analysis roll?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "the description says 'all uses of a power' so I assume yes"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Then Sookie knows that it's a deliberate working to obscure magical observation beyond that point - Sookie doesn't know the name Scrywall but she could describe it in those terms."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "It was a very expensive working, and is almost certainly the reason magical communication with the Explorer's League expedition is cut off."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "For those following along in your in-game maps, Dig One is the chamber in front of the instance entrance."

Sookie explains what she's found in Kalimag to Kagarn. "Big swirly thing," she explains to the others.

"The Dark Irons do not want anyone seeing what they do here. But where magic fails, the mind may succeed," Kagarn says. "Saeren, if you were charged to defend this site, how would you go about it?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Saeren, this is Tactics, and I have made the appropriate rolls. Ask, and I will answer accordingly."

Saeren reviews her knowledge of the Dark Iron forces. Apart from the riflemen with which she is all too familiar, and the fire elementalists that can be deduced from Sookie's observation, they almost certainly have priest-medics - priests of Ragnaros or the Old Gods, but still capable of wielding healing magic - as well as miners, some of which may be trained as combat engineers.

The Explorers' League maps describe Dig one as a vaulted chamber, perhaps eighty yards wide, tall, and high. The tunnel leading down has an overlook at the top of the vault before burrowing down to ground level; notes reveal that this is where the excavators first broke through into the chamber before digging a ramp inside the rock to the base.

Since the overlook makes an excellent sniping platform over the vault proper, even the most basic knowledge of tactics dictates that the approach to the overlook must be defended in some way.

Typical Dark Iron tactical doctrine relies primarily on the rifle, and on mowing down the enemy from range. Melee formations are not common, and focus mainly on shield walls and pikemen to protect the lightly armored riflemen - the anvil to the riflemen's hammer. In caverns and mines, other options exist for preventing enemy advance.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So we're likely to run into fire elementals.. and guns. I hate guns."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Your Tactics roll allows you to ask the GM for advice. Whether it is /good/ advice depends on your margin of success vs. the enemy commander."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So how do I best get to the overlook which will give us the advantage in pegging these guys?"

The route to the overlook is a relatively short tunnel with a downhill slope. There is not enough space for much of a firing corridor, or for nearly as many riflemen as Saeren faced in the upper galleries. Knowing that an assault is likely to come, the Dark Irons most likely set up a barricade with murder-holes.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I have enough to start with."

Saeren explains the various thoughts and defenses she expects to the others, and finishes with, "We will need to take the overlook. It's the best place for us to begin, and the worst place for them to defend. Sookie, the enemy is likely to defend themselves behind some kind of barrier with small holes in it for them to fire through. Can you do something about that? Maybe by blocking the holes?"

Sookie nods. "Plenty rock here. I bring some along."

"Kagarn, Nerai, what do you have to help us destroy enemies behind a barrier?" asks Saeren. "I'm not sure what it will be, but I doubt they'll be stupid enough to hang out in the open."

"I can draw fire well enough." Nerai comments, "And I could probably toss some explosives. Even if they don't hurt them they might flush 'em out."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "If only we were smart enough to know that water conducts electricity.. water on them + sookie = win n.n"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I dunno if you're that dumb at all. n.n The question is how much water you have access to."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "That's true, too."

> (OOC) Sookie asked earlier, we dun have much

> (OOC) Saeren waits for Kagarn to weigh-in :)

Kagarn shakes his head. "I have few options to deal with foes behind a barrier. The advice I would offer would be for Sookie to demolish the barrier."

"Sounds like a reasonable idea," agrees Saeren. "Let's gather whatever items we might need and be about our business then." The night elf's words come off lightly, but there's a greater focus in her eyes than ever.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "let's go get killed! n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sounds like a plan! n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Saeren just wants to get to hang out with Ezra more often."

Two bends before the final tunnel approach, Saeren calls a halt. Not because of dwarven voices, but because her eyes caught the faintest glint of something at ground level. A tripwire.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Nasty little buggers."

Closer inspection reveals more details - the wire is anchored in the rock at one end, and leads to a roof support pillar at the other end, through a series of tiny eyelets, to a lantern hanging from the top of the pillar.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "How do you proceed?"

Nerai looks over what Saeren has found, "I can probably tie the line up here without out disturbing the trap." She looks down, "Just teing it off here should work."

Saeren looks at Nerai for a moment, then to the wire. "Or we could just step over it," suggests the night elf.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Disarming this trap would be with the Traps skill (default IQ-5 or Lockpicking-3)."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "I Guess even chances then."

Nerai shrugs, "I suppose that's probably safer."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Avoiding, then?"

Further down the corridor, however, is a second tripwire, this one at waist level. For most of the party, ducking or crawling under it would be easy, but maneuvering Eecee past it would be a challenge.

Saeren frowns at the wire, looking very thoughtfully at it. "Guess there's nothing to it, we have to disarm it your way." The elf looks back and smiles, "If something goes wrong, we must be ready to deal with them, however."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Is there a hiding spot slightly up ahead, GM? I want to hide in case.. and crossfire the enemy if they come past."

Nerai looks around, "If someone can hold the lantern steady, there's probably less chance of having a problem disarming it."

> (OOC) Nerai idle a bit.

"Just show me what and where," volunteers Sookie.

A closer examination from Nerai suggests an incendiary trap - a concealed nozzle at the base of the lantern would spray a fine mist in front of it, presumably to be ignited by the lamp. Nerai catches a faint whiff of phlogiston, suggestinig that the fireball would be a good deal stronger than from mere lantern oil.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "The tunnel is rough-cut, with a number of niches. There are hiding places and shadows."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I will find a spot to hide up ahead.. just in case. Arrows drawn and knocked, etc. n.n"

Nerai hrms, "Kagarn, can you douse the area around the lantern? That certainly might be safter, in any case. I think think I have enough water to do it and still run Eecee."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Sookie, can you telekinetically manipulate water? We've got canteens, so there's no need to spend FP to conjure some."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "the Hydrokinesis perk lets me do that yes"

> (OOC) Sookie thought ahead!

> (OOC) Nerai)

> (OOC) Sookie badgers Kagarn for sookie-snacks

"I cannot. But I believe Sookie can," says Kagarn, pulling out a canteen. "Sookie, there are vents along the sides of the lantern. Do you think you can douse the flame inside?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "assume that I do so and let's include that in the disarming pose, please"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "It'll be a standard DX roll, with applicable Talent bonus."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "TK roll:"

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 7 (3 3 1) vs. 16, succeeding by 9

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Nerai, go ahead and roll Traps. Sookie's roll gives you much lower chance of serious consequences on failure."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "more than that. I can keep the lantern from being jostled at all, giving Nerai more leeway in which to work."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Well, if she douses it, we can just cut it and she can pull the lantern down, ne?"

> (OOC) TidesGM nods. Let's call that a bonus to the Traps roll.

> (OOC) Nerai rolls 3d6 for 10 (3 4 3) vs. 10, succeeding by 0

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Nerai, for all you know, there could be an alternate ignition source. You can't be sure without a closer examination of the lantern."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "THat's no bonus or anything, so..."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "In any case, you do succeed handily. The lantern is doused, and there is no fuel expulsion much less ignition."

Nerai nods, "Thanks, Sookie." She busies herself at the eyelet, typing the line securely down, and making sure not to rock the lantern too much, though with Sookie's help with holding hte lantern still and dousing it, this isn't much of an issue.

There are no further traps, and soon Saeren calls a halt just before the final corner. The tunnel is strangely quiet - not even the sound of breathing - although there are somewhat fainter sounds beyond, with an echo suggesting activity in the vault itself.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Looking around the corner without being seen is a Stealth roll vs. the Perception of anyone on the other side. The tunnel is backlit, as before."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Compensating for the backlight is the advantage that you only need one eye around the corner, which means there's very little for them to see."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Alrighty, I'll go for it. n.n"

A quick glance around the corner reveals the expected barricade. It is made of iron-riveted plates, and the expected holes are present - a handful of holes around dwarven eye height - though no sign of eyes or rifle barrels beyond them.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Do we know that iron conducts lightning/electricity?"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Yes"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Nice."

Saeren pulls back from her spying and quietly explains what she's seen to the others. The barricade being made entirely of iron is something she's clearly quite happy about.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "So are you indeed gonna have Sookie light it up?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Leaving that to Bill to make the call. n.n"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "can do, sure"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Sookie isn't armored. Since you know where the wall is, and anything in that direction will hit, a smoke cloud covering the position seems indicated."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Who wants to pose us off?"

> (OOC) Sookie can do it. do I have smoke?

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Nerai has smoke."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "k, rolling with that"

The party is ready. While Nerai preps a smoke bomb, Sookie casts about for a small rock. And when the bomb rolls its way in front of the iron barrier and begins to puff, the girl throws it at the barrier. Something will have to get the enemy's attention.

Between the sound of rock on iron and the smoke cloud suddenly billowing across the hallway, the attack has clearly been noticed. There are shouts in dwarven, followed by a ringing sound of gunfire as the enemy shoots blindly into the cloud. There are pinging sounds as the bullets knock chips off the far wall.

Sookie spreads her fingers. A wash of whiteness flows from beneath the bracers on her wrists, overtaking her human skin with the veneer of a wind elemental. From her lambent eyes, a similar effect erupts over her face. Brief arcs of power dance across the newly transformed flesh as her power marshals to her command. And when it is ready, she begins hurling it at the barrier, hoping that it'll jump to the dwarves beyond. Bolt after bolt of lightning is let loose - she doesn't much care where it hits, trusting her companions' wisdom that it'll jump through to the right target.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I can sustain 6d of lightning throughput pretty much forever n.n"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Roll damage, then."

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 6d for 20 (2 6 2 2 6 2) damage

> (OOC) Sookie says, "you want more?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "What do you think? Will 20 pretty much hand them their asses?"

The dwarven voices turn to screams of agony, quickly silenced. And after that... there is a grinding sound of metal on stone, followed by a series of clanking sounds. And then a pair of metallic thuds, which sound for all the world like heavy footfalls.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Yes and no."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "gonna try to TK the barrier off its mount, GM. max lift is 3600 lbs with both compartments active, or 1800 with one"

As Sookie reaches through the cloud to grasp the barrier, she discovers to her surprise that it's much heavier than she expected. Moreover, it's not a flat wall, not anymore. She feels two discrete objects, with what she quickly realizes are humanoid shapes.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "k, backing off then"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Very big humanoid shapes, I might add."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "On the other hand, no more gunfire."

"This for you, Nerai," Sookie remarks as she scurries out of the way.

Nerai blinks, "Wha.. " She looks into the chamber, and pilots Eecee to the front, "What did we find here?" She looks at Sookie.

Through the thinned leading edge of the smoke cloud, the foe becomes clear. Filling the corridor are two dark iron statues, in the shape of dwarves but much bigger. Each of them bears broad plates on its forearms and shins, which had previously formed the frontal part of the barrier - though one set of plates is partially melted from Sookie's assault. Behind them, almost as an afterthought, are the smoldering shapes of what once had been Dark Iron riflemen.

In a flash, Saeren realizes that she had briefly forgotten one other part of the Dark Iron war doctrine: golems.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Huh.. not sure if my arrows even hurt them.."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "For the record, this isn't something I simply neglected to tell you."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Unlikely, Saeren. No weak points to target, and high DR."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I need to raise tactics n.n"

Nerai looks behind her at Saeren and the others, "Ideas? Hopefully quickly?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Need mage work on these."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "are they big enough to come down the tunnel where we were?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "They can navigate any of the tunnels you came in by, although for some of them they would have to go single file."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "good."

"Back to tunnel," calls Sookie. "Use tripwire."

Saeren frowns in thought, "Well, time to find out just how much damage they can take." She looks to Sookie and nods, "Now that's a great idea! Let's use what we have.."

Nerai nods, seeing what Sookie has in monds, she starts back downt eh corridor too, running to where the second tripwire was.

The earlier tunnel is narrow enough that the golems must navigate it in single file. As they approach the first trap, Kagarn says, "Sookie. The lantern. It is doused, but the fuel will still ignite."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "okay. I'll grab it as we run past"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "and then throw it on the one in front, letting the second tripwire ignite both sets of fuel"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "You made a spectacular IQ roll, so I can tell you to grab it by TK, not with your hands."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I'd throw it with TK anyway, so. n.n"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "need anything from us to make this pose happen, GM?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I have fire if we need it."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "My arrows, natch."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Where will you and teh golems be when Sookie first grabs the lantern?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "we left the first tripwire entirely alone, remember?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "we disarmed the second. I want to use fuel from #2 and let them trigger #1"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Yeah :)"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "so double the explosion :)"

> (OOC) Sookie is on it.

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 7 (2 2 3) vs. 6, failing by 1

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Typo on the target number, so actually succeeding by 9. Sookie grabbed the lantern without setting it off."

"Leave to me, goshi!" calls Sookie, sounding determined. The party has a speed advantage, so she has time for delicacy. As the first of the two golems reaches the disarmed tripwire, Sookie expertly pours the remaining fuel on it from a good distance away. Satisfied, she sprints off back down the tunnels behind her companions, and is the last to leap across the still-active tripwire at the far end.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Nerai, you do know about FAE. You guys want to be well clear when this goes off, if only for the sake of your eardrums."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "If you could give a quick voice pose with this advice, in your own words, I'd appreciate it."

Nerai keeps running, "Guys.. THis is not going to be.. controlled. We should get well clear. It's going to sound pretty cool, though." SHe pushes Eecee faster.

Saeren looks at Nerai and laughs, "For you to say that.. now I'm wondering just what is going to be left when this is done." She will not be the first one out, but she will be moving as fast as she can without leaving Kagarn behind.

The party gets around the corner and several yards further along, which Nerai judges a safe distance; as a precaution, they huddle behind the bulk of Eecee and cover their ears.

The precaution is well justified. The explosion sends a sheet of fire licking across the corridor from which they'd come, and even over their muffled ears the pressure wave is deafening. Dust falls from the ceiling; it's fortunate that the traps were not meant to cause a cave-in.

And after the explosion... nothing. Only a ringing in their ears. And notably, _not_ a pair of titanic footfalls.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Go back and check it out?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "yeah"

Saeren pushes herself to her feet quickly, saying in what she thinks is quiet but is not, "I'll go take a look." With stealth, she will move ahead to find out what is left of the enemy.

> (OOC) Saeren goes first, caution, caution.. of course, the whole PLANET knows we are here n.n

The support pillar which had once held the trapped lantern is now merrily aflame along its entire length, and the stone walls are blackened and charred all the way back to the far end of the tunnel. And at the base of the pillar... two still-glowing lumps of molten metal, more resembling gingerbread men than golems. One club-like arm, the fingers fused into an iron mass, briefly raises as Saeren approaches, and then is still.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Both lantern-fuel loads going off at once was a lot of boom. More boom than the combat engineers had intended."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Next steps?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "check for others"

Saeren cautiously makes her way back to the corridor leading to the overlook. There is no sign of enemy movement - just the corpses of the riflemen which had the misfortune or foolishness to use metal golems as cover against a wielder of lightning. The lights of the vault can be seen beyond them.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Next?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "check the bodies for intel. Maps, tokens, useful info"

Being careful to avoid being seen from the vault itself, Saeren rifles the bodies. There isn't much reading matter, but one of them does have a Dark Iron map of the caverns. Correlating with the Explorer's League map, she deduces that the Dark Iron leadership isn't in the vault itself. The chambers from which the expedition are led are in other parts of the ruins; but it is the Uldaman entrance in Dig One that leads to the last known position of the Explorer's League expedition.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "What next?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "guess we move on, try to find any other explorers."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "It's likely that there are dwarven riflemen in the vault."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "as far as I'm concerned our overall goal is to knock over the Dark Iron leadership here."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "End racism, kill everyone."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Your goal is to rescue the Explorer's League expedition and ensure that you can depart afterward. If you take the vault and disable the Scrywall, Kagarn can send back a message to Gravelbeard that the way is clear for him to move in. The vault's a pretty defensible position."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "From there, he can pretty much wait out the Dark Irons."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Let's do thiiiiissss"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "bah, I prefer killing them all n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So do I n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "This is why Nerai and Kagarn are in the party. >.>"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "So, Saeren, how do you proceed?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "okay! oh hey GM, are the guns still halfway functional?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Alright, let's keep moving farther in. We need to break the scrywall."

As for the equipment, one of the guns being carried by the riflemen is probably salvageable in a few seconds by Nerai; the others will need major repairs. Bullets and powder horns are mostly not combusted, with the exception of one particularly unfortunate dwarf who will definitely need a closed casket.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "So what are you doing? Going further down the tunnel? Sniping from the overlook?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Let's see what we can snipe from the overlook."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "What precautions against return fire?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Can we do anything with the dwarven barrier?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Can Eecee lift it?"

> (OOC) Sookie can go back and try to pry it loose. ^\_^

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Can Sookie + Nerai do something with it?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Not all of the barrier was built into the golems. There are some plates lying on the ground."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Sookie can hold it up, and Saeren can use it."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Let's pose that."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "ok"

Sookie brings to bear one of the loose metal plates still laying about from the dwarves' earlier defense. If she can guide it to protect Saeren, the elf can attack without fear of retribution.

> (OOC) TidesGM will take over briefly.

As the barrier is lifted into place, rifle fire echoes through the vault, some of it pinging off the barricade - one shot clangs uncomfortably close to Saeren's cheek. From behind, she can see about six dwarven riflemen; their own cover is merely makeshift boxes, from which they must emerge whenever they fire.

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 5 (3 1 1) vs. 2, failing by 3

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "They've got a -9 range penalty and a further -9 because they effectively have to make an eye shot. Not really a chance in hell. You have the same -9 range penalty but you can ready action to shoot them as they pop up."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Honestly, I'm not even sure I need you to roll to hit here."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Nor do I.. can I just pose their annihilation?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Let's do it."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "By the way, the barrier's pretty heavy since it's intended to be rifle-proof. Saeren couldn't carry it around by herself. Good thing you've got Sookie."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Nerai for tanking, Saeren for DPS, Kagarn heals, I support :)"

The dwarves, so wrapped-up in the heat of the moment, don't seem to notice what is happening. Protected safely behind Sookie's shield, the night elf sentinel decimates her enemies, arrow after arrow finds its mark, until at last there is complete silence. Saeren waits a moment, then turns to Sookie, giving a thumbs-up.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I will be retrieving arrows whenever I can, too n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sookie can do some scary dps, too.. she's kind of an AOE specialist :D"

As the party makes its way down the ramp, Eecee in the lead as a precaution, there is no further Dark Iron resistance. Down one corridor - the one leading to the Dark Iron leadership's stronghold - they can hear receding footsteps, presumably a runner who'd been lurking in the tunnel out of sight, and was dispatched as soon as Saeren engaged.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "don't suppose I can catch up to him safely"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Not really. Saeren /might/, but he's got a head start."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Honestly, I'm going to need to go to sleep soon. Sorry, it's just been a very full weekend."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I'll wrap this up, then."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "it's fine, this is a good stopping point"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "THanks."

As the rest of the party takes up defensive positions just in case, Kagarn finds a ritual pentagram etched into the floor, which Sookie finds herself unable to approach. "Nerai, if you could be so kind as to disrupt the lines of this diagram?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "This is a combined Pentagram and focal point for the Scrywall spell. Disrupting it will break the spell, and a good stomp from Eecee should do the trick."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So there was no hope of me blowing the dorf away? :)"

> (OOC) Saeren feels compelled to try, just for old time's sake n.n

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "The messenger? If he were running across level ground, you'd be able to pick him off easy. But he's down several tunnels by now, and by the time you caught up to him he'd already be behind further defenses."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "kk"

Nerai nods, and walks over, dragging Eecee's feet along the ground as she scuffs out parts of the pentagram.

> (OOC) Nerai says, "How large is the hole he ran into? Can Sookie cover it with a barrier or something?"

As Nerai does so, Sookie can feel the charge of elemental magic in the air dissipate and fade away. The scrying ward is broken. Kagarn settles into a seated meditative position and casts a brief spell of communication, informing Gravelbeard of their success.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "it also means my Detect should now work past this point"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Between Sookie and Eecee it'll be easy enough to barricade the tunnel. It won't be a perfect defense, but you guys will have no trouble holding the vault until reinforcements arrive."

Nerai starts to puck up rack and metal to haul it over to where the runner ran down, 'We should baracade this up to avoid any more visitors." She says.

Kagarn orders Sookie to assist, and in a matter of minutes, a makeshift barricade is constructed. It isn't a perfect defense, but with the formidable fighting skills of the adventurers, it is more than adequate to hold the tunnel for a short time.

And a short time is all that is needed. Gravelbeard, along with a squad of riflemen and combat engineers, soon arrives in Dig One. "Good work, people. We'll hold the fort here. If ye all could head inta the dig and rendezvous with the expedition? There's a buncha troggs loose in there, but nothing ye lot can't handle easily."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Closing poses, and we'll start on the instance run next time!"

> (OOC) Sookie got nothin

> (OOC) Nerai is good here

> (OOC) Saeren hmmss.. poses.

Saeren grins at Gravelbeard, "Glad we could be of help. And as for going in farther, we wouldn't have it any other way." She turns to her friends, "We've come this far, might as well finish the rest off together. A few troggs aren't going to slow us down."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anything else?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Not from me n.n"
