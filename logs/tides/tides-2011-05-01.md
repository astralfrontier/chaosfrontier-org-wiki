Ezra hasn't been privy to the intense negotiation happening between Eitrigg and the leadership of the blood elves. He's been kept busy, spying on the movements and activities of the Blood Knights.

This knightly order of blood elves seems to be modeled along lines akin to the Silver Hand, and its members have a command of the Holy Light to rival any human paladin. Their haughty attitude is remarkable even among the sin'dorei, and Ezra is reminded of what spurred him to consider the Sacred Fire possible - the idea that virtue is not a prerequisite to power, only a check on its misuses.

The Blood Knights are the strongest holdouts against Eitrigg's plan. Right now the old orc is plotting to convince the sin'dorei pilgrims to travel overland, and is working to convince the blood elves that such a decision is both safer for them and hinting that this will also serve their naga allies - without seeming to do so.

The Forsaken's skulking and reconnaissance of the Blood Knights has not gone unnoticed. At long last, Lady Liadrin speaks to Eitrigg. "We are forming an expedition to the southern Ghostlands," she explains. "My Knights are going to fight against the traitor - Dar'Khan Drathir. He is the commander of the Scourge who still haunt the southern woods. His death would allow the pilgrims safe passage to the Plaguelands. What lies beyond, of course, must be up to the Horde to provide, as you have promised. If you are serious about this matter, you should send that undead spy you keep on a leash with our forces. Let him prove his loyalty in deeds."

The night before the expeditionary force is due to ride out, Ezra's meditations are interrupted by a vision. In his mind, he sees a shimmering geometric form he has seen before: the naaru, those allies of the draenei. But this is not O'ros, the one he met in the Exodar. How many are there, he wonders.

_Ezra Pyreborne_, speaks a voice in his thoughts. _I know of the mission you are to undertake. So that what must come to pass may unfold, I charge you with this task. Do your duty to the blood elves, but in the moment when Light is revealed to you, say nothing. Do not interfere._

Three companies of Blood Knights ride forth, resplendent on their chargers and glowing like crimson streaks in their finery as they cross the verdant plains of Eversong Woods. They ride like bolts of red fire through the grey ash of the Ghostlands, and a small unit of Forsaken joins up with them at Tranquillien. Ezra is attached as a special observer and arcanist, operating nominally under the command of the unit's CO.

The soldiers form a defensible camp on a rise above the stronghold of Dar'khan Drathir and his Scourge forces. Their camp-followers take charge of the horses, and the knights dismount to fight on foot. Not even the war-horses of the elves are hardened enough to fight against the Scourge in close quarters.

Spreading out into a skirmish formation, they descend into the Dead Scar and begin clearing a path through the mindless undead who still dwell in that forsaken place. Whatever was once flesh is put to the torch, and Ezra winces sympathetically as he watches.

Drathir's fortress is guarded in a more organized fashion. The Scourge there are taking orders from necromancers within, who have arranged a communication system that moves the undead about with an almost-living level of efficiency. Lacking the discipline problems of a living host, these undead would pose a serious threat to a conventional army. Only the paladins of the Blood Knights find themselves sufficiently equipped to battle this army of the Scourge, and even then not all of their number survive to the inner keep.

Within the inner most keep, perhaps a dozen paladins have been able to break through the Scourge's defenses - their comrades are still outside, holding off waves of abominations and zombies while the traitor can be destroyed.

Nobody present, least of all Ezra, anticipated what they actually find: a red dragon under some sort of sorcerous sway, the traitor Dar'khan Drathir himself, and a young peasant girl and assorted other creatures bound and tied over an enormous Scourge plague-cauldron.

"Korialstrasz! Strike them down!" commands the traitor. Ezra can 'see' the threads of magical energy connecting Dar'khan to the captives. No - to one of the captives. The peasant girl. Why should she have so much power?

As the paladins scatter before the dragon's assault, Ezra vanishes from sight and begins scuttling toward the captives. He is stopped short by a bolt of shadow power fired at his position by the sneering traitor. And Dar'khan, in turn, wheels to face another threat: Eitrigg himself, hefting an enormous battle-axe and leaping from the rafters. "Die, Scourge scum!"

Free now to concentrate, Ezra rallies his own sorcerous powers. A ward of sufficient strength should block the siphoning of energy that Dar'khan seems to be using. Ezra stretches out his hands. The arcane comes to his call. The channels of energy in his body and in the earth beneath him align, freeing him to call on the mystical power available in this place. The ward grows. Distracted by the need to avoid such a potent combatant, Dar'khan is not quite able to sustain it. The threads of power snap.

In desperation, Dar'khan calls out to his fellow blood elves. "You fools! She is the Sunwell incarnate! Do you understand? All our glory! We can have it back! Join me and regain our place in the world!"

And Ezra in shock looks up at the girl, whose face registers a wondrous continuum of emotion. Fright, fear, confusion, desperation. And after a moment, Ezra's keen eyes see what he least wanted to see in her expression. Recognition.

"Yes," she whispers. "I am the Sunwell. Not human, not Anveena, only great power. But power cannot be directed without will.." She stares across the faces arrayed for and against her in the keep: the paladins, Eitrigg, Dar'khan, the red dragon. Silence falls for a moment. And in that moment, Ezra can see the anguish of the blood elves. He feels their loss as it were his own. A simple betrayal and they could have it all back again.

A voice is heard. A shout - to the end of his life Ezra can never be sure just who it was. "She needs our help, brothers! Just kill the traitor and save these people!" In that moment, the Blood Knights are galvanized. Fists strengthen around sword hilts. The soldiers of Silvermoon stand straighter. Eitrigg punches Dar'khan in the face, sending him reeling into a knot of the paladins. Light - bright, brilliant Light - emerges from Anveena. The paladins raise their blades to receive it. It scintillates across their weapons, over their armor, through their eyes, into their blood. As one they strike through Dar'khan's sorcerous barrier, piercing it as though it were paper. The Scourge's elven commander gurgles, briefly, then falls very still.

The red dragon, now apparently free of the traitor's control, ceases to fight immediately. Eitrigg strides over to the captives and begins to free them, grinning. Ezra stands still, shock preventing him from doing much of anything. The naaru's warnings were unnecessary; whatever just happened here was not to be meddled with in any case.

"Ezra Pyreborn?" comes a voice. It's the dragon himself, a deep and resonant bass. Ezra looks up, tipping his hat with some modicum of self-awareness.

"The naaru predicted this meeting, and this event. How, I wonder," muses the dragon. When it becomes clear that the Forsaken has little to contribute, the creature lumbers out of the keep and takes wing, leaving the mage behind. And all that he can think is: _yes, but which naaru?_

Lady Liadrin has debriefed her knights and met with the captives brought back by the expedition. "The southern road is now clear," she announces at last, with Eitrigg and Ezra present. "I suppose that we cannot object to this notion of the overland route. And.. this business about the Sunwell. This bears a great deal of consideration."

One of the captives, a man named Jorad Mace, has been assured by his saviors that he is to be set free, despite being a human in elf lands - as long as he leaves. "I have seen great and wondrous things," he confides to Ezra as the wizard speaks to the captives in turn. "I believe... I believe in the power of the Light again. I could not have guessed at what would happen."

"They will need paladinss in the Plaguelandss," replies Ezra. "The Argent Dawn now fightss for all of humanity and on behalf of all the living againsst the Sscourge there, yess. You would do well to sspeak with them."

"I will. Tyri got away when we were captured. I'll protect her too, and everyone," vows Jorad with conviction.

A few of the Blood Knights have also been listening. "Lady Liadrin believes that having emissaries among the Argent Dawn would be useful," one explains gruffly. "We'll help to keep the pilgrims safe. If you are traveling that way, we will join you."

Eitrigg draws Ezra away. "I think we've accomplished our immediate goal here," he confides quietly. "Breaking the ties to the naga will be done in stages, and this was the first. I need you with the pilgrims. I'll go as far as the Plaguelands - hah, that fight with that skinny elf has fired up my blood again! I need a real battle to be satisfied. I imagine the Scourge will oblige me."

Ezra just smiles. And as Eitrigg leaves, he withdraws the seeker-compass from his pocket. The _Defiant_ and its crew are still far away. But maybe he will see them again soon at this rate.
