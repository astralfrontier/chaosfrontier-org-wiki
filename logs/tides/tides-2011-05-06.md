High Inquisitor Whitemane rides rapidly across the blasted desolation of the Plaguelands, forsaking some of the roads where she knows the Scarlet Crusade will be patrolling. More than once she is beset by the undead, sometimes a dozen or more at a time, but she does not hold her high station for being merely a pretty face. She leaves behind the Light-blasted remnants of such corpses as a warning, however futile, to the Scourge she so viciously hates.

Her horse she drives to exhaustion, using her healing magics to sustain it long past the point where its natural lifeforce might give out. Though the beast is driven frantic by the effort needed to sustain the pace she wants, she drives it nevertheless, as she has driven so many Crusaders in their holy war.

Somewhere behind her, she knows that the others will be coming. Brigitte, of course, with her soldiers; probably Doan, to restrain her. What of Renault?

---

The Chapel appears in the distance, still a tiny building on the outskirts of Browman's Mill. The picket sentries spot Whitemane approaching, recognize her livery, and shout out her presence as she draws nearer. At the doors of the chapel, and around the building, masses of people can be seen - living humans, as Whitemane recognizes them with relief after a brief twinge of terror. They seem to be reacting to her.

As she dismounts, Whitemane looks from face to face. Some former Crusaders - _traitors_, her mind suggests immediately - and some she doesn't recognize who wear the livery of the Argent Dawn. And then there is that other heraldry, adorning the crimson-cloaked elves over there. Another knightly order? Elves fighting the Scourge?

She sours as she sees another face, one familiar to her. A black-cloaked wizard with a broad-brimmed hat and bandages covering him. He spots her, tips his hat politely, and hobbles closer, supporting himself with an ornate cane crafted of crystal and bone.

"High Inquisssitor Whitemane, yess," wheedles Ezra. "It iss good to ssee you healthy and--"

"The chalice! The naga chalice. _You_ brought this curse to us!" shouts Whitemane. Ezra recoils, but she goes on. "If you hadn't destroyed the Scarlet Monastery, none of this would be happening! Die!"

Before she can act, though, a burly man with an eyepatch intervenes by physically stepping between the pair. "Guests of the Argent Dawn shall comport themselves with dignity," he says, in a calm voice that could still defeat a thunderstorm. "They shall not assault other guests. Am I clear, _Crusader_?"

"You are clear, Lord Tyrosus," whispers Whitemane. Satisfied, the man falls back a step.

Ezra hobbles forward to fill the space. His voice is softer, and more human, than Whitemane remembers it ever being. "I am ssorry for your loss. However.. the original naga plan, using Daniel Batess as a pawn, would have ensslaved all of you. You would now be under the thrall of the Old God Dagun, waging war on the ssurface racess - the ssame war which the Sscourge is prossecuting, yess. Do you wish that?"

"Do you expect me to believe that?" demands Whitemane vehemently.

"You would not be here, amongst your ideological enemiess, if ssomething ssimilar had not happened," Ezra points out craftily, thinking fast. "Sso. Has the naga chalice come to Tyr'ss Hand, then?"

Whitemane reels as though struck. Several seconds pass before she can regain her composure. "Yes," she whispers.

"Very well. Then we are obligated to asssisst you, yes." Ezra points east with his cane. "If they have already been conssumed by the power of the naga, there iss still hope for them. The 'grail'."

The woman feels a sense of vertigo. "They.. they can be cured?" she asks at last.

"Jusst so." Ezra smiles and gestures around him. "If thiss is what truly happened, then pleasse be at easse. We are prepared to help with thiss matter, if we can."

---

A defensive line has been formed around the Chapel. Depending on how many forces Tyr's Hand sent, there may be an actual battle - and the most heartbreaking kind of warfare in Lordaeron today, that of living man against living man.

Perhaps fifty soldiers of the Scarlet Crusade approach the site. They are armed for war, and led by Brigitte Abbendis, Doan, and Renault Mograine.

"You have the High Inquisitor, Sally Whitemane, in your custody," announces Abbendis, drawing her blade. "We command that you return her to us."

Maxwell Tyrosus walks forward calmly, until his eyepatch is within an inch of the tip of the outstretched sword. He looks up to the woman on her horse. "And if it is her wish that she stay?"

"Then we will fight you for her!" announces Abbendis.

Tyrosus digests this. And after a moment, he starts to laugh, and doesn't stop for half a minute. Abbendis, quaking with restrained fury, stares down at him. "Explain what's so funny!" she demands.

"Forgive me, my lady." Tyrosus composes himself. "But do you not know who stands before you? The high elves of Silvermoon City, whom Arthas himself could not destroy. The heroes who braved Naxxramas and returned, including one of the Crusade's own. Here stands Darion Mograine, wielder of the Ashbringer. Ezra Pyreborn, speaker to Titans and dragons. Rimblat Earthshatter of the Earthen Ring, the plagueshifter of renown. Even your quarry, Whitemane herself, is no mere priest." He pauses. "Tell me, my lady, who have you brought?"

Abbendis hesitates. "Dismount!" she calls, and sheathes her sword. "We will speak of this calmly. We have no quarrel with you, unless you protect this woman from justice she has earned."

"We will listen to what you say on this matter, and our judgement will be our own." Tyrosus gestures. "For now, if you come in peace, please be our guests."

The riders dismount and pass the sentry line unmolested. As they draw near the Chapel, however, three figures approach: Ezra Pyreborn, Whitemane, and Darion Mograine.

"Renault!" calls Darion, hefting the legendary sword Ashbringer before him. "We have heard from Fairbanks, and I have heard from our father's own spirit, the deed you did. How dare you come here asking for 'justice'?"

Abbendis' eyes flash between the brothers. "Our business is with her, not you!" she calls unsteadily.

As Whitemane steps toward Renault hesitantly, the Ashbringer rises of its own. "No- No, not now!" exclaims Darion, futilely trying to restrain the motion of the blade.

Everyone moves at once. To Ezra, the events play themselves out in slow motion, a diorama of revenge and loss almost frozen in time. The Ashbringer, still cursed with the hateful spirit of Alexandros Mograine, plunges for the heart of the patricide Renault. Abbendis screams. Doan begins to chant a spell. But before he can complete it, before Renault can even think to defend himself, Whitemane has hurled herself in the path of the cursed blade.

"Renault!" With her cry, blood spills across the weapon as it enters her back and goes hilt-deep. The tip emerges from Renault's back, as Sally and Renault are pinioned together in a last embrace.

Whatever crimes the young Mograine had committed, whatever sins he had failed to atone for, the act of sacrifice and love causes Ashbringer to radiate a blinding white light. And as Darion finally regains control of himself and with agonizing slowness manages it free of the pair, both Crusaders fall to the ground in a spreading pool of scarlet.

---

Whitemane awakes. Near her, the medics of the Argent Dawn are laboring over the fallen body of Renault Mograine. Though she is still in terrible pain, even with an active healing aura around most of her body, and without any strength left, she manages to direct her arm. Slowly it slides across the linen of the bed where she lays, her hand trying desperately to reach his.

She feels something else. Cloth of some kind. Bandages? But cold, not like the bed. It takes her hand, guides it into the cold clasp of another - a stronger hand. Renault's hand. Her eyes try to focus.

It's the mage - that undead mage. He guided her hand into Renault's. And now he steps back, and watches.

Over the next several hours, the healers exhaust themselves and must be carried away by their fellows, to be replaced by others. And in the end, what stops them is not a lack of manpower, nor a willingness to save another life. It's a whisper from Renault. "Let... me... die."

The body will not last when the soul is no longer willing to occupy it. And Renault Mograine, sinner, slayer of his own kin, whose life was filled with moments of weakness and doubt, and who used his last such failure to spare Whitemane the chalice, is gone.

Whitemane's final bits of strength leave her body. Hot tears roll from her eyes. It is the last thing she feels before losing consciousness again.

When she comes to again, she is still profusely bandaged. The Forsaken mage, Ezra Pyreborn, is kneeling nearby, reading a tome of some kind. He glances up, and reads her condition with his glowing eyes. "It iss.. not an easy thing, iss it?" he asks softly.

"What would you know?" Whitemane whispers. Her hand is shaky, but it obeys her wishes. She can at least clean the remaining tears from her eyes.

"My firsst friend, the commander of Undercity's expeditionary forcess." Ezra closes his book, looks at her. "My teacher of alchemical sstudiess. Thosse that are taken from me but not sslain. My wife. My daughter."

"Do you wish me to feel guilty over the destruction of the undead?" the woman asks weakly.

"No. I wissh for you to live. I wissh you whatever happiness you can sstill find in thiss world. And.. I am ssorry for your loss." Ezra rises. "Ah, about that man. Darion Mograine. The ssword - Ashbringer, yess - it took command of him. There wass no malice in hiss actions. Hiss father found vengeance from beyond the grave. Pleasse forgive Darion, who loved hiss father as much as.. as anyone can love anyone else."

"He didn't.. he couldn't.. Renault would never.." Whitemane is at a loss for words. She has heard the accusation, but to see the results of it leave her feeling adrift.

"He was tempted into it," Ezra explains. "Grand Crusader Ssaidan Dathrohan, yes. A demon in dissguise. He.. was used. Remember that."

"You mean _I_ was used," Whitemane whispers.

"Yess. That too." Ezra's cane clacks on the floor as he begins to depart. "Now you are free. A heavy burden to bear, yes. The people here will help you find a new way, if you let them." The undead creature manages one of his ghastly nigh-fleshless smiles. "You have a great power within you, my lady. The transcendent power of selfless love. Do not let it die. Use it in remembrance of the one you loved, and those others you may love in the future." And tipping his hat, he is gone.

---

The woman sits alone in her tent, contemplating the new tabard she wears. Rising from the wooden chair, she studies herself in the mirror for a moment. There is no vanity to the act. It is a moment of reflection, mind as well as body. And she steps forth.

Maxwell Tyrosus is waiting for her. "Brigitte Abbendis and Doan the Arcanist have been freed of the chalice's influence. They are still under guard. The men they brought - some where cursed, some were not. There is great unrest among them."

"I understand," the woman says softly. "I will speak with them."

"Do you think that you can help them? After all, you are High Inquisitor Whitemane, their--"

The woman smiles, and Tyrosus marvels at it. Something has definitely changed in her, he thinks.

"I am the High Inquisitor no longer, and... to be honest, I cannot be Whitemane any more. But I cannot simply walk away from the responsibility I bear. Will you accept me.." She pauses, thinking a moment. ".. as Paletress?"

Tyrosus breaks into a grin. "I will. If you will accept us in the Argent Dawn as your new comrades." He offers her a hand, and Paletress accepts with a bright smile.
