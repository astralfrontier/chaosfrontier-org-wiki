A magical message from Dalaran has arrived for Light's Hope Chapel. It is addressed to "Ezra Pyreborn, or other opponents of the naga invasion". Naturally, Ezra claims it.

"More counter-chalices are being produced by the foundry," it announces. "A shipment of them will be teletransported to your location, based on reports about widespread human infection in the Plaguelands. Please also advice on effectiveness against humans infected by the plague of undeath, if such information becomes available."

Ezra snorts, but passes the message along to the Argent Dawn's leadership. Another message which follows shortly is of far more interest.

"Announcing the Covenant of the Chalice." Ezra scans further. "Delegates from the major factions with the Horde, along with Moonglade's night elves and assorted secular and militant orders on Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms, have agreed to a mutual non-aggression pact, and the formation of an order to be called the Covenant of the Chalice. Heraldic symbols enclosed."

"Members of the Covenant, identified by these symbols, may approach without fear of retribution... Positions of leadership to be.." Ezra mumbles to himself, then finds a phrase which draws a hearty laugh from his dessicated throat. "Arcane Advisor: Ezra L. Pyreborn." He snorts. "Nobody assked me. Typical, yess."

He is interrupted by the arrival of Eitrigg. "Still here, Ezra?" the orc asks.

"Yess. Sseveral of my sstudents in the Ssacred Fire have made their way here." The wizard gestures out to the field behind the chapel, where a number of undead, a handful of Broken, and other beings are gathered. They form a motley assortment, but they seem in high spirits.

"What is this business, anyway?" Eitrigg asks. "I've heard some rumors of this."

Ezra steeples his fingers. "There iss a power within each of uss, yess. Thiss power calls out to other power around it, unifies with it, directss it. For ssome, this is called the Holy Light. It behavess in a certain manner because its adherentss expect that it will. But the Horde will never accept the Light, because of itss associationss with the Alliance, yes. Desspite this, the naaru - allies of the draenei, whom you know - hold that a benevolent union of forcess is the only hope we have againsst threatss such as the Burning Legion. Thuss, it becomess crucial to involve the Horde in their program. The Sacred Fire iss a tradition which appeals to the Horde's ssensibilitiess."

Eitrigg grunts. "So you're going to fool us into becoming paladins, eh?" he asks slyly. Ezra chuckles in response. "Not paladinss, no. The virtuess of the Horde, the oath we took, these things musst remain - indeed, they _must_ be followed for thiss power to resspond to uss. But, we may develop our own powerss appropriate to our natures. Ssome warriorss already do so. For example, Eitrigg, your combat prowess is well-nigh ssupernatural. It musst be that you have accessed ssome of this potential power you hold without conssciously realizing it."

Eitrigg grunts again. But like all orcs, his nonverbal expressions are more deeply nuanced than most humans recognize. Ezra has learned to recognize the subtlety: the old orc is giving this some actual thought.

"Interesting," he concludes at last. "Does this have anything to do with the naga, or this new weapon you've been working on?"

Ezra nods. "Part of it wass inspired by the achievement of the naga we have converted with the grails, yess. They were able to ssummon the willpower to throw off the yoke of an Old God. Obvioussly this iss of great interesst to the Forssaken for our own reasons. It iss also true that we Forssaken have been experimenting with perssonal transsformation for ssome time, following the examples the Sscourge has set. It iss vital that we have a framework for undersstanding thiss power, and using it in a proper fashion. I do not know if this was part of the Titans' planss for this world, nor do I care. The world iss ours now, and we musst keep it ssafe."

Eitrigg rumbles as he listens. "Interesting," he says again. "The orcs have always valued their honor. To us, creatures who lack honor are seen as defective, or weak, meant to be conquered and taught through force. What you're describing sounds more like temptation - the promise of power in exchange for honorable behavior."

"It might be," concedes Ezra. "I think of it as the promisse of hope, the promisse of a miracle in livess wholly devoid of ssuch luxuries. I do not tempt with power. Insstead of force, I believe that exemplarss of virtue may sset an example to their fellowss, and that the Sacred Fire will give them the power to defend that virtue."

"I hope you can find such champions of virtue, even in the face of despair," smiles Eitrigg. "This world needs such heroes."

Tirion and Taelan Fording approach the picket sentries guarding the Chapel.

"Who goes there?" calls the sentry.

"Tirion Fordring, exile," the older man answers. "I come seeking Darion Mograine, or his kin."

"Come through," the sentry shouts, after a few moments.

As the Fording father and son ride closer to the chapel, they spot two figures. One is a heavily bandaged Forsaken clad in black; the other is an older orc, sporting an impressive axe. "I know that orc!" shouts Tirion, spurring his horse forward.

He dismounts in a swift motion, landing heavily on booted feet, and strides forward. "It's you!"

Eitrigg's hand is on his axe before he can consciously react, but as he sees who is visitor is, a look of shock washes over his features. And then he laughs, so hard that even the distant acolytes of the Sacred Fire turn to see what the disturbance is.

"Ha! To see your ugly pink face in this place," bellows Eitrigg, tusks prominent in an orc's version of a grin. "Well well well!"

Tirion eyes the orc carefully, glancing about him. The Forsaken creature is staring with glowing eyes, and nearby, a massive tauren is deep in conversation with a night elf. But most of the people at the Chapel are human.

"What are you doing here?" he asks carefully.

Eitrigg lifts a scroll from his pocket and presents it. "Ambassador from the Warchief to Silvermoon City," he proclaims. "And what of you, brave knight?"

"Knight no longer," Tirion answers. Something makes him pause. "Or.. Knight of the Silver Hand no longer. I think I have a new calling, though I must still find it."

Eitrigg nods soberly. "Then come! I challenge you to a contest of honor, in a matter where only one of us will be left standing."

---

The Chapel has been operating as a makeshift inn for some time. Now the center table is littered with steins, glasses, mugs and any other vessel that will hold liquor.

"Thish man!" bellows an extremely drunken Eitrigg. "I shtrapped him to his horse! To his _horse_! A prettier face on that horsh than on thish man, I tell you!" And he reaches for an enormous dwarven stein, taking another long drink from it.

"You.. you were the one whose axe was .. stuck in that wall," retorts Tirion, equally in his cups, thumping the table with a mailed fist. "You were... hahah, you were cursing at it! Stupid orc. You were begging your axe to come free of that stonework, telling it how your honor was on the line and how it was disgracing all your ancestors.... it came out all right. Right into your leg!"

"I meant to do that!" roars Eitrigg. "The blood rage makes an orc fight harder!"

The rest of the Chapel's regulars watch with a mixture of amusement, fear, and gratitude. For awhile, their fears and sorrows are forgotten. And finally, as both combatants have fallen prey to their mutual adversary Alcohol, they are hauled unceremoniously to cots and laid out to sleep it off. Argent Confessor Paletress leans over each of the sleepers, kissing them on the forehead, and whispers a spell of healing and soothing to make the eventual awakening bearable.

As the watch rotation begins with the coming of midnight, Ezra sits alone on the chapel roof, and looks up at the stars. Azeroth's twin moons lazily circle the planet, and beyond them, the endless twinkling lights.

_Ezra,_ comes a voice. The wizard rouses himself. This he recognizes as O'ros, the naaru whom the draenei have served and protected.

_Your work here is done. It is time to rejoin your friends. They will have need of you. Soon there will be a messenger who will need your help in their travels. You will assist this messenger, for doing so will return you to where you are most needed now._

The wizard smiles a bit. "I am not a sservant of the Holy Light, you know," he points out. "I do not take ssuch orderss easily."

_You are a servant of a power just as important,_ O'ros replies. _Whatever its name and whatever form it takes for you, you have always been true to it. I do not command you; I give you information. And I say one more thing to you, a message to the dwarves._

"What is it?" Ezra asks, curious.

_It is this. Their creators, the Titans, were and are creatures of order and stability. But stability precludes growth and change, virtues which are naturally a part of any truly living thing. The dwarves would do well, before seeking to call their creators back to this world, to remember that perhaps the Titans left for good reason - to allow their creations to grow into their potential._

---

The draenei present within the ranks of the Argent Dawn were never fully accepted as equals. Potent warriors and talented spellcasters, to be sure - but as good as humans, or fit to sit at the same table and eat and drink and laugh like comrades?

The arrival of blood elves has caused some of these simmering tensions to explode into full-blown confrontations. All that the draenei know of these creatures is their exposure to the saboteurs of the Exodar and the subsequent loss of draenei life in the crash-landing.

A brawl has erupted in the training fields the Argent Dawn has erected. As Tirion Fordring approaches, he can hear the shouts of combatants. Nobody is armed with anything really sharp - yet - but it's only a matter of time before someone is seriously wounded. He rushes forward.

He forcibly separates a draenei from two of his blood elf attackers, hauling back and punching the blue bruiser squarely in the face. When the elves move to join in, he kicks the knees out from one of them and hoists the other to his shoulders, then drops him to the ground.

Others he separates and "pacifies", and as he moves from brawl to brawl, the human knights of the Argent Dawn are inspired by his example. They move in with only a trace of reluctance, pulling apart the fighters and in many cases physically restraining them.

"The Lich King is laughing at us!" bellows Tirion, surveying the wounded and bruised. "He's _laughing_. At _us_. What fools we are, to fight amongst ourselves, when the enemy is so close, and so ready to take away what little we have left! You there!" He points at one of the blood elves. "You know someone lost to the Scourge, don't you." The elf, breathing heavily, finally manages a nod. "You also. And you and you.." Finally he sighs. "You, blood knight. Tell us of your fallen."

The elf looks about. Eyes are upon him. But there's no fighting, not right now. "My name is Luthas," he begins. "My wife, Tisani, and her best friend ..."

The stories come, one by one. Blood elves, then humans, briefly recount what they have lost to the Scourge. And in time, Tirion begins eliciting stories from the draenei too: "Tell me of the comrades you've lost in your fighting."

By the time that Maxwell Tyrosus has heard the news and had time to ride to the training field, the former fighters are helping each other up, whispering words of encouragement to those whose sad tales knit together a mass of angry beings. And he learns in hushed tones from one of the senior men present just who and how the conflict was resolved.

Riding to Tirion as the exiled knight is packing up his water-flask and bags, the one-eyed commander smiles. "You're the real thing, Tirion Fordring. We need men like you. Men for whom the Light isn't a gift from a politician or priest, but for whom it is a calling. Will you stay with us?"

Tirion wipes sweat from his brow and looks up, silent and unmoving for a moment. Then a grin spreads across his face. "If you have a use for this old man, I'd feel a villain to refuse." The offer is sealed with a hearty handshake, and Tirion continues. "I don't suppose you know where I can find Darion Mograine, do you? He seems to have disappeared."

Tyrosus nods. "That he did. Darion will never be a paladin, I think. He has his own path. He said he's going to ride south, find some men - maybe in the Hillsbrad area, maybe some survivors in Alterac or the Arathi highlands - and keep the hill lands free of naga."

Tirion's smile tinges itself with a faint trace of regret. "Well. He's a good young man. His father would be proud of him."

"Aye. And I think it safe to say that he's leaving his father's legacy in good hands," remarks Tyrosus.

"How's that?" asks the other man.

"He left a gift for you. For you, specifically. He said you were the rightful holder now, that he somehow knew it'd turn out well."

Tirion snorts. "Are you going to keep me in suspense? Spit it out, man."

Tyrosus chuckles softly. "Well.. if you must know, it's a sword. Tirion Fordring, you are the new wielder of the Ashbringer."
