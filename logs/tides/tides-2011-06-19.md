Light's Hope Chapel has seen many wonders. Among them are the draenei: the visitors from a far-off world who nevertheless bring news of the Light, and have consented to send a few of their number to aid the beleagured soldiers of the Argent Dawn.

Another recent wonder is the 'grail': a magical cup or chalice so enchanted as to reverse the effects of Dagun's curse on the naga, or their victims. Several such artifacts have recently arrived at the Chapel courtesy of one of Dalaran's mages. They are being produced in a foundry on Purgation Isle, and the magical city has consented to at least begin distributing them.

Maxwell Tyrosus brings these wonders together in a meeting with Kom the Dissident, leader of the draenei expeditionary force to the Plaguelands, and a few hand-picked subordinates. The old soldier explains: Tyr's Hand must be cleansed, of course. But many of the southern lands will need this blessing as well. Someone must carry the grails south. If it will not be Dalaran, then it must be someone else. "And it would be good for your people to have more exposure to other members of the Alliance and its people," adds Tyrosus. "Do you have an emissary in mind?"

Kom grins. "I do, at that," he answers, calling for his chosen to step forward.

Kaliera steps forwards, making a formal reverence. "Greetings, Lord Tyrosius. I am the Anchorite Kaliera, representing the Hand of Argus by the blessing of the Holy Light and the Naaru."

Tyrosus nods. "Very well. One of our visitors has volunteered to perform the gate ritual to carry you south. He's got business there as well, so you'll be traveling together." He gestures; a black-clad figure waiting in the back steps forward, tipping his hat politely. He looks human enough, but bald and pale. "If you're a draenei, you may need no introduction," Tyrosus adds. "This is Ezra Pyreborn."

Kaliera bows again. "I have heard many things of the revered Pyreborn," she says with a small smile.

"You'll find the grails stacked outside," adds Tyrosus. "Travel safe."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "anything you feel like gettin done here? if so, go for it. when ready we'll portal to IF."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "nope. She's ready to go."

Men of the Argent Dawn gather in a circle as instructed. Ezra, after consulting a small compass he carries with him, decides on Dun Morogh as his next destination. "Our aim may be off," he cautions. "We'll do short hops after that if so." But the ritual begins, powered by a powerstone the wizard carries and by the devotional chanting of the Dawn's men. In a few minutes, a gate blossoms into existence.

Gesturing at the box of grails causes the whole thing to begin levitating. Ezra guides it through, then bows politely. "After you, my friend."

Kaliera watches carefully. She is unfamiliar with this particular sort of magic, but it could be useful to learn someday! She bows politely in response, and travels through, staff in hand. (It never hurts to be ready.)

The other side of the portal is a snowy forest. "There we are," remarks Ezra, pointing at a far-off mountain. "I can see the gates from here. One more hop..." And so a second gate opens, and the pair are left on a road leading high up to the well-guarded Gates of Ironforge.

Kaliera looks up the hill, and at the gates. "I had though the Exodar to be magnificent, but the skill to make those gates is exceptional," she admits, breath visible in the cool air.

Ezra starts to hobble his way up the hill, supporting himself with his cane. "Dwarves are proud creatures, proudest of their works," he agrees.

The road is well-traveled in both directions, but any unexpected travelers are stopped as a matter of course. "Who goes there?" says a bearded and armored dwarf, his voice dull with the habit of routine - there's nothing too exceptional about a human and draenei traveling to Ironforge.

Kaliera says, "I have met a few, who have come to the Exodar, and the Chapel. Very interesting. And their beer is also quite good." She bows to the guard. "I am the Anchorite Kaliera, and this is the revered Ezra Pyreborn, with a delivery from the Light's Hope Chapel.""

> (OOC) Sookie is merely honored at this point.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Guild rep."

"Got papers-" begins the guard, but his partner steps forward. "Hold on. I heard that name before. Ezra Pyreborn. Ain't he supposed to be Forsaken?" The dwarf peers suspiciously at the very human-looking mage. "Who are ye, really?"

Kaliera reaches into a pouch slung on a strap over one shoulder and across her chest... reaches into it up to her elbow, a bit more than should obviously be there, rummaging and pulling out a set of smaller pouches marked in Draenish, a flask, a bottle marked in Dwarven, and then finally some papers.

Ezra just smiles, fingering his cane. "I am he that uncovered Bael Modan, and protected the dwarves there from the first outbreak of the curse of Dagun. I am he that spoke to the living Titan, Aggramar, Maker of Dwarves." He imitates for a moment, as best he is able, the words and pronounciation of the Titan the party met in its travels. "I am the only living native speaker of this tongue, and the message I bring is not to be ignored. If my companions do not already have the ear of your King, then it is only because they have not yet arrived." He pauses. "I can _show_ you that I am Forsaken. Is it truly a sight you wish to see?"

"Hold on, hold on," says the second guard. "No call for _that_. Just gimme a moment..." The guard looks over Kaliera's paperwork, actually _reading_ it rather than the cursory glance guards usually give such things. Finally he says, "Well, looks like things're in order. If yer really Ezra, yer companions _have_ got here. Want me ta take ye there?"

"If you please," says the wizard, mollified once again.

Kaliera busies herself putting the things back in her pouch, putting the papers on top, but the dwarven stout just underneath.

Kaliera then bows to the guard. "Your assistance is much appreciated. I have never visited Ironforge before."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "bear with me, trying to figure out the best way to pose forward"

"Well, welcome then, lass," says the dwarf, peering up at the tall draenei. "I hope ye find the place to yer likin'." He escorts the pair out of the chill air of high Dun Morogh and into the heat of Ironforge.

As the three pass along the bustling streets, the dwarf says, "Well, from all I hear, yer friends've been busy of late. Savin' cities from the naga, unearthin' Titan ruins... but probably best if they tell ye all about it themselves."

> (OOC) Nerai is semi-idle to eat.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "D'oh."

Kaliera is an obvious gawker right now. She's got enough sense to not walk into anyone, but she's oohing and aahing over the construction of the city.

"Yes, that'd be them," muses Ezra. "No infection here, I hope?"

"Nay," says the guard. "Not many of our cities are that close to water, exceptin' Dun Garok an' Thelsamar, and they hain't seen any murlocs or naga anywhere near Loch Modan, thank the gods."

> (OOC) Nerai sorryes.

Ezra nods approvingly. "Lucky you. Building in the mountains was wise for that reason. Though there may be an Old God of Stone, and you'll be at the center of it..." He shakes his head, dismissing the thought.

"Ach, don't even talk about it," says the guard. "With our luck, the troggs'll end up bein its minions just like them murlocs serve Dagun... Ah, we're here."

To accomodate Nerai and her equipment, the adventurers have moved nearer to Tinkertown, where the apartments are more likely to have an adjoining work shop. Though it has undergone many changes since they last parted ways, Ezra readily recognizes the outlines of Eecee in the garage. Eecee's mistress seems to be absent at the moment, but a dwarven tinker is busily adjusting the linkages to a newly installed weapon mount.

> (OOC) Nerai poses in

Kaliera bows to the guard. "Thank you most kindly, sir."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "The dwarf is Rolf Feuer, of course."

Nerai , however, isn't as absent as might first seem. As per her normal self, she is tucked into Eecee during the work, her normal suit of armor becoming almost a prison as she looks up, "Yes yes..' She says, the she smiles, "Ezra!" She exclaims, and struggles agains the various wires in Eecee. It takes her a moment to free herself, and she comes running at the Forsaken, ne. Human.

> (OOC) Nerai says, "I assume Nerai would recognize Ezra's human form."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "you've seen it before so yes"

Ezra tips his hat politely. "Good to see you again. Everyone else survived?"

Nerai nods, "More or less, more or less. New faces moreso than old. What are you doing in town. Who's your friend?"

Ezra gestures at Kaliera. "She is delivering grails to those who need it. I think it's best if we take her on our travels, since we'll be going to such places anyway."

Kaliera bows. "I am the Anchorite Kaliera, serving the Hand of Argus and the Alliance by the blessing of the Holy Light and the grace of the Naaru."

Nerai nods to Kalirea, "I'm Nerai. This is Eecee," Gestures to the armor; "And this si Rolf, my mentor." She sayes, with ovbious reverence as she gestures to the dwarf, "I'm sure Saeren would love to meet her." Nerai nods. "A pleasure to meet you."

Kaliera bows to Eecee as well. (One never knows.)

"So yer the famous Ezra Pyreborn," says Rolf as he shakes hands. "Heard so much about ye. And welcome to ye as well, miss," he says to Kaliera. "Heard a lot about the draenei. Never met one in the flesh, 'afore now."

Kaliera bows to Rolf, then offers her hand to shake. "I have met some dwarves, at the Chapel, as well as some from the Explorer's League who have come to the Exodar. I honor their inquisitiveness."

Rolf laughs in delight. "Aye, always askin' questions, that's us. Sorry the others aren't here at the moment - they're out on the town right now. Somethin' about... teachin' Sookie ta dance? Couldn't quite figure that one out, meself."

"Ah, yes, the elemental creature." Ezra rubs his hands together. "I anticipate that meeting. But for now.. is Ironforge committed to the war on the naga?"

Nerai smiles at Ezra, "They're coming around. As per usual it took some pursuasion, but nothing that wasn't handled pretty clearly." She shrugs and looks at the ground, "Should should meet Sookie at some time. Though I'm not sure of what help you can be at this point..." She trails off.

The guard, who has been hanging around out of curiosity, speaks up. "We already got a team workin' on the Aggramar Catalyst formula, an' we're sendin' people ta the northern human lands on the shorelines ta help defend 'em. Focusin' on Menethil Harbor, seein' as how they're one of the major ports." He shakes his head. "I hear we been havin' some kinda trouble with Stormwind, though."

"I expected as much," muses Ezra. "What's this business about a formula?"

Kaliera listens quietly, absorbing the information and making a mental list of things to ask about later.

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Formula?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "the guard's quote"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "The Aggramar Catalyst came with a formula for making more, beyond the crystals recovered in Uldaman. It's in a technical dialect of Titan, and still being deciphered."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "yeah. and I'm askin the dwarves ICly about it :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "If Nerai doesn't want to cover it, I will."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "You probably should, cause I think I missed that chapter."

"It's somethin' yer friends dug up in Uldaman," says the guard. "It's supposed to help turn naga inta... what is it, I heard the word... anyway, it's kinda like these here grails, only more powerful." The dwarf gestures to the crate Kaliera is carrying.

Kaliera says, "Is there a place I can put this down?"

Nerai gestures around, "The hangar is fairly safe."

Ezra hums to himself. "I should see more about this then." Slipping his hand into his pocket, he pulls out a thick envelope and presents it to the guard. "This is for your King. The Covenant of the Chalice. The Horde have begun to organize, but members of the Alliance are welcome. A neutral banner under which enemies of Dagun may operate. Please convey this to him."

"Aye," says the guard, placing the envelope in his pouch. "I'll pass it along to the Earthen Ring as well. They've got emissaries in the city now. The sooner we get everyone on the same page, the safer I'll feel, I know that much."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "okay. GM, barring action from anyone else, let's go see the guys working on the formula"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Sounds good."

Kaliera puts the box down carefully, and then prepares to follow.

> (OOC) TidesGM will cover the transition then

The guard escorts Ezra and his companions on the short walk to the Hall of Explorers, passing them through the heavily guarded wing that houses the tablets from Uldaman. Inside, one wall has been devoted to an alchemical laboratory, and runners come and go, carrying books from public libraries as well as the private grimoires of the Explorer alchemists. The tablets are carefully arranged on tables in the middle, with enormous magnifying glasses to help study them in detail.

The linguist Chomsky wanders over. "Hello there! You've brought us more experts, I take it?" He peers at Ezra. "Say, you look familiar."

It takes Ezra a few moments. "The gnome. Ah yes, I remember you now. Did you receive my notes on Titan?"

"_Your_ notes?" says the gnome, sounding bewildered. "Who _are_ you, then? I'm sorry, tip of my tongue, I'll get it in a moment..."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "He won't."

"Ezra Pyreborn," the wizard finally prompts. "Chomsky. Yes, you were at Bael Modan, yes?"

Kaliera finds herself distracted by the notes on what the tablets say.

Ezra follows his companion's glance. "What is this about anyway?"

Nerai shrugs, "You know my head for Titan. They found somethign when we went back into on of their vaults, though."

Kaliera says, "I should try to learn some," quietly, almost to herself. "It may be important in the future.""

The gnome startles visibly. "_Ezra?_ But you're..." He puts his hand to his face. "Oh yeeaaaah... I remember that story now. Well, congratulations on the flesh and blood, or something." He leads Ezra over to the tablets. "It's amazing! This substance your friends found... it'll transform any water that touches it so that it'll dispel Dagun's curse." He takes one of the view-glasses and moves it over part of the tablet. "According to this passage, the tablets here contain the formula they used to make the catalyst. Someone like you, Ezra, is just the person we need. A head for magic _and_ a knack for Titan... maybe you can help us sort out this technical jargon."

Nerai shrugs, "Learning how phlogiston creates energy by being captured and sombusted in a controlle denvironment then processed through an induction coil is important too, but we all have our talents."

"Of course," Chomsky goes on, "_then_ we'll probably have to replicate a bunch of Titan technology to actually _make_ the stuff, but one thing at a time." The gnome grins at Nerai. "And maybe someone like _you_ can help us with that bit."

Nerai raises an eyebrow, "How much are you gonna pay?" She asks, letting the question hang for just half a secnd, "Just kidding..."

Chomsky laughs. "And I was just about to ask who abducted you and replaced you with a goblin, too."

"Right!" Ezra clasps his hands together. "I'll take care of this. Who is in charge here? You, Chomsky?"

Kaliera says, "If I may offer my services as well, in addition to my training in the Light, I also have studied the alchemical arts."

Nerai says, "They're dwarves, Ezra. Everyone is in charge.""

Chomsky shakes his head. "I'm not in charge - not really an organizer. I'm just one of the lead linguists, seeing as how I'm the continent's second biggest expert on collloquial Titan. You want to talk to Magellas." Another dwarf has moved to join the newcomers, and he touches his hand to his brow. "High Explorer Magellas, at your service. You're the famous Ezra Pyreborn, then? Just tell me what you need."

"I need some assistants," the wizard replies. "Go back to Tinkertown. You'll find a crate of grails there, brought by Kaliera here. Fetch two." He gestures at the formulae. "I believe that the fundamental forces enacted upon the grails must be the same as this Catalyst, since they have the same origin. We'll use a working example of the same process to resolve unanswered questions."

Turning to the draenei, Ezra continues. "Not only your knowledge of alchemy, but of the Light, will be useful here. The transformation does not come alone from the grail, but from the inner fire of a living being. This same power underlies what you call the Light, and I think your insights will prove necessary here."

Kaliera says, "I shall do as needed, for we must work as one to overcome our foes."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "alright! GM, do we have enough to get started?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Yup. You aren't going to crack the /whole/ thing today, but you'll gain valuable insights. Get to posing while I work out what those insights are. ^\_^"

Tossing his coat and hat aside, Ezra gets to work with his fellows. And he has so much to work with. From Kaliera, the wisdom of alchemy from a world entirely unlike Azeroth, and a lifetime steeped in the Light and all its virtues. From Chomsky, hard experience learning the language of the Titans without the benefit of direct exposure, and insights that Ezra's extrapolations from a single conversation have failed to catch. From Nerai, a working practical knowledge of chemistry and the mundane sciences, which have as much to say about the behaviors of strange materials as any alchemist's formulary. From the dwarves, a passion for the art of craftsmanship, and the patience of centuries.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "if you guys have stuff to pose in here, get it rollin as well ;)"

Kaliera also brings to the table a priest's organization, and perhaps surprisingly, a skill at note-taking and organizing the knowledge and ideas that go around, so that they are not lost.

Nerai doesn't have much to do yet, she watches Ezra and the dwarves work. Her time is more the execution than the plannig, but she does pull out a sheet of paper and begin doodling some designs.

The secret to the grails is that they offer the subject a _choice_. The word 'catalyst' is well translated. Ezra is proceeding on the theory that what the grails and their antecedents, the chalices of Dagun, really do is to carry potential energy to the subject and allow his own inner fire to connect to it. From there the physical transformation is a side-effect of the spiritual one, as excess magical energies spill out into the drinker's body. In the case of the naga, Ezra remembers enough about the Sundering - and explains this to Kaliera, the only being who hasn't lived with this broken planet since birth - to realize that the choice the naga originally made was probably their own, albeit one born from desperation. Azshara must have petitioned Dagun or one of his subordinate beings - for the Highborne needed to transform, or perish.

> (OOC) Sookie bootstraps IC knowledge closer to player knowledge here, to save time :D

> (OOC) Sookie says, "need more time, GM?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Almost got it. Just need a few moments more to organize my thoughts."

> (OOC) Sookie goes for one more then!

Accordingly, Ezra busies himself with the translation of the text, and asks the others to connect one of the grails to some of the instruments in the lab. He dispatches a messenger to the Earthen Ring, asking for their assistance too: they most certainly have a stake in this matter, and they may have some insight that even this group lacks.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "And I've got it. And it dovetails nicely with what you've got there."

When the messenger returns, one of the Wildhammer shaman is with him, along with one other: the Hydraxian emissary, Tidemist. "I am intrigued by this Catalyst of which you speak," says the water elemental. "May I observe a sample?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "more"

One of the precious crystals is presented to the water-being, and he studies it intently, his form glowing faintly where it touches the Catalyst. Returning the sample, he speaks. "The element of water is the element of change, of transformation, and of cleansing. In the crafting of your more primitive grails, you have already observed the necessity of our element in their construction, just as the naga discovered this in crafting their twisted variation."

"If you would comprehend the nature of this substance," continues Tidemist, "you must commune with the elements. The Makers understood this when they bound our kind to the natural cycles of the world."

"Fire is.. more my focus right now," admits Ezra. "If not you, is there one who can assist us in this?"

Nerai hrms, "There might be someone.. yeah..."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "What do you have in mind, Nerai? Because I have somewhere I can go with this."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Sookie?"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Or am I off base?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Sookie may have a role to play in the plotline. However, I've got a specific quest."

> (OOC) Sookie defers to GM

The water elemental's voice lowers. "There is a secret we have kept from the mortal races since the Ordering," says Tidemist. "The binding of the elements to the world has physical form. There are altars throughout the world, of Titan construction, that are intended to remind us of the natural role of the elements - a role that we had forgotten in the madness of the Old Gods. Most of the altars to the element of Water are deep in the ocean, defended by the water giants. However, there are some that are near enough to the shore. One such lies far to the south, near the shores of a place you call Stranglethorn."

> (OOC) Nerai Just delete my pose then, that's fine.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "It's fine where it is, Nerai."

Ezra listens carefully, but doesn't question - yet.

Kaliera takes her notes, carefully, because this should be kept.

"The site is known to mortals as the Altar of Naias," continues Tidemist. "Though its true nature is not known, it has been identified as a place where the element of water is strong. Bring your experts on Titan lore to this place, and you may learn something of the relationship between the Titans and my kind. This knowledge may, perhaps, be of service in constructing more of this Catalyst."

"I can open a gate within the hour," declares Ezra.

Magellas speaks up. "The Altar of Naias? We've heard of the place, sure enough. I'll send a runner to go get the maps, so you can get a fix on the location."

> (OOC) Sookie has a Cunning Plan.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Need anything more from me?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "actually yes"

Ezra steeples his fingers, and regards the elemental Tidemist for a moment. "This creature Sookie, whom I have heard of," he announces, almost casually. "A fusion of human and elemental power. How was this done? How did you do it?"

Tidemist says gravely, "By her own testimony, she was created by the experiments of the Twilight's Hammer. The Hydraxians do not know which elementals participated in the experiments, but there have always been elementals who were eager to return to the days of the Old Gods, when we acted without restraint."

"I see." Ezra smiles some more. "And.. what of her then? Does she act without restraint, or does she adhere to the ordered structure of the elemental hierarchy, the _varkotha tuka_, the Nobility of the Four Forces?"

"Kagarn could answer your question better than I," says Tidemist. "I am told, however, that she is bound to Kagarn in his capacity as a member of the Earthen Ring. She does not act without restraint, but her restraint is not formally bound to the _varkotha tuka_."

This gets Ezra to his real question. "But _should_ she be bound, in your opinion?"

"She is both human and elemental," replies the Hydraxian emissary. "The mortal races are beyond the hierarchy. If she were bound strictly to the _varkotha tuka_, she would be bound to act wholly as an elemental, and her human nature would rebel against it. If she were unbound wholly, she would act as a human, but her elemental nature would run wild. _I_ would prefer that she would live as an elemental, but it would be perilous for me to deny her humanity."

Ezra listens, nodding along. "Very well. There are two elements in play here," he explains. "The first is that those transformed by the grail become not Highborne - as they were originally - but something new. The lamia. The orcish race drank demon's blood. They repented of this, but I am told that on Draenor, orcs are not green. They live forever changed by this. Water is both the element of change and of restoration. I have seen enough of Kagarn's healing magics to witness this. But if this catalyst is a transformation into some new state, not a restoration of the old, we can rule out seventeen of the thirty-four basic alchemical series, the _toshiyo_ class of hybrid reagents, and.." He lapses into a bit more technical jargon for a few moments, then resumes. "But there is something else."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "more"

"There is another matter. We, the mortal races of Azeroth, must be ready to assume the guardianship of this world." He gestures around him. "You see arrayed before you aliens to this world, bitter enemies, the living and the dead. At this moment, we are working in concert - we have proved that we can work together for the sake of our shared world. And so my message to your Duke Hydraxis, and to Neptulon the Tidehunter, and to all the other elementals is this: we are your partners now. Your allies. Do not keep secrets from us that will help us both. That you have already come forward with news of the Altar shows that you acknowledge the wisdom of my request. I ask merely that you formalize it."

Tidemist regards Ezra impassively, but nods. "These are desperate times. Our Duke Hydraxis sees the wisdom in the _varkotha tuka_, in accepting restraint in exchange for harmony. It has been a long time, beyond all mortal memory, since we have dealt with mortals such as the Earthen Ring that were worthy of the trust you request of us. Just as the so-called 'civilized' mortals have relearned the value of what you call a 'shaman', so we are relearning the value of working with mortals. In return for _your_ request, I ask patience of you and your kind, as we reforge the ancient relationship that this world had long forgotten."

Ezra nods slowly. "It must be done. Thank you."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone else have anything?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "not here. I've got a bit more business. lemme chase down Brann"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "since if I ask 'hey who would know about talking to the Titans' I'd probably hear his name"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Brann doesn't usually loiter around Ironforge very long, possibly for fear someone'll try to stick a crown on him. If you really /need/ to talk to him, you'll have to convince the Explorer's Guild you won't tell where he is, and you'll catch him packing."

> (OOC) Sookie will go do that then

> (OOC) Sookie says, "you got it, or do I?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I'll go for it."

---

> (OOC) Sookie says, "anyone else is welcome along :D"

> (OOC) Nerai is porbably going to try and finish up Eecee before you get us run out of town.

There's one more person Ezra wants to talk to, but he's a hard man to find. Even High Explorer Magellas claims that Brann has already left town. Only when he can get Ezra alone does Chomsky acknowledge that the famous explorer is still somewhere in Ironforge. "I'll take you to him, but you've got to promise you won't tell anyone where he is."

"My knowledge would be quickly obsolete anyway," points out Ezra. "Just get on with it."

Kaliera has gone back to the garage/apartments, and for want of anything else to do has begun doing.... housework. Cleaning. Straightening. Dusting. It is entirely possible that some cooking may occur.

The gnome leads Ezra to a small inn far away from the Explorer's Hall, where Brann is already kneeling on the last of his suitcases to strap it shut. "Ah, Chomsky. Good ta see ya. Come ta see me off, or perhaps ta join me? An' who's this ye got with ya?"

The wizard tips his hat. "Ezra L. Pyreborn, at your service sir."

"Ah!" says the dwarf, hopping off the bed. The suitcase snaps open behind him, but he doesn't seem to notice. "Now _yer_ a man I don't mind seein'. What can I do for ye?"

"You have been referred to me as an authority on the Titans," explains Ezra. "And so it is to you that I bring this message. If you are the creations of the Titans, remember that they are no longer here, and their works and wonders well-hidden, for a reason: that you may grow into your own potential." He pauses, letting this sink in. "A creature called a naaru, an immortal avatar of the Light, accompanies the draenei here from Outland. It bid me deliver this message. And I agree with it. Whatever you learn from the Titans, or their ruins, do not shackle the dwarves to the past."

Brann scratches his head for a long moment. "Well, that's aboot as clear as mud, lad," he says, grinning. "These naaru of yers would make good writers fer fortune cookies. But I like the part about not bein' shackled to the past."

Ezra nods. "The other matter is this. The naga will certainly seek out sites of power, many of which they may know and which we have forgotten. Should you come across such places, the Covenant of the Chalice will need to know. We cannot risk them starting another chalice foundry. Please stay in touch." From his pocket he extracts the seeker-compass, still homing on the _Defiant_, and tosses it over. "If you see this wavering, you'll know we're near."

Brann catches the compass. "Thanks a lot, lad. I'll send messages as I can. Somethin' tells me that the things I'm gonna be learnin' out there'll be things ye'll need ta know, and quick. But I'll find out what we just got ta know, or me name's not Brann Bronzebeard." He gives Ezra a salute. "Take care, lad."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "110 energy, -8 to cast"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All right. Then unless that staff's energy reserves are much higher than I imagined, this'll be a ritual casting with the resources of the Explorer's Guild behind it."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "the cast penalty can be compensated for with extra energy, but that's tough. bringing along another mage, and/or finding a solid ley line to tap, will help on the return trip, but we have more than enough energy to leave IF safely."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "There are familiarity penalties, but I'm going to assume the Explorer's Guild maps mitigate them up to a point. Do you want to pose then roll, or shall we just roll and I'll give you what you see when you arrive?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "let's roll. I'm fine with surprises."

> (OOC) Kaliera cues up the TARDIS sound

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Who put a hole in my TARDIS?"

> (OOC) Sookie.

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 11 (1 4 6) vs. 12, succeeding by 1

The gnomes and dwarves supporting Ezra lower their hands as a shimmering hole opens up in the Explorer's Guild gate chamber. Through the hole is the bright light of the Stranglethorn coast, and the sound of seabirds and surf.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "looks tropic-y, good enough!"

Tidemist steps through first, looking around and tathering his bearings. Finally, he points. "The Altar of Naias is in that direction..." His watery arm lowers slightly, and his voice is grim. "It is not hard to find," he continues. "Just look for the army of naga."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "thanks so much, my friend!"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Oh, btw, there be naga here. kk?"

Kaliera frowns slightly as they pass through; she took the time to prepare some rations for the trip, and they're in a bag slung on her back.

Indeed, the island in the distance is swarming with the children of Dagun, and the beginnings of a temple to the Old God can be seen on the site. Not all is lost, though. Far in the distance can be seen the red and black of pirate sails, with the sharper-eyed spotting Bilgewater heraldry on the masts. Occasionally a small squadron of murlocs attempt to climb up the side, only to be thrown back into the water.

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "How bad is it? PIRATES are a good sign."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "You're also only a few miles up the coast from Grom'gol."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Who here would recognize it? Would you guys have waited around for Saeren and Sookie?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "we would have waited"

And to the south is an encampment with strong wooden walls, and archery towers in the characteristic orcish style. "Grom'gol," says Kagarn. "If they are not already aware of the danger, they will be glad of the warning. If they are aware, they will be glad of assistance."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "YEAH, EVERYONE CAME."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "aRGH CAPSLOCK."

> (OOC) Kaliera is just breathing a little heavily right now. You can... react however YOU want to the teleport o.o

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Any reactions to what you're up against?"

Nerai looks out, "Well, a little warning would have been nice, but it's just more of the same, really."

Kaliera says, "Army. Of Naga. Over there by the pirates. And orcs to the south of us."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "sure. but not too much. I don't want to leave Saeren too far out. :)"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Yeah"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Besides, she loves shootying Nagas."

Ezra snatches up his cane and enters the portal as well. They don't have all day, and he's eager to get back to work. Spinning his cane deftly in his hands, he uses it to gesture at Grom'gol, then at the pirates. "They're our allies. They just don't know it yet. My fellow travelers, let's go show them."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I kind of like that as a closing pose. Anyone have a better one?"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "An Enemy s just a friend you haven't met."
