# Turning Tides 2011-07-17

> (OOC) Log "Tides-2011-07-17" started by TidesGM at Sun Jul 17 17:46:55 2011 CDT (OOC)

Saeren has been kept busy in Ironforge, learning the strengths and weaknesses and capabilities of her new weapon - a dance of war all its own. Sookie has been armoring herself with a leather battle-dress, suitable for combat use. Now that Ezra is back, though, his usual rhythm is imposing itself, and the two learn that the Forsaken mage is already preparing to open a portal to Stranglethorn. They arrive at the chamber of egress just as he completes the ritual and the other members of the group step through.

And as the elemental lord called Tidemist completes his assessment and returns back through the gate, Ezra tips his hat to the recent arrivals. "Onward!" he calls.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Any questions or discussion about where you are right now? Ezra is leading the party toward Grom'gol, per his final pose last time."

Kaliera follows along, using her staff as a walking-stick, and wishing she'd done something to prepare for the weather. She's not used to it being so damp.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anything else? If not, moving us along."

"The road goes ever on," says Saeren, following Ezra with a small grin.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Kaliera, is your sheet up anywhere?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "hold on, let me put it up. I can toss it on Google Docs quickly, I think. Sorry, totally spaced on that."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Google Docs is fine for now. We can get it onto Pandora later."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyway..."

The heat and humidity of Stranglethorn is oppressive, but the scenery is beautiful. The sun glitters on the ocean, and a light breeze takes the edge off the heat, rustling the foliage of the jungle nearby to the beach. And Sookie is the first to notice a patch of foliage, fifteen yards ahead, that does not move with the wind.

The half-elemental does not hesitate, launching a bolt of lightning over the errant weeds that earths itself in a now-smoldering palm tree. And a dozen trolls emerge from the underbrush and charge the party.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "This is not a dice combat. Pose dealing with them as you see fit."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Once they get to melee range, you will notice that they have gills."

Kaliera quietly utters an invocation to the Holy Light, pointing at the one in the lead and sending forth a sense of drowsiness, heaviness of eyes, languor of limbs, wouldn't it be nice to just lie down and ...sleep.

Sookie has been civilized somewhat by the efforts of her teammates. But she has not been softened. Grabbing two of the trolls into midair with the storm-magic she wields, she slams them into two more. As most of them fall, she follows up with a few choice lightning bolts.

Saeren meets her enemies with her weapons drawn, moving to the front. Seeing Sookie has already broken the enemy, she waits for another to draw close. With a twist of her sai she jars loose the crude blade of an enemy, following this up by slamming the enemy's skull with the hilt of its own weapon and leaving it sleeping far less peacefully than its comrade which Kaliera dealt with.

> (OOC) Saeren poses quickly on top of that...

"Gills!" hisses Saeren as she leans down to inspect the foe. "The enemy moves swiftly against us."

Ezra steps forward, whispering a few phrases as three trolls leap at him. He disappears from sight; the trolls' weapons pierce nothing but air. Several yards away, he has reappeared over the fallen bodies of Sookie's victims, peering intently at their markings.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "posing"

Kaliera says, "I'm glad I could keep one alive, then," with a small smile. "We could get useful information.""

Before Ezra's three assailants can regain their bearings, Kagarn plants his totem in the sand at his feet, and stony tendrils rise up, snaring and catching at his attackers' legs. The shaman calls out, "Take them alive if you can!" Nerai heeds his words, and Eecee's steam-powered fists pummel the trolls into submission. As the last is stunned senseless, a bolt of lightning strikes the steam armor, and sparks crawl across it as Nerai grunts in pain.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Loose caster, cc plz."

> (OOC) Kaliera sleeps him too.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Pose doing so, and I think we'll call it good."

Kaliera glances at the last one, apparently some kind of spellcaster, and repeats her spell, channeling a bit more power to get through any spell-defenses he might have. He drops, snoring loudly in two registers.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "The enemy is down, with only a few of them requiring first aid to survive. What do you do with them?"

Saeren nods to Kaliera, "Indeed. A far more reasonable way to manage things. Those I put to rest don't wake so easily.. and their minds are sometimes forgetul."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Ezra will interrogate some. He speaks Troll and has a decent (17) Intimidation in undead form."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "let's grail some to get em back first though"

> (OOC) TidesGM will pose briefly.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Yes. Getting some clarity on my weapon from GM ^^ afk one sec..."

Kaliera says, "The Light urges compassion, but there are times when compassion cannot defend you properly, and lethal force must be used. I do not shy from such things, nor do I condemn those whose skills like in that direction; they are using their skills for their best purpose, eh?"

The would-be ambushers are quickly restrained, and the few who were seriously wounded are quickly patched up by Kaliera and Kagarn. All of them are unconscious, but some slight healing magic - plus a splash of ocean water - is enough to revive one of the warriors for interrogation.

> (OOC) TidesGM swaps

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Want to pose the grail, or shall I cover that as well?"

> (OOC) TidesGM will cover it, to keep things moving.

The still-groggy troll struggles in his bonds, but cannot resist the draught from the grail being poured down his throat. He screams and thrashes as the magic takes hold and the gills fade away. As his eyes clear, though, he spits on the ground. "Pah! You think you freed me? You tink we be _slave_ to de naga? You have no understanding! De Old God give us _powah_! Powah to rule dis land, as we did long ago!"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So is Ezra bad cop and I'm good cop, or?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "You choose. :>"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "But since Ezra's doing the intimidation, probably."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I think we'll both be bad cop, as usual, probably. :)"

> (OOC) Sookie has this.

Ezra leans in. His command of the various troll dialects is quite adequate. "We didn't free you," he replies, calmly at first. "What tribe are you?"

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 9 (3 4 2) vs. 12, succeeding by 3

The troll sneers, an expression that comes easily to one so well endowed with tusks. "We be de Bloodscalp," he says.

"Oh, very good then. So those would be your ruins nearby. The small useless ones," remarks Ezra. "Not the Gurubashi. Not the Amani. Not the trolls who _matter_. Who _still died._" The wizard rises. "The naga care nothing for your ways. Dagun cares even less. You trolls fight and die, forgotten in this jungle. You're worse than slaves. You think there's power to be taken from your enemies? _You have no power._ Even slaves have the hope of freedom. You're just trash. You're expendable ammunition for the naga."

The troll leans back, glaring at Ezra. "We shall see who be expendable," he growls. "De naga will reunite de Bloodscalp, an den we'll see whedder de Gurubashi are so strong. An' den, we will see who Dagun favors. De naga cannot take dis land wit'out us."

"They don't need you," Ezra answers calmly, stepping back and pointing across the bay. Out to the distant ships. "They have the goblins. You were just _in their way_. The goblins have ships, cannon, vehicles. You have... shrunken heads."

The troll laughs. "Vehicles? _Machines_? I can't wait to see machines try to get t'rough de jungle. Dat be a good joke!"

"You haven't seen their shredders." Ezra points now behind him, at Eecee. "Machines like that. Sawblades instead of hands. The Venture Company decimated Stonetalon's forests with such machines, in the face of stronger opposition than _your_ pitiful little tribe could muster. Your jungle won't last a year."

The wizard leans in again. "So really, let's be honest, you pathetic tusked piece of garbage. What do _you_ possibly have to offer the naga, except your flesh as a sacrifice on our arrows?"

The troll glares at Eecee, then snarls wordlessly at Ezra.

> (OOC) Saeren poses quickly.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "we have this new routine called Bad Cop and Worse Cop"

Saeren's weapon shifts form with her thought, drawing into the form of a watery bow with arrow drawn and string taut, aimed at the troll. "Ezra! Enough of this. We have work to do and my patience grows thin. Let me 'cure' this one limb by limb and we can be on our way. He's no better than a Naga anyway."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "One more fast one.."

Saeren adds with a sneer, "Besides, the stench of this gill-bearer is making Shade sick." At her side, appearing suddenly like an apparition, the great nightsaber growls deep.

Kaliera doesn't start. Much.

The troll's fangs snap at Saeren. "No better than a naga!" he shrieks. "You elves t'ink you so hot!"

"The naga were once the Highborne, you know," Ezra remarks offhandedly. "Elves. You're working for transformed elves. You're _idolizing_ elves. Taking pleasure in being offered a scrap of power by elves. The name Bloodscalp - hah. The prize cowards of all trolls."

Saeren's face grows calm after the angry outburst of the troll. She does not release the tension on her bow. "You have to but give the word, Ezra," she says placidly.

"Dagun don't care _who_ serve him," the troll growls. "De naga, dey just His messengers. You t'ink we forgot what dey are - _dey_ t'ink we forgot what dey are. When de trolls are one... den dey find out what we forgot an' what we didn' forgot."

Ezra just laughs at that. "That you remember is _even worse_," he points out. "Where is your pride? Where is your strength? You've enslaved _yourselves_. No grail in the world will cure you of this foolishness." He rises. "If I were to have you placed in the ocean, you would drown. Unless we pulled you out, or unless you drank the chalice again. To be a slave, one way or another. There is only one way out for you. The Bloodscalp must find their own strength, and not rely on others for their power. But I don't think you can do it. Can you prove me wrong?"

In response, the troll roars with rage, and his whipcord muscles bulge as he strains at his bonds, slavering at the mouth. A few of the hempen strands give way as he struggles.

"Useless," remarks Ezra. "As I expected. Is this the strength of the naga's foot soldiers?"

"You talk powah! I show you powah!" the troll howls, still thrashing. The rope gives way completely - and the troll gets about half a step toward Ezra before his limbs are pinioned by crackling gusts of wind. The troll still struggles, but he might as well be encased in stone.

"Fool," Ezra spits in his face. "This is our power! Look around you." He gestures at Saeren, then at Sookie, then Kaliera, then Eecee and Kagarn. "People working together. Their strengths combined. Fighting for a common cause, willingly. We don't enslave each other. We have cooperated. And that is how you were defeated. But you have something else, a strength I will acknowledge. When you drank from the grail, you threw off Dagun's hold over you. Your will was greater than an Old God's. Do you think you still have that strength in your heart?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "They're speaking Troll, yes?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "we can throw Borrow Language and/or Tongues around. but I'll speak whatever the troll can understand"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "I have Borrow Language; I was going to try to use it to listen in and then possibly use some skills."

The troll is still in the grip of a berserker rage, and for several seconds gives Ezra no more answer than snarling and gnashing of tusks. When it dissipates, the troll slumps boneless, hovering in the air before Ezra. "You no troll. You no understand."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "The troll seems to at least know common, since it understood Saeren. :)"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "True!"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I haven't a clue about troll language, so I assume I can only understand what it yelled at me :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone who cares, roll Theology (Troll) or IQ-6."

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 12 (4 5 3) vs. 8, failing by 4

> (OOC) Kaliera rolls v for 0 (0)

> (OOC) Kaliera rolls 8 for 8 (8)

> (OOC) Kaliera rolls 3d6 for 13 (3 4 6) vs. 8, failing by 5

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "yay going in with no clue! :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Failing will do you no great harm."

"You have one chance," Ezra answers. "The naga didn't give you one. I do. Be our ally. We will lend you our strength, and you will lend us yours. Or, die as a slave of the naga." His voice gains something, some intensity. "Listen. The fire in your heart - the naga cannot take that. Dagun cannot take that. We aren't trolls. We don't understand. But you can _make us_ understand. If you help us. Choose, now."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "oh? GM, feel free to retcon this then"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Please do, Kaliera. :)"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "...well, if the 'tides take you all thing' stands, I wouldn't take the action, so"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Well, feel free to intervene before that if you like."

Kaliera steps forward as Ezra finishes, feeling something move within her. "No, we do not understand what you have done, or why you have done it, but I understand one thing: what it feels like to be chased, downtrodden. My people have been chased by darkness for many, many years, by our brothers and sisters who betrayed us. We have found strength in others, allies, even friends, and stood against those enemies. Stand with us. Teach us your reasons, your ways, and make us stronger, and yourselves stronger. Together, we can start to build something better." She reaches out her hand to the troll. "I am Kaliera. What is your name?"

The troll squints at the priestess. "Kaliera, your name, eh? What _are_ you?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "The usual trollish xenophobia is still in play, but it has to take a moment to figure out a /new/ kind of alien, at least."

Kaliera says, "A draenei. A priestess. Many members of my race chose to become demons of the Burning Crusade; those that did not - like my family - were chased by them for that, and many died. And yet we would not have chosen otherwise. I know little of your people, but everyone I have met has had something to teach me that I did not know. This is the way of the Light, for me: to see things. You are proud, and you care for your people. Those are things I can respect deeply."

For the first time, there is a hint of curiosity in the troll's expression, though the sneer is not entirely gone. "You were offered power, an' turned it _away_? Why weren't you crushed by de powerful?"

Kaliera says, "Because with the power came not alliance, but slavery. Bowing to the wills of the leader of the Crusade, doing what they wished. We would have gained power and been unable to do anything but their will. And... we were unwilling to perform the sorts of acts they would have wanted us to do. Murder of entire races, entire worlds. No. We chose to remain ourselves; weaker, perhaps, but still ourselves. To stand or fall by our own power, not to stand as puppets. To be the Draenei and choose our path, not to be the Eredar manari and walk as eternal slaves, bound at the soul."

Kaliera says, "Why were we not crushed? We were flexible, we could choose... and we knew how to hide and run until we were ready to strike."

The troll starts to sneer again - few trolls outside the Darkspear would shy away from 'murder' of other races, after all. But he begins to listen more closely as Kaliera continues. "Strike from de shadows... now _dat_ be better troll t'inkin'."

The troll looks away, to the jungle from where he'd come. "So what you want of me, eh? I can't go back to me tribe like dis. Dey'd string me up fer sure. Or else drink me from de chalice again."

"Or you - and these fellows with you - could ambush _them_. Use the grail to cure them. You could lead your tribe, if you had the strength you showed me," says Ezra quietly. "You can help us, in our ambush of the naga."

The troll begins to smirk - but this time, it is not directed at the adventurers. "Hmm. And I be de new chieftain, den?"

"Your choice. The fire within you - will it burn stronger than that of your opponents?" The wizard shrugs. "Power comes from choice. The willingness to do a thing. The wisdom to not do a thing until the time is right. What choice will you make now?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "By now those of you with more of a general theological bent - Ezra, Kaliera, and kagarn, in particular - are starting to get the troll's drift. The tradition of trolls is to make alliances with powerful beings or forces. Allying with Dagun is, in this way, no different than allying with Hakkar."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "yeah"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "The Light is too foreign to the troll way of thinking, but the Sacred Fire has a chance."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "it's the Light with the serial numbers filed off. <\_<K"

"You talk a lot, zombie," says the troll. "But y'know, I'm kinda curious now. Heh heh. Be fun to surprise de naga for a change. Even if it mean workin' wit wussy 'draenei'."

"I talked a lot. And you listened," replies Ezra with a shrug. "It's good if it works. Now maybe you can explain what you think about this to your comrades."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "we can grail the lot of them at this point, I think."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sounds good."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Sure."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Want me to cover it, or would someone else like to?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "go ahead"

The rest of the ambush party is awakened and purged of the naga's taint, and the first troll - who calls himself Zen'jal - is soon in a spirited argument with his brethren. It is rough going at first, but eventually it is the thought of breaking with the aquatic Highborne that wins the day, and - with a little encouragement from Ezra - the trolls agree to work together in a coup against their current chieftain, plotting to be the 'fire' that consumes their enemies.

Zen'jal turns to the adventurers, grinning toothily. "Don' think you be safe from us, now. You just not at de top of our list anymore. We got our naga worshippin' witch doctor to deal wit first, an den de naga. Den... we see."

"We will both work to become stronger," agrees Ezra. "But you will have your hands full with the naga for a long time. Good luck."

The troll laughs. "Stay away from de voodoo," he says, and he and his companions vanish into the undergrowth.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anything more amongst yourselves, or shall we continue to Grom'gol?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I suddenly realized how to get through to the trolls."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "but let's continue"

Kaliera says, "That was... interesting. I must learn their language and find something about their culture."

---

Grom'gol Base Camp is a heavily fortified encampment, with thick wooden palisades forming the primary defensive barriers. Orcish archery platforms dot the perimeter, and a much taller structure in the center of the camp is clearly designed as a zeppelin tower.

Kagarn nods to Sookie. "We will take our leave of you here," he says to the others. "I will expect your call in one hour, Ezra. We will discuss our respective efforts then, and consider how to coordinate the goblins and the orcs."

Sookie's eyes glow with the storm, and taking Kagarn in her grasp, the two recede into the distance, en route to the goblin besiegers of the Haunted Isle, while the rest of the party proceeds to Grom'gol.

The diverse adventurers are met with initial skepticism by Grom'gol's scouts, but Ezra is quickly recognized, and Commander Aggro'gosh is more than happy to receive the Covenant of the Grail. "Welcome to Grom'gol. I trust you are here about the naga who have taken over the Haunted Isle?" he says.

Ezra provides introductions, including the two absent members. "We are here to drive them from the island and claim it for the Covenant, yess," he explains. "There iss a great ssecret there which will help uss in the battle againsst Dagun."

"Well, we will provide what help we can," says Aggro'gosh. "We can hold out against the naga here, but we do not have the forces to strike at them directly. It seems that the goblins are similarly at a stalemate."

"Our alliess are on the way to correct that sstate of affairss," offers Ezra reassuringly. "I have a plan which will disstract the naga, allowing the goblinss ssome time to regain their sstrength, and for uss to sstrike a final blow."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "at this point Ezra gets out a laptop and shows Aggro'gosh the strat page on pandoraslair.org"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Behold the true power of the Titan i900 quad core processor!"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Combined with gnomish technology - only explodes 1% of the time!"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "99% of the time it doesn't kill you! What more could you ask for?"

Aggro'gosh and Ezra discuss the plan at great length. "Devious," says the orcish commander, grinning. "Play upon the enemy's fears and lead them into a trap. I would expect no less from the Forsaken. But you will need help to plant the necessary seeds of doubt."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "more"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Inserting my own mini pose that can go in anywhere here.."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Go ahead."

"Thuss our presence here," replies Ezra.

As Ezra and Aggro'gash speak of their plans, Saeren directs her attention to Kaliera for a moment to whisper, "That was impressive with the trolls. I felt certain we were going to lose them. You tipped the balance, and I'm grateful for it."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Kaliera and Saeren are free to converse amongst themselves - gives me more time to write Aggro'gosh's poses."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "What Ezra said was correct and K proved it. we combine our strengths to achieve victory :D"

Kaliera smiles, and says quietly, "I serve the Light, and felt a moment of illumination would be helpful. I am glad I was a help." Then she tilts her head. "I should probably see if I can put together a bit of a snack."

> (OOC) Sookie brb. continue plottin :)

"Nimboya will assist you," Aggro'gosh says to Ezra. "He was raised in Stranglethorn, and knows the local tribes well. Hy will instruct you on how to craft your illusion, and teach you a few phrases of trollish battle-language. And as you make your retreat, he will help to conceal your escape from the naga scryers."

The troll Nimboya bows deeply. "I have no doubt that de great Ezra has his voodoo to hide from de prying eyes," he says. "But I fear de naga witches may be able to tell your ways from ours. For your plan to work, dey have to t'ink we be using what de trolls use."

Saeren laughs at the mention of a snack and confides to Kaliera, "Food is something we old campaigners never turn down. But truly, it was a great thing to see them open their minds to a new possibility. It's a talent I would learn if I could. Brute force rarely wins others to a cause."

> (OOC) Sookie re. so yeah,I don't have too much else to add here. whatever the Grom'guys think is best, we'll do that

Aggro'gosh continues. "As for the ambush itself, Kragg is one of my best commanders. He will lead the orcish forces. I encourage you to respect his judgment in the ordering of battle."

Kragg looks over the party. "I've heard so much about you. Glad you could join us." He looks at Kaliera with barely concealed distaste. "But I had not heard that you were traveling with a draenei," he adds, spitting on the ground.

"Life is full of surprises," answers Ezra blandly.

Kaliera opens her bag and begins to pull out things - a bit more than you'd think it could fit, really - unwrapping cheeses, sausages, and some bread, followed by two small jars, one of butter and one of a pungent, green jam. "I have a gift for speech, I am told - I have trained it, as well. We have our skills, and we use them as best we can." She glances at Kragg, and smiles mildly... then goes back to arranging the food, very deliberately ignoring the insult.

The orc snorts at Ezra. "Well, you know your own business best," he says. "Just make sure she doesn't run away in the middle of battle."

Kaliera is glad she's facing away from Kragg. Saeren may see her smile stiffen as she grits her teeth.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "This won't do."

"Do you serve the warchief of the Horde?" Ezra asks quietly.

"What? Of course I do," says Kragg. "What are you talking about?"

Saeren's ears miss nothing, and she turns her eyes on the orc, narrowing them considerably. She speaks in Draenic to Kaliera, "Take little note of him. Ever our company is greeted with such a lack of confidence. Yet always we save those who doubt us."

"Thrall stood in the Exodar. The crashed remnants of the ship the draenei used to flee their world." The wizard's voice is still calm and composed. "He stood without fear before thousands of their soldiers and mages. He could have been struck down at any time, by any vengeful draenei who felt the need to attack an orc for what the orcs had done to their people. And he spoke words of peace and alliance to them. Because we have something bigger to face. He knew it. The draenei knew it." And only now does Ezra's voice raise. "They fight Dagun. With us. With the Horde. By the warchief's command. And you and I are the warchief's instrument. This is the war in which we risk our lives for honor and glory. With them. And we do _not have time for such unbecoming remarks_. No accusation of cowardice against a comrade in arms will stand in my presence. _Do you understand?_"

Kaliera replies in the same tongue, "I expect it from some orcs. I try to be tolerant but still I struggle. So goes life."

Kragg holds Ezra's gaze for only a few moments. He glances briefly at Kaliera once more, then stares straight ahead. "It shall be as you say, Ezra Pyreborn," he says. "For the Horde!"

Ezra nods. "Grom'gol is strong!" he shouts. "The naga number in the hundreds. The murlocs in the thousands. But I knew that to come to you meant success. Now let us defeat them. Lok'tar Ogar!"

> (OOC) Sookie wrote a treatise on orc relations. all seven popes ordered it burned.

Every orc in Aggro'gosh's command hut joins in the cry. "Lok'tar Ogar!"

> (OOC) Sookie thinks we've got this place under control. ^\_^

"Well, it seems things are settled now," says Saeren. "I wish it were such a simple matter among my own people." She smiles at Kaliera, "I am afraid you will find that tour tolerance far exceeds that of my own. I have little patience for these matters. Luckily, we have Ezra with us to manage the horde."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "And Ezra with us to manage the alliance as well, generally speaking.."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone else have anything for now?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "negatory"

---

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. There are two things we can do next, in no particular order."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "a) Bill can upload the events with the goblins. b) We can do the false-flag operation."

> (OOC) Sookie should paste the former in, so we get all the 'plan is explained' stuff together

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Makes sense to me. In the immortal words of Leslie Nielsen, let 'er rip."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "also so I can get my luchadore references in"

Sookie carries Kagarn away from the beaches of Stranglethorn and across the Veiled Sea. The tauren clutches a grail protectively - some of the goblins might already be infected. The pair target the flagship of the Bilgewater Cartel's fleet, which is even now beset by murlocs and a handful of naga. The goblin crew are using some sort of flexible pipe apparatus, and spraying high-pressure streams of water at the murlocs. These water cannon prove efficient at washing murlocs entirely off the ship.

As they approach, shouts ring out - they've been spotted. All eyes are on the cup in Kagarn's hand as Sookie lands them on deck. The cry goes up: "They got Grom'gol!" Kagarn holds up a hand, ready to begin a long explanation of his purpose. He's cut short as a mountain of a hobgoblin wearing a silvery mask wades out from the murloc-filled melee. By the ship's wheel, a small goblin wearing a hat so fancy it verges on the baroque - presumably the captain of the ship - shouts out. "Restrain 'em, Santoaf!" As ordered, the hobgoblin grabs hold of Kagarn without effort, lifting him overhead in a complicated arm lock.

Sookie, of course, is having none of it. The storm swirls around her, snatching up both hobgoblin and shaman at once, and smashing the creature mask-first into the deck. Kagarn falls free; Sookie expected that. But a move that has been enough to kill naga myrmidons only stunned this immense being. He's already starting to rise, shaking his head a little to wear off the shock.

"We come in peace!" bellows Kagarn, keeping it short. "We're friends! This is a grail - for purifying the Tide-touched. We've no wish to fight." Hearing this, the elaborately hatted goblin holds up his hands. "Stand down, crew! Santa Mammona, we were worried for a moment." As the hobgoblin starts to charge again, the captain bellows again. "Santoaf! Friends! They're friends! Get back to the murlocs."

Relieved, Kagarn steps forward. "My name is--" He's cut short by the captain. "Kagarn, yeah, I know, we've heard of you. You're with Nerai, yeah?" Kagarn nods. "Then you know we're also here to help you against the naga."

The captain looks across the deck; the murlocs are still being swept away by the high-power hoses, and by the physical prowess of Santoaf. "We got that in hand for now, but we're gonna run out of supplies pretty quick. I'm Captain Boltloose, the Blue Demon of Bilgewater. Nice to meetcha."

"Our companions have a plan," begins Kagarn, and explains briefly. Boltloose listens attentively at times, at other times bellowing orders to his crew as though ignoring the tauren. But then he gets right back to listening, and it seems by the end that he's grasped the idea. "Fine, fine. I'll help you guys out, on one condition."

"What would that be?" asks Kagarn, a little bemused. "What price should allies against the naga ask of each other?"

"After this is over, you lend me that little girl you got there, for the Inter-Cartel Oafageddon Wrestling matches. Anyone who's a match for Santoaf has gotta have a shot at the title! And oh yeah, I'll cut you in for half the purse. But between us, the real money's on the betting, and she's gonna come in at 50 to 1 easy!"

Kagarn narrows his eyes. Then a thought hits him. "This.... Oafageddon. This is a contest of physical prowess, and is non-lethal?" he asks.

Boltloose nods, activating a device that hurls a very surprised-looking octopus into the faces of a pack of murloc. Behind him, Santoaf has grabbed two myrmidons and is applying pressure; both are rapidly slapping the decks with a free hand, begging for mercy as they try to escape the submission hold. Things seem to be under control.

"This would be good for Sookie, I think. Very well, we accept," concludes Kagarn. Boltloose spits on his hand and extends it; reluctantly, the tauren takes it. The goblin grins. "Good! You got yourselves a fleet. Now whatcha need from us?"

"For now, keep the naga busy," replies Kagarn, rubbing his horn. "In that regard, these water cannons seem highly effective. How do they work?"

Boltloose cackles. "Holes in the hull fill chambers with seawater. We use phlogiston to compress it and spray it out." This earns a look of shock from Kagarn: "You are sinking your own ship to do this?"

"Sure," the goblin shrugs. "It's the Bilgewater way. If a competitor is trying to do something, beat him to it!"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "everyone should have a shot at contributing"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "True!"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "The essence of the attack is to make the naga think that a tribe of far-off trolls are attacking them and have bows capable of turning them into lamia. it helps that we now have an /actual jungle troll tribe/ working against them."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "so whatever you guys have that'll contribute to that is welcome"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "So who wants to go first?"

> (OOC) Sookie will set it up

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I have a feeling my roll is clear.. use the war wave. :)"

The haunted isle is guarded day and night. With enough forces and to spare, sentries - murlocs, backed up by naga overseers - make sure that any approaching force or stealthy individual is spotted and reported. Of course, this is what Ezra is counting on.

And so a pair of troll-built canoes creep across the water, silenced by authentic troll magic, and manned - for the most part - by authentic trolls. Grom'gol has a few members of the Darkspear among them, along with Saeren and other members of the party along for the ride. Through illusions carefully planned in advance and just as carefully woven, the raiding party is made to look like jungle trolls.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "okay. Saeren, set up your shot. Kaliera, throw in anything here that you think will help"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "your goal is to shoot sentries until we get some lamia, then bag 'em and make a run for it"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "so no double-eye-shots. ^\_^"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Very well, very well.."

Saeren's eyes track the shore carefully, waiting for the opportunity she needs. Some patrols are simply worthless, consistently solely of murlocs. Little use there. It isn't long, however, before she's found the real quarry. For those in the boat not used to her rate of fire, it's not doubt an educational experience as her new weapon allows her to fire in such rapidity that the eye can barely track the motions of her hand. A party of three naga are all struck in rapid succession. The first volley strikes two with glancing blows, the next finds the third.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "We want three things, I reckon.. one, a success. Two, a failure to report it. Finally, Saeren is going to demand that any new Lamia are saved."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "of course. they're going to be our double agents"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "we're takin them with us."

> (OOC) Sookie guesses GM gets to tell us what happens here :D

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I will take it another pose. :)"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "If that's okay?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Go ahead. The first volley produced no lamia."

Seeing no Lamia, Saeren lets loose more arrows. These scouts shall report nothing this night. Onward the canoe glides, silent on the waters. The next war party of note consists of two naga and three murlocs. Saeren's opponents include a witch this time, and that is where she aims first. The war wave slashes the enemy with more arrows, occasionally diverting a sound blast to a murloc. The elf is taking care that at least one murloc should survive, if a bit worse for wear.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Any luck this time?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "This time, both naga turn."

Saeren can feel, as much as see that the work has succeeded. She is off the canoe like a dart, racing to the side of the newly turned. And not a second too soon. Her work has drawn attention, and from further inland there are adversaries attacking. Saeren is drawn up short and begins to fire volley after volley into the darkness, her eyes somehow discerning a target. "To the boat!" she cries at the Lamia. She guards their steps, finally reaching the canoe where one of the weapons of the enemy catches her. The trident is largely turned by her armor, but a wound remains to remind her of this night.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "gotta afk to eat for a while now.... hope that is a good finish off for me.."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Who's next?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Kaliera if anything. otherwise I can move us alon"

> (OOC) Sookie checks K.

> (OOC) Sookie guess not. moving along!

> (OOC) Kaliera has disconnected.

> (OOC) Kaliera has connected.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "catch up when you can. if you have anything to contribute to the proceedings, now's a good time for it"

Kaliera , back in the canoe, waits for Saeren to return; when she does, she mutters a spell, healing the wound up before it can become a problem.

> (OOC) Sookie movin on then.

Between Ezra's control over gate magic and Sookie's ability to exert force, the canoes are on the other end of the island much quicker than they could be naturally. None of this should be seen from the shore; the trolls of Grom'gol, and the midnight mist they conjure, see to that. And so the party repeats the process, after changing their appearances slightly. Old bows are thrown overboard, to avoid their arrows being traced magically; new weapons are unrolled and readied. Only the war-wave stays the same.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "okay, we do it again, GM!"

On the next assault, Saeren scores solid hits on two of the three naga in the patrol. One of them transforms into a lamia, and the other two move to grab him - only to fall quickly with watery arrows through their eyes. The survivor spots Saeren's frantic gesturing and makes for the waterline, throwing gurgling murlocs aside like toys.

Mission accomplished. There are survivors, who can only what they have seen: that two separate groups of trolls assaulted the island on opposite sides, converting naga into lamia and taking them away. The canoes melt into the mist of night, taking their precious cargo with them.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I haz nothing else"

> (OOC) TidesGM will wrap for today.

Hours later, lurking on the shoreline as she debriefs her latest lamia friends, Saeren spots unusually frenetic activity around the central temple stronghold on the Haunted Isle. Patrols are pulled further inland, and several of the patrollers are organizing on the temple grounds, with women moving among them. The naga are on the move.
