# Turning Tides 2011-08-24

The war-party had no difficulty making its way back to Grom'gol in short order; after all, the party that opened one portal is still on hand to open another. A skeleton crew will pilot the zeppelin back. Resources are needed on the shore now, and urgently.

Sookie has been caught again with her hand in Kaliera's bag of food. Her hunting instincts, perfected against the wildlife of Hillsbrad and Dalaran's outriding mage-apprentices, are quite enough to pilfer a wedge of cheese before she's caught. With one hand insouciantly still in the bag, she asks in a calm voice: "Na, na, you demon. Goshi traitor to Horde. Why nobody admit what they are?"

Kaliera raises an eyebrow. "I am not a demon. The demons - the Eredar Manari - were part of our race, but they betrayed us all. If anything, they are denying what they were." She slices some ham, putting it on a plate; some sliced turkey meat goes with it. Some of it may be closer to Sookie than others.

The girl thinks about this a moment. Then realization clicks. "Yah. Dumb dwarf call me human one time. He wrong, but I look like, so easy mistake. Same thing?"

Kaliera says, "Mostly. They sold their hearts for power, willingly, and became creatures of hate." Some bread is sliced, put with the rest, along with small crocks of butter, honey, and apple-butter. "They chose to become what they are. We chose to remain what we are." She shakes her head sadly. "We mourn them.""

One of the orcs from the camp, a bruiser by the name of Gorlash, muscles his way - figuratively and literally - into the conversation, snatching up a slice of bread and cramming it into his mouth. "The draenei is right, little human," he growls. "Kragg is wrong. It's not the draenei who were cowards. _They_ never put us in _camps_." He practically spits the last word.

Kaliera frowns, very slightly. "Kragg and I have spoken. He had his reasons for his beliefs, and to his honor, he has looked into his heart and found what pricks him. I understand why he felt how he did, and I am glad that he finds reasons to reconsider. As to the other..." She pauses, thinking. "It is before my people arrived on Azeroth. I have heard tales of it, and it seems a sad and terrible thing, but some humans did try to make some changes. And some of those humans died for it." The name is not spoken, but Gorlash probably knows the story of Taretha....

"Not enough died," continues Gorlash, following this pronouncement with a chug from a ceramic crock of wine. "Death is the price all cowards pay. Isn't that right, little human?" He stares down at Sookie with undisguised contempt.

Kaliera says, "I think I might advise you to be careful with your tone. Sookie has been known to be... quite dangerous in battle." She smiles gently. "I do not think she would kill you for your insults. I may be wrong.""

The girl herself hasn't said a word, but finally stands. Defiantly she takes a bite of honey-spiced bread. Without warning Gorlash is lifted into the air, finding himself surrounded by the crackling energy of the storm. "Human. Coward. Death." She intones each word as though considering it, while the helpless orc is left floundering. And after a moment she sets him down again. "Talk is useless," she concludes. Enraged, Gorlash charges - and Sookie unleashes her attack.

The angry orc finds his mouth stuffed with bread and cheese. "Eat," Sookie remarks, forcing him to sit down. "Is good food." And she takes a seat as well, holding Gorlash in place.

Kaliera watches quietly, remembering a comment from Ezra as he was describing the group to her: 'One does not so much command Sookie as... well, unleash her and stand out of the radius.'

Sookie glances over at Kaliera, and grins suddenly. "Obey goshi. Goshi say no hurt people. Goshi say protect. I protect orc from me."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "So," Kaliera says. "Would you like some mustard? I have some Darnassian kimchi which is truly impressive in its spice, as well.""

> (OOC) Sookie says, "go for it:D"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "ack, sorry"

Kaliera says, "So, would you like some mustard? I have some Darnassian kimchi which is truly impressive in its spice, as well."

Gorlash finds this business of humiliation more difficult to swallow than the food that was mystically shoveled into his mouth. "No," he demurs with as much grace as he can muster, given his current state. "I am.. fine." But he does still glare at Sookie.

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Was the Dark Portal re-opened, or is it still closed? I can't remember."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "it's not a major part of the story. blood elf pilgrims have just started leaving for Outland, but this isn't common knowledge."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "so as far as anyone here will know, it's still closed"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "ok, thanks."

Kaliera says, "Sookie is not human; she is unique." She rummages in the bag, coming out with some cups. "Who is truly as they seem, after all? I am Draenei; I remember days of peace, with orcs trading with our villages, and us trading with them." She glances at Gorlash. "And nights of terror, running from those same orcs. I think I prefer the days of the present, where I know that I can trust the honor of the orcs.""

Gorlash grunts. But before he can offer much more offense, Ezra swings by as well. He is undead again, wrapped in scented white bandages as before, his black broad-brimmed hat pulled down to cover his face. "Ahh, Kaliera. Good. Thiss is a matter which deservess your attention, yess. Please join me."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "we move to the second half! this will be shorter."

Kaliera bows to Sookie and Gorlash. "I am needed. Please, feel free to have some more to eat." She takes her staff, and follows Ezra.

The Forsaken leads the way to Nimboya and his cauldron. "We come to a weighty matter," Ezra explains. "There iss much potential in the Aggramar Catalysst. But to fully undersstand itss power, we musst study itss effects..." He gestures; a collection of the lamia step forward, bowing, saluting or otherwise acknowledging the summons. "These people were recently transsformed by itss power. As a priest, as an alchemisst, as a worshipper of the Light, I believe that you are ideally suited to this.." But then he pauses, glancing questioningly at Nimboya.

Kaliera waits, as something is apparently going on.

"You ssaid you had a laboratory," remarks Ezra dubiously. The troll grins, showing an excess of yellow-black teeth. "Right here, mon." With his stick, Nimboya taps the cauldron that's bubbling away. "An _alchemical_ laboratory," stresses Ezra, and again the troll taps the black iron. "Ya, mon, look closely now." Ezra takes another look, and actually steps back. "Sso you do." He wheels, excitedly gesturing to Kaliera. "Do you ssee what he did? Thermally sseparated layerss of chemically neutral agentss in the cauldron. The ladle iss hollow and reinforced - he can introduce liquids to any layer he likess. The heat of the fire iss perfectly controlled, through magic--" "Loa," interrupts Nimboya. "--Loa, yess yess. Anyway, thiss should be ssufficient, don't you agree?"

Kaliera looks at it, then the slight glow of her eyes slips to purple, then back again. "Indeed. I have read on some of the Troll techniques of... the Loa... and I do see it. It's very impressive - easily the match of some of the facilities of the Exodar." She nods. "I think it should be more than sufficient."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Visual effect of her mage-sight."

Ezra rubs his hands together. "Very well. Then thiss will sserve as a greater introduction to the lamia, as well as - perhapss - a disscovery of the truth of the Catalysst, yes. We Forssaken worked for a time on the naga's own grailss. Now we musst masster this new challenge."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "so at this point, if you feel like throwing down a pose or two, go nuts. Mike's already talked to me about some refinements we can make - products of alchemy that can enhance the 'grail' effect, like a delayed reaction to it."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "if you have no particular inspiration now, we can wrap instead :) "

Kaliera refers to notes she'd gotten from the alchemist's in the North, along with some things of her own based on it, and enters excited discussions with Nimboya. Despite their rather differing accents and grammer, the universal language of alchemy bridges much of it. The two of them end needing to be dragged back to where they sleep, because they were falling asleep while working on ideas - a delayed reaction of the Grail effect, for example, seems quite possible.

The one thing that offered problems - the differing religious and magical systems they use - almost falls to the wayside as their quest for knowledge and understanding binds them.

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "I am assuming that Nimboya is a shaman. :)"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I thiiiink witch doctor, which is the next best thing. He's got all the trappings of one if you hang out with him in-game."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "but they're functionally interchangeable so yeah"

> (OOC) Kaliera nods.

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Ok, I think I'm done here, if you have nothig else then?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "nope, that looks good :) hope that was fun and divertin'"

Gorlash regards Sookie warily, as the pair watch Ezra and Kaliera retreat.

"Where did a human learn to do that at such a young age?" the orc demands sullenly. "I thought what passes for elementalists needed years to learn their art."

"Not mage," Sookie answers, idly dissecting an apple with a war-knife. "Half-elemental. Twilight Hammer make me, for attacking Stormwind."

"The Hammer?" The orc sounds incensed now - well beyond any casual racism he might have previously exhibited. "Those demon-loving, rot-stinking, verminous scum? You're even worse then, girl - those damned orcs cost us the First War. How dare you?"

Sookie shrugs this off. "That old clan. New clan take all. Orc, human, dwarf. No care about Alliance or Horde. They bring back Old Gods, worship elementals, bring end of world."

Gorlash quiets down. "Then.... after that fight... they really did become completely insane." He pounds his green fist on the table in anger, then pauses as awareness strikes. "Wait. Why are you traveling with this lot then? Especially a shu'halo shaman. They're mortal enemies. Don't you know _anything_, girl?"

"Not with clan. Run away many year ago. Keeper named Hurragh, order me to leave clan, bind to shaman of Earthen Ring." Sookie switches from Common - which Gorlash had been speaking out of a twisted sort of courtesy - to fluent Orcish. "I know about clan. Raised in clan. Made to be weapon. I was... I was monster. Like drinking demon blood. Saeren and Nerai show me .. that clan ways wrong. Now I fight against end of world. I protect precious friends."

Gorlash doesn't say anything for a few minutes. But finally he grunts. It's the orcish grunt that Sookie knows substitutes for a deeper meaning: _I was wrong, but I can't say it_. "If you fight against the Twilight's Hammer, I guess you can't be a coward." He shovels a slice of pie into his mouth, left over from Kaliera's stash, swallows it, and grins widely. "Lok'tar ogar, girl."
