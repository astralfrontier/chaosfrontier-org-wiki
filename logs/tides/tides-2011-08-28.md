# Turning Tides 2011-08-28

> (OOC) Log "Tides-2011-08-28" started by Sookie at Sun Aug 28 16:59:25 2011 CDT (OOC)

Several lamia were produced as part of Grom'gol's ambush of the naga expeditionary force - those naga sent into the jungle to discover the secret of the "troll" water-weapon. Among them was the force commander, who provided much useful information. And among this information was the naga fallback plan - that once the position on the island became untenable, the naga there would gate themselves directly to the Bloodscalp capital.

In response, Ezra is advocating for a pre-emptive strike against the Bloodscalp leadership. His theory is that the naga won't leave the island if they believe they have nowhere to go. And his preparations send three people Nerai's way.

The first is Ezra himself, who wants to know about the feasibility of mounting cannon on the zeppelins docked here at Grom'gol.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "feel free to throw in a note here, dialogue or whatever additional plans you like - this is the 'modern military tactics' business you've talked about. What's the best way to bomb an island without getting shot down in return?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "if you have no great ideas now, that's fine too, we have time before we attack :)"

Nerai hmms at Ezra, "Well, you could probably put cannons on the Zeplins, but they wouldn't work the same as ships at sea. They would be innaccurate at best, as they would get blown across the sky with each salvo." She taps her chin. "Unles syou rigged up a control that fired cannons each direction at the same time." She stares at some plans. "Also, why don't we use indirect fire if all we're doing is shelling. We can have some boats in the water, and fire onto the island indescriminately."

> (OOC) Nerai says, " Apart from everything else, this is why battleships are so low in the water, for instance."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Also, totally off topic feature request, can you make the 'ooc' command work as expected?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I'm not sure what is 'expected' there, we can talk about that later :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM has connected.

> (OOC) TidesGM peeks in to observe.

Ezra gestures at the ocean. "You can place boatss anywhere, and the murlocss will ssimply sswarm them. The beach ressupply only happenss at sspecific timess, while the murlocss may find the shipss any time before then. Thiss means that we should use an _aerial_ attack. Thuss the zeppelinss."

Nerai hmms, "What if we used some higher speed zeplins, and dropped explosives? We could do it from high enough up, that arrows wouldn't make too bad a difference. We might only get one round at that point, but that might be enough."

The wizard nods. "That iss possible. I had thought the cannonss would allow uss a measure of ssurprise. Can we aim accurate enough bombss at altitudess which permit uss to approach without being noticed?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "the thing I'd proposed to GM is using grapeshot rather than true cannonballs - light enough to destroy personnel on a beach (which is our target currently), but not enough to really damage structures."

"No more or less accurate then trying to fire cannons from airships. Probably." Nerai says. "We could rig up a device to tell people when to drop."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Schrapnel grenades would work about the same way."

"Very well. I leave thiss to you and your goblinss," answers Ezra, tipping his hat and taking his leave.

The second person to approach Nerai is Sookie. "Na, Nerai," the girl asks. "I see Ezra earlier. He say that I have elegant woman inside me. Goblins here say your designs and armor very elegant. Not sure what they mean. But.." Sookie taps her fingertips together. "Teach me what elegant is, okay?"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Oh right. That's easy. :D"

Nerai looks at Sookie. "Hmm... Do you have your page with you?" Nerai says, before she really thinks about it. Words twist and turn in Nerai's mind as she looks at the human girl.

Carefully Sookie unfolds the Torn Book Page and holds it up. Clearly she came prepared for this eventuality.

Nerai hmms, "That woman is elegant, because she upholds the social niceties that humans expect when they interact with eachother." She smiles, "My designs are elegant because they have a simplicity of utility. As is Saeren's hunting. ANd, the way that you deal with barriers is elegant at times, in it's own way. Using what's at hand without a lot of wasted effort." She fumbles around with her words, clearly rambling at being caught off guard.

Sookie listens to all this, looking rather dull. "Um," she says at last. "So. Efficient?"

Nerai hmms, "See, that's one way to think of it, but I don't know if that's what Ezra meant." She ponders, "There's so many ways to be elegant, Sookie. I can teach you mine, but you may just have to find your own." Nerai slups a bit.

"Oh!" The girl perks up a bit. "So.. like your armor. I make dress in Ironforge. You pilot steam armor, it elegant, yah? So I must learn to pilot dress properly. Like that?"

Nerai blinks, "That.. Yeah, that's probably one good wat to think of it. Learning to navigate Human social circles." Nerai grins. Pilot Dress.

"Thanks Nerai!" calls Sookie, dashing off.

The third party that approaches the goblin is... another goblin, by the name of Steamvalve. He's apparently responsible for delivering games and other diversions to Booty Bay, but does a sideline in other cargoes. "Hey! You! Nerai, right? We gotta talk."

Nerai blinks, "How much are ytou offering?" She smiles, and waits just long enough to make him sweat, "Just kidding, what do you need?" She nods.

> (OOC) Saeren has connected.

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Harro."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Hihi"

Steamvalve claps his hands together. "We gotta talk about Ironforge!" he explains. "More specifically, the dwarves. Now, it's been gossip that ya don't really hold truck with the cartels, and that ya don't really see much use in business dealin's, which I frankly can't understand at all. But hey, that's no reason to cut the rest of us out! So I got a business proposition for yas."

Nerai tries really really hard not to make the 'oh god now what' face at him, keeping the smile on her face, "Okay?" She asks, fearing what's coming.

"Well, it's like this. Don't like the cartels ya got? Start yer own! Listen: you can open up whole new business possibilities up north for us." Steamvalve sounds excited, almost giddy. "You know the Venture Company, right? Run it like that - no clan ties, no favoritism, _but_! You can run it the way _you_ want. Don't like some of our, er, more sophisticated business techniques? Fine, you can give the dwarves a fair deal if you want. Build up yer reputation with 'em. Make the other goblins run everything through you, so that way you can say that your uh, honor or whatever, was satisfied. Nobody gets taken to the cleaners, but everyone still wins."

Nerai blinks, "Alright, but what do you want out of it. Sure, I got an 'in' with the Dwarves. But do you know tenuious that is, even after saving like half of them? Rough bunch, you know. Besides, what do you really want to run?"

Steamvalve blinks. "What do I want? Are you kiddin'? Listen, my whole family runs zeppelins. If we were flying cargo up north, we'd make a killing!"

Nerai blinks back, "Sure, but why don't you do it NOW?"

The goblin frowns. "Well, obviously because the dwarves don't deal with us, right? You're different. If we had a shipping business that the dwarves _knew_ you were in charge of, even if we lost a little money by playing nice, that's still a market we're makin' nothing on right now, you know?"

Nerai taps her lips, "I'll keep it in mind the next time I'm in Ironforge. Maybe." She shrugs, "I can't say I've ever been interested in such things though." She turns to leave, wandering to find Saeren or so.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "GM Sanjo!"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "or Nerai can just start talkin directly :)"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "anyway, just do whatever you were gonna do next :) if nothin, GM should go ahead"

> (OOC) Nerai is good.

> (OOC) Nerai needs to idle to do laundry, actually, so...

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All right, let's see how to get things started."

> (OOC) Saeren shoots every naga within 1 million yards.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "basically a planning montage, followed by a trip to Bloodscalp City, followed by Solid Saeren, a box, and a few unnecessary killings."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Depends how you define unnecessary. n.n"

Gromgol's scouts, as always, prepare the way for the attempt to assassinate the Bloodscalp leadership, exploring the jungle and finding paths for those like Saeren, who, for all her experience as a sentinel, is not as familiar with the jungles of Stranglethorn as they.

And amidst their observations, they note that already, not all is going according to the naga plans. At least one Bloodscalp village has already broken away. A coup happened some time in the past week, and now that tribe faces raids from its Tide-touched brethren, and makes counter-raids of its own.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Fortunately I have survival jungle at 15, now :D"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "so Saeren, this is your chance to go talk to Zen'jal - the troll we captured last time, that talked to Kaliera & Era"

> (OOC) Kaliera has connected.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "He is the one we've turned now, right?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "YUp. And he made good on his intent to overthrow his naga-loving leaders."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "You can now make an offer to him: 'want a bigger piece of the pie?'"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Heh."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Where would I find him, GM? I'd imagine he's busy."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Probably leading the village. He'd have some strong trolls aroudn him, but a village this small, you can probably sneak up close enough to go "Psst"."

Knowing now that Zen'jal has shown every intent to hold up his end of the bargain, it is time for Saeren to ask him just how far he'd like to go. Though this land may be unfamiliar, it is hardly difficult for Saeren to find her target with the aid of her fellow scouts. It is even easier for the night elf to slip past the troll guards and interrupt Zen'jal while he takes his evening meal.

The instant Zen'jal hears a strange voice, he's on his feet, and a captured coral axe wedges in one of the support pillars of his hut. "Oh," he says, as he gets a good look at the uninvited visitor. "It you. What you be wantin'?"

"Greetings. It is good to find you still hungry. I come to ask now, just how far does that hunger good? Are you satisfied already, Zen'jal? A touch of flesh and blood is on your lips already." Saeren smiles grimly, "Is this all you want, or would you like to be taste still sweeter meat?"

> (OOC) Nerai idles for food now, be back in a bit.

Zen'jal steps up to the hut's wall, and pauses to tug the axe free. "You pretty bloodthirsty yerself, for a short-tooth," he says, grinning. "Lemme guess. You worried about de odder Bloodscalp, de ones who still suckin up to de naga. I hear dey all over Zul'Kunda already," he adds.

> (OOC) TidesGM notes: http://www.wowwiki.com/Ruins\_of\_Zul%27Kunda - the largest Bloodscalp ruin in northwestern Stranglethorn, and the target of the naga retreat plan.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sorry about the delay there ^^"

Saeren laughs, "I thirst for some blood, but not all, and not quite so directly as your kind." She weighs the troll in her eyes for a time before going on, "And we are not so much worried about them as delighted that we might have a chance to benefit each other once more. It appears the Naga would wish to retreat to Zul'Kunda, where trolls who would live like their pets await them. Imagine how reluctant the Naga would be to flee that way, however, if trolls who are their own masters were instead waiting there. Imagine if you ruled there, Zen'jal."

The troll grimaces. "Don' do me no favors," he mutters, and thrusts his tusked face close. "How it look, huh, if I need de help of outsiders to take over?" His voice drops to a whisper. "How it look if de odder trolls _know_ I owe someone?" And he winks.

"You think I'd ever let a thing like that happen?" asks Saeren. "Let's instead let it be learned that it is I that owe _you_ this task. Besides.." And here, Saeren's weapon turns into a wicked axe. ".. who exactly can tell just who dealt the killing blow? A secret between you and I.. and you with their heads to show as proof."

Zen'jal regards the glistening blue axe blade with obvious longing. "You got a pretty nice weapon dere, mon." He grins again and taps the war-wave's blade lightly with his own. "I could go for dis. Lot of trolls between me an' Gan'zulah, thouh."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "That's really all I need, right? He's going to be ready for the slaughter I'm going to unleash?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "In fact, he's going to want his own people to share in the slaughter. We can handwave the specific preparations."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Shall I pose some connecting stuff before we get on to the slaughter?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Please do :)"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I figured on arranging a time for him to attack, by which point I'll have slaughtered the lines of leadership."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "2 4 6 8, murder death annihilate! GOOOOOO Saeten!"

The two warriors quickly make their plans. Saeren will prepare the way, by picking off key patrols on the route to Zul'kunda's seat of leadership, and Zen'jal will then lead his tribe on the warpath. Few in Zen'jal's tribe will think to question the ease of their assault, or will credit it to Zen'jal's brilliant leadership.

As for Gan'zulah himself, or his head witch-doctor Nezzliok... well, it will be difficult to make plans until they are flushed out. Zen'jal seems to think he can take the other troll in a fight, but if that proves to be more bravado than true combat prowess, well, a watery dart at a crucial moment would be hard to trace back to an outsider.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. Time for Saeren to strut her stuff. Anyone else contributing?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Sookie can detect elemental magic at work and will be pinpointing sources of it."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Ezra is pretty versatile and can support anyone else's efforts pretty well"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Kaliera can drop spells along the way to see if we get seen, as well as tell if we're going to be in danger."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So, time to roll with it, eh?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Phase 1: Open jungle. Occasional troll patrols, in threes and fours. Your mission: Deal with them without allowing any of them to raise the alarm."

> (OOC) Sookie hands over cardboard box

Saeren has taken to the jungle with ease, learning from the scouts of Grom'gol. In a place such as this, her ability to go unseen is amplified. At her side, Shade makes easy work of sniffing-out the enemy patrols. When they are discovered, Saeren sends word to the trolls following her, shooting signal darts back to them with the war wave. The only 'real' arrows she shall fire this day. The enemy discovered, Saeren destroys them, lying in hiding until they are almost on top of her. At near point-blank range, she is able to put arrows through eyes with ease, and in the space of three seconds four trolls lie dead.

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Also Kaliera has brewed some poisons."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Truly I think at that range I could probably kill them in two seconds, but who's counting?"

> (OOC) TidesGM poses some as well.

The next patrol does not face a deadly night-elf sentinel. Instead, it faces a band of angry war trolls. Three of them quickly fall to the axes of Zen'jal and his followers, and the fourth flees into the jungle, only to be struck by a blowdart.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Kaliera, pose for me some suitably spectacular poison victim symptoms."

The troll takes another step, then stops. His eyes bulge as he grasps his throat, then his chest. The blue of his skin deepens, deepens, as the poison paralyzes his lungs, and he falls over, unable to breathe, unable to speak... only able to die.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Kaliera's poisons.. hm. Could we use them in bombs? A thought for later :)"

Zen'jal looks at the dartgun in his hand in wonder. "Wow. An' I called her wussy. Hate ta have her brewin poisons _against_ me." He grins again, sticking the dartgun back in the bandolier and charging forward.

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "That poison was brewed specifically for this situation. After all, if they can't breathe, they can't shout alerts or blow horns"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Mission succeeded!"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Phase 2: The outskirts of Zul'kunda. Patrols are too thick to silence. Your mission: help make sure Zen'jal's trolls find their way to the enemy leadership, without anyone realizing that they are being guided by outsiders. Leading pose to begin:"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK, belaying that last pose. I misunderstood the PC's plan."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. Sookie, take over posing for now."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "coming up in a sec"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All right. We'll reinstate that pose, but with a twist after."

Eventually, Zen'jal's war party reaches the outer walls of Zul'Kunda, and the alarm goes up. There is no more time for secrecy - but without any advance notice, the enemy Bloodscalp are too few to mount a significant defense. The wall patrols go down quickly, and Zen'jal and his buddies are over the walls. "Now where be Gan'zulah," he mutters to himself.

Sookie, however, already knows where Gan'zulah is likely to be. The naga's chalices of Dagun each have a bound water elemental, and she can spot them for miles, through walls. And she can fly - and she learned long ago that all too few guards think to look _up_ for enemies.

> (OOC) Sookie o\_o b

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sookie ftw n.n"

So as the commotion goes up on the outer walls, the adventurers are already headed skyward. The night is dark, and the moon is but a sliver in the sky - a perfect night for an aerial stealth mission.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK, /now/ Bill takes over."

Sookie doesn't have Saeren's elven grace, blessed by Elune and honed over a thousand years of battle. What she does have is mud, and plenty of it. With a thick coating of mud over skin and a layer of furs, she's quite sure that nothing will reflect. The only fear now is that she might occlude the moon, or a star, and charts her course carefully to avoid such accidental slips. For Saeren, a slightly more sophisticated solution was presented by Ezra: a continuous invisibility spell. Silence will be the elf's duty to provide.

A few jungle animals have been negotiated with - for a few days of free sustenance, they will create a convincing distraction on one side of the troll city, aiming to get the trolls' eyes to look in that direction. Sookie will fly through the gap in surveillance this creates, using the thick canopy of trees to mask her approach, and trusting luck to drop Saeren right at the doorstep of the Bloodscalp's leadership.

And so as the commotion arises, thanks to Kaliera's influence over food and beast, Sookie and Saeren dart silently overhead. The girl dips as low as she dares, pointing with a slime-encrusted hand at the ramshackle arrangement of rock, leaf and vine that marks the Bloodscalp chieftain's 'tent'. And she releases Saeren, flying skyward again to await the signal to pick up.

This far into the camp, most of the trolls are still asleep. They trust their companions to awaken them if there's real trouble - and although the shouting from the walls is audible here, it isn't enough to penetrate their dreams. But as Saeren makes her way past the other tents, her sharp ears notice an oddity in the pattern of snoring. Some of the sleepers in the tent ahead of her don't sound quite like trolls.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "It's over to you, Saeren. We'll have a bit of back-and-forth, depending on what you do about this."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "And yes, they're naga."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sorry, back now ><"

Saeren can detect the sound of strange troll snores. To her ears, the sound of naga breathing is distinct. Few hunters alive know it better. She does not divert her course, but stores this information later. A few naga to deal with will not distract her at this point.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "They are a goal for later.. for now, I have to take this place out. How many are there?"

Saeren instead moves tent to tent, seeking a sign that will tip her off. She needs to find their leaders, and swiftly.

Fortunately for Saeren's search, leaders - particularly troll leaders - tend to have particular modes of thinking. She finds Gan'zulah's tent the same way she'd found Zen'jal's - the biggest, most important-looking one, with the most fearsome decorations over the door. And also, the only one with awake trolls standing outside, looking right through Saeren - though one of them is raising its head and sniffing suspiciously.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So basically I am to reveal the position and that's all for now, or is this a 'kill' moment? Not entirely clear."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Anyway, I think I get the plan.."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. Well, this is mostly Ezra's plan, so he would've been the one briefing you, under normal circumstances. If you kill him, there would have to be some way for Zen'jal to take credit; if you just reveal the position, there's a risk that Zen'jal won't live to get there."

With the target's location determined, Saeren slips away, moving towards where she knows the attackers shall be. A predetermined token is laid out on the ground, a rock that will not draw too much attention, but that Zen'jal will know the meaning of. With this guidance in place, Saeren starts to focus on her next task: slaughtering the guards and dealing with the naga.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'll lead him there and destroy those that might be a problem. The 'signal' for Sookie is going to be all hell breaking loose, I think."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "She's good with that sort of singal."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "As I noted, you don't so much order Sookie as unleash her and stay out of the radius."

Saeren focuses first on the naga, her darts ready to give them the choice. With a bit of luck, she'll get at least one ally in the process. Finding the naga again is trivial for Saeren. Shooting them with arrows while they sleep, well, it's hardly challenging, as well.

> (OOC) Nerai says, "She's just Fire and forget."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "How many naga?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "About a dozen - including three in the leaders' tent."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Oi vey, this will be fun."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Are they awake inside?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "No one seems to be awake except the leader's bodyguards. How long that'll last if naga start crying out after being shot with arrows and not turned into lamia..."

Saeren hears the dim noise of Zen'jal's war party not far in the distance when she decides to launch her attack. She is relying on surprise. And shortly she'll no doubt be needing the destructive power of Sookie. Her first targets are the bodyguards. They are strong, to be sure, but at the range Saeren is able to get it should make little difference. Two arrows are fired, and the War Wave finds their eyes.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I don't think these guys will get to raise any alarm."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Hell, I even get to aim n.n"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Nooo, not really. Proceed with the rest of your targets."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "sooner or later somebody is gonna run in here to tell the boss what's going on n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "No doubt. And I'm hoping that Sookie will deal with that in her own colorful way :D"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "We have radios and such, so we can coordinate this, yeah"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "From the sounds of Zen'jal's team, the messenger with the 'We're being attacked' message is going to be a few minutes yet. He won't be hiding, so eyes in the sky should spot him in time."

Saeren slinks away into the shadows, looking for her next targets. She aims for the naga that will be first in the warpath. She doesn't aim to kill, but to redeem. Still, with so many naga near at hand, her shooting comes fast, and by the time the first shot are realizing what is happening, she has already let fly six arrows.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm going to try mass-conversion with autofire n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I wonder how many I get out of six n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "also, dinner warning. :)"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I have about three minutes, then I must go eat."

> (OOC) TidesGM \*roll\* \*roll\*

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Uh-oh, my life depends on dices."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "This is your lucky day, you get three of them."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All females. This is an all-chick party here."

> (OOC) Kaliera calls Vivid Video for 'Naga Priestesses Gone Wild'

Three of the naga shake themselves and shed their scales. The other three rise from their slumber, clutching for the shaft of an arrow that has already dissolved into liquid water, and preparing to call out the alarm..

Saeren gives them no more choices. As they rise to deal with the intruder they are decimated. The night elf has no mercy to show them, and unprepared as they are, they pose no threat to her. The third attempts to bring her magic to bear only to have two of her turned comrades bring her down. Their more practical use of daggers proves quite effective. There was some noise, but Saeren does not wait to see if any have roused. She whispers, "Come with me swiftly!"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "More... very quickly."

Saeren darts away, making for another tent. She can hear that the enemy is rousing about her, and opens fire point blank. Three naga lie inside the chief's tent, and three here. Sensing the trolls coming now, she will make quick work of this tent, and direct her arrows at the final target as swiftly as she may. Hopefully just in time for those who turn to slip away, and those who don't will be up to their throats in troll axes.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I gotta afk to eat n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Basic plan is clear.. try to convert, and if they don't, interfere..."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "afk now :O"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Hm. I wanted to pose the battle getting close enough to start waking people, but now I don't know where to go with it."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "What's Sookie doing during all this? Is there anyone except Sookie, Saeren, and Zen'jal's people on the offensive?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "k, I'll go."

One of the Tide-touched trolls darts through the shadowy ruins of ancient grandeur to alert his superiors about the attackers. Not the chieftain, that is - the _real_ superiors, the naga. He makes it as far as the steps and begins to yell, only to make a **gurk**ing noise. Then his neck snaps.

Another follows a few moments later. As he leans down to examine the body of his fellow, letting down his guard, he discovers exactly what fate befell the first messenger. A muddy monster emerges from the shadows, taking hold of both corpses and dragging them out of sight.

By the time the commotion gets close enough to begin waking the trolls of its own accord, Saeren has her lamia allies concealed in a shadowy tumbled-down ruin nearby, and has left half a dozen slowly cooling naga corpses behind, as well as any troll who was foolish enough to be a light sleeper - and Sookie has a small pile of hapless messengers stashed in nearby underbrush. The chaos in Gan'zulah's camp, as they discover their new aquatic allies assassinated or missing, must be seen to be believed.

"<Spread out!>" shouts Gan'zulah. "<Find de killer! I want 'is head!>" Burly troll warriors rush in all directions. And a few seconds later, a half dozen troll heads roll back into the plaza. Zen'jal stalks up behind them, licking his axe blade.

"<Nice ruins you got here,>" says the rebel troll. "<T'ink I'll take 'em.>" And he leaps at the Bloodscalp chieftain, axe at the ready.

---

Normally, when a troll kills the tribe's leader, that troll is immediately accepted as the new chieftain. But normally, the entire tribe had not been put to the chalice first.

This is where the Aggramar Catalyst comes in. Whenever a group of Tide-touched Bloodscalp rushes in, a quick storm of watery arrows snaps them out of their sorcerous thrall, and as their eyes clear, they kneel before the bearer of Gan'zulah's head.

> (OOC) Saeren returns!

> (OOC) Sookie says, "alright. Commence scheming:"

Not all those that bow to Zen'jal's might are trolls. Ezra steps forward, deferentially bowing, and when acknowledged begins speaking quietly. He withdraws a sealed letter from the pockets of his coat and presents it, along with a smaller note inscribed in the trolls' own tongue. Zen'jal reads it carefully, with narrowed eyes, then begins giving orders: any trolls still possessing gills are to drink - by force if necessary - from a particular cup, or grail. Those trolls not acknowledging him as Bloodscalp chieftain are to be put to death. And a messenger is to be sent to the Zandalari trolls of Yojamba Isle, thanking them for their patronage and the loan of certain weapons made of magical water, which were instrumental in the defeat of the Tide-touched.

The involvement of an obvious non-troll causes some consternation amongst Zen'jal's new subjects - but as word spreads that the Zandalari are Zen'jal's sponsors, there is general rejoicing. All too many of the former Tide-touched remember far too well what it was like to be _compelled_ to take orders from the water-witches, and are grateful to the Zandalari for their salvation.

Ezra quickly leaves - no need to stay around for the celebration feast, after all - and locates Saeren, Kaliera and the others. Quickly he explains the final part of this particular plan: the messenger that Zen'jal sends to the Zandalari brings a letter. In short it states: "We lied about your involvement, but you will want in on this business anyway. Contact Grom'gol Base Camp for details."

The new-fledged lamia Anjali, the most senior amongst Saeren's newest compatriots, explains that their role had been to act as ambassadors to Gan'zulah and his inner circle, and to direct the creation of the gate beacon that would lead the naga to Zul'Kunda if the Haunted Isle were beset. "Why am I not surprised that _you_ were our foe all along, Ezra?" she asks, a hint of her former cruelty showing in her amused smile.

"Perhapss that may become gratitude that I am now your ally," the wizard suggests sardonically. "Regardless, we musst now move againsst the isle."

"And swiftly," agrees Saeren. The night elf is pleased to have won so many for her growing family, but it does not breed patience in her. "The faster we move, the more likely we are to deny them a chance at escape."

"I will help you however I can in that endeavour," says Anjali. "But now that you have cut off our - no, _their_ retreat, I can't imagine that you would _need_ much further help."

"You can help with thiss question. If not here, then where will they run?" asks Ezra.

The lamia shakes her head. "Nowhere. Without any way to continue their mission, they will make their stand on the Haunted Isle, hoping to take out as many of you as they can. They will send a magical message to Nazjatar as a warning, but they will not return there in failure. What would be the point?"

"If given the chance to ssurrender and retreat unharmed.. will they?" The wizard is curious on this point - the Tide-touched show no such self-protective instincts, but their masters might.

"Queen Azshara is... not very tolerant of failure," Anjali says sadly. "But that is not the only consideration. Lady Nar'dana is a true believer in Dagun's cause, and she will order her people to fight to the last woman. But there may be others who would..." She holds up her hand, fingers spread, to display the lack of webbing. "Who would contemplate Lady Saeren's alternative."

Ezra grips the head of his cane in frustration. "I ssuppose it would be useless to point out that an orderly retreat meanss more naga to fight another day; reasson iss not a trait of the fanatic. But very well. Come! I have more quesstionss, and you and your companionss are doubtlessly tired."
