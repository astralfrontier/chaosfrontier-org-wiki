Grom'gol Base Camp is back in business. The zeppelin routes to Booty Bay are resuming, and the Horde's overland routes to Stonard once again fear only the wild animals and jungle trolls of Stranglethorn, rather than the naga chalice. And they play host to a group from the Explorer's League from Ironforge. For political reasons, the flag the dwarves fly today is that of the Covenant - under which the Horde will not attack. Still, peace isn't always peaceful. Aggro'gosh has sworn to throw anyone who mentions the word "haggis" into the ocean.

A message from the orcish settlement of Stonard has arrived as well: reinforcements are needed to deal with a naga presence in the Swamp of Sorrows to the northeast. "The Horde will deal with this problem," Aggro'gosh assures the adventurers. "But if the naga send forces through Deadwind Pass, they will have access to the rivers around the human kingdom of Stormwind. Paugh! Not that I care, you know. But I'll not have it said that we ran from this fight either. Go tell the humans."

Ezra has a modification to this plan. He'll send another of his magically conjured clones to Stonard, while the real wizard heads to Kalimdor. A visit to the dragons cannot wait. Before leaving himself, he opens a gate back to Ironforge for his companions: "They'll need to be updated. Keep traveling. Stormwind awaitss." And he tosses Kagarn his cane, the Lamplighter. "I have placed much of my power in thiss. If I do not return, a successor to the Sacred Fire may arise. You will know them, becausse they will sseek you out for your blessing. Give them thiss, and wissh them well."

> (OOC) Saeren poses n.n

Saeren raises an eyebrow at this pronouncement. Says replies quickly, "Don't think you'll be rid of us so easily, Ezra! We'll meet again, in any case."

The wizard nods, but says nothing. He seems thoughtful and distracted.

Kaliera bows formally. "May the Light, in the form most comforting to you, keep you safe in the dark places you may walk, Ezra Pyreborn."

Sookie has been spending all of her time at the Altar of Naias. With the news from Grom'gol that people are leaving, she's flown back to revisit the group. "Spirits of water grant my wish," she announces, taking up her usual position beside Kagarn.

With that, the founders of the Covenant make their way back to Ironforge, in the company of two goblin airship pilots tasked with piloting the _Defiant_ to Booty Bay. For the time being, that worthy vessel will serve as the flagship of Booty Bay's air force - and, as such, it will remain on the front lines of the war on the seas.

Besides, the messengers of Hydraxis have conveyed a message to Kagarn. The nations of the Covenant have not been idle, and they have prepared new resources to support the Covenant's emissaries...

---

The draenei - who, in a real sense, could be considered the first members of the Covenant - have supplied most of the industrial base and the crystal-engineering. The Forsaken and the orcs have supplied their share of arcane know-how. And the Argent Dawn, fresh from their victory over Naxxramas, have supplied secrets gleaned from the Scourge necropoli and sanctified by the Light.

The result now hovers over the Ironforge airfield. A gleaming, silvery toroid fifty yards in diameter, with six sturdy yet graceful metallic struts, like the spokes of a wheel, connecting the perimeter to the central drive assembly of shimmering violet crystal. Additional crystals are mounted along the spokes, against the outer hull, provide the levitational force.

Exarch Menelaous himself, along with an entourage, disembarks to greet Saeren, Kagarn, Kaliera, and Sookie. "Greetings, old friends and new," he says, bowing deeply. "And my best wishes to Ezra Pyreborn and Nerai, wherever they may be."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "One more."

"I have come as a military advisor, to work with the armed forces of Ironforge and coordinate our response to the servants of the Old God," he continues. "I will be stationed here for the duration - and I have been instructed that this vessel will be at your disposal, to support the business of the Covenant of the Grail."

Sookie's eyes are alight. "It's really shiny," she whispers, raptly watching the artifact hover.

Kaliera bows deeply in return. "Nerai is taking the lead in the rebuilding of Booty Bay, honored Exarch; and the honored Pyreborn is traveling northward, to speak to the residents of the Dragonshrine." She looks to the sky. "The ship is most impressive."

"Greetings Exarch," begins Saeren. She looks to the ship, studying it. "I wonder what it will feel like compared to our usual means of getting from place to place."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone want to come up with a name for it? :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "If not, i'll pull one out of my... hat."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "'Ooh Shiny' will probably be shot down I take it"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Probably n.n"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "'Defiant II' n.n"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "thesaurus to the rescue!"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "WTB Mage Portal"

"The _Audacious_ was inspired party by the work Ezra and Nerai did on your former airship home, of course," says Menelaous. "But you will find that it is considerably more durable, for it is not dependent on an easily perforated dirigible envelope."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "another"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "actually, never mind. We'll consider the gearing up to be off-camera, and if you wish to RP out your acquiring of gear, I'm more than happy to accomodate you in side-sessions."

Kagarn bows deeply. "We are in your debt, good sir, and the arrival of this craft is most fortuitous - for our present mission requires conveyance for more than just a few adventurers." He beckons, and Talasa slithers forward, along with several other lamia. "How fare our sisters in Kalimdor, Menelaous?" she asks courteously.

Menelaous bows in response. "Lady Ssatha's subjects grow by the day," he replies. "The Azuremyst Isles are secure, and her numbers have grown enough that she has sent an expedition to harry the naga of Desolace from the seaward front."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Any response, or shall we move forward and get on with resettling Talasa's people?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "not from Sookie :)"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "nope!"

"This is marvelous news," replies Talasa. "You may send a message back to Tides' Hollow that the lamia nation is about to be founded on this continent as well." The exarch bows deeply and steps aside to allow the adventurers and the lamia to come aboard.

---

The first stop of the _Audacious_ is the dwarven land of Loch Modan, nearby to the east. The loch is not a natural formation - it is an artifical reservoir held in place by the great Stonewrought Dam - and its fishlife forms a key part of the 'breadbasket' of Ironforge. However, rampaging murlocs have interfered with Thelsamar's fishing industry, and King Bronzebeard has granted the loch as a homestead for the lamia, in return for restraining, taming, or driving off the fishmen, and whatever other barbarians threaten the lake and its dwarven people.

The next step of the journey takes the Covenant much further south - and this time the way has not been prepared for them. "Our relations with Stormwind have been tentative, of late," explained Senator Redstone, "but we do know that the human village of Lakeshire, in the Redridge Mountains, is beset from many sides, and that they have had to rely on their own resources for their protection. Don't ask _me_ why Stormwind doesn't send any support." He shrugged. "We've sent a messenger to tell them to expect you, but you'll have to negotiate with them yourselves."

The _Audacious_ spends the better part of a week traversing the hostile lands from the loch to Redridge. On this occasion, they give Blackrock Mountain a wide berth - but as they fly across the deserts in its distant shadow, there are unmistakable glimpses of black dragons and their dragonkin even this far to the east. One drake even shadows the _Audacious_ for a tense half-day before going about its dark business.

Kaliera spends time getting parts of the ship in what she considers 'order': setting up the kitchens, making sure the bunks are taken care of, and generally doing housekeeping. It seems to keep her both occupied and cheerful.

Seeing the black dragons, Saeren asks of others more familiar with this area, "Is it so normal for them to be spread so far from the mountain?"

> (OOC) TidesGM answers Saeren's question.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "And since /no one/ is particularly familiar with the area..."

Kagarn shakes his head. "I am told that this is far from the areas that the dwarves of Ironforge regularly travel - if any of our allies live or scout these lands, it is the humans. We shall have to ask the denizens of Lakeshire such questions."

"We will have to," agrees Saeren.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone have anything else?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "not for the moment"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "na"

---

The windward side of the Redridge Mountains is a welcome relief from the smoldering deserts at the foot of Blackrock. It is still somewhat arid, but trees grow here, and plant and animal life flourish. A stone fortification passes underneath, bearing the unmistakable signs of human architecture. "Stonewatch Keep," says Kagarn, consulting a map. "Give it a wide berth - the Blackrock orcs hold it now."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "continuing unless someone wishes to comment"

Sookie eyes Kagarn. "Make up mind. You like orc or not?"

"These orcs are rebels against the Horde," replies Kagarn. "They recognize an orc named Rend Blackhand as their Warchief, and make war on Thrall's Horde whenever they meet. That is all I know about them."

Sookie nods in slow understanding. "Na, goshi. Tell me and I go straighten out orcs."

Kagarn looks over the notes given to him by Senator Redstone. "It may come to that," he admits. "But we must speak with the humans first. It would be dangerous, even for you, to engage the Blackrock without knowing what to expect."

> (OOC) Sookie got nothin else

Kaliera says, "It sounds as if that will be something we need to find a way to address."

"The archer who aims at too many targets at once misses them every time," says Saeren. "One shot at a time.. but I do not disagree that we will have to deal with this issue as well, someday."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Gm, please swap my pose.."

Lakeridge is nestled at the western edge of Lake Everstill. It seems peaceful enough, with humans going about their normal business. But the bridge that spans the bay beside the lake tells a different story. The stone span has been heavily damaged by siege engines, and wooden makeshift repairs make it only barely serviceable. There is a small stockpile of quarried stone beside the bridge, but not nearly enough to repair it.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Done."

"The human lands," whispers Saeren. "I wonder just what greeting we'll have this time?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "We're as welcome as the black plague, generally n.n"

This time, the greeting seems cordial, at least. A bearded, elderly man introduces himself as Magistrate Solomon. "The dwarves told us to expect you," he says. "You are... the Covenant of the Grail, correct? Would you be so good as to introduce yourselves?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "So who wants to do the talking, now that you don't have Ezra around? n.n"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "probably me. :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "WOuld be appreciated. You do have Diplomacy on your sheet, do you not?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Indeed I do! As well as Public Speaking."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "So do you know what you're hoping to accomplish here? You have a number of lamia on board who need a home where they'll be safe from the naga until they have the numbers to take the fight to them."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Yup. First things first, though."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Also, is the Exarch with us still?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Nope. The Audacious dropped him off in IF."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "OK. Is Talasa the only lamia with us, or are there others? Just so I can get it straight."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "There are others on the ship."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "ok!"

Kaliera steps forwards and bows formally. "Greetings, Magistrate Solomon. I am the Anchorite Kaliera, and I greet you in the name of the Covenant. My companions are," and here she gestures to each to step forwards, "the archer Saeren Finblighter and her companion, the redoubtable Shade; Kagarn, shaman of the Earthen Ring; Sookie, mistress of elements. Also with us is Lady Talasa of the lamia and her retinue. It is our honor to meet you."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "ack, forgot to edit that out x.x"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "edit in post o.o"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "While we're at it, we need to edit out Finblighter, don't we? n.n"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Saeren hasnt give me a new last name yet, so still using it until told otherwise. :)"

> (OOC) Kaliera pokethpoketh Saeren in the surname

> (OOC) TidesGM edits out Menelaous.

Solomon returns Kaliera's bow, and then peers at Talasa through his monocle. "So this is what lamia look like," he says. "Hm. Never heard of your kind before, I must say. Still, welcome one and all to Lakeshire. What is your business here?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sorry about that, it's Moon-Mother these days :)"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I believe that was the one that was settled upon, ne?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Okay! I'll remember that for later."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I assume someone's working on responding to Solomon's question?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "yes"

Kaliera says, "The lamia seek places to reside while they build their forces enough to take the battles to the naga and their allies and slaves. It was suggested that Redridge, having a very large lake, might be a place where they could establish a colony, as they have both in Kalimdor as well as Loch Modan, where they can assist with both security and the fishing industry, for mutual benefit. We have come here to petition for this to be allowed, since it impacts your people directly and is not something that Stormwind would care about, from what I have heard."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "more""

Kaliera says, "I would propose we have a gathering where you and your advisors can ask your questions and find out more of these people. They are generous of spirit, as they have known slavery and found those chains unpleasant to bear. But you must make your decision as you see fit; I merely ask now that we be allowed some time to convince you of their honest desires."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "okay, Kaliera's first shot is fired."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "It's far less painful than mine. :)"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "that's why it's dipmicy and not archery. :)"

Solomon rubs his chin. "I..." he says, looking doubtful. "I have to tell you, Miss... Kaliera?... times have been rather tough in these parts. I feel for your lamia friends there, but like you say, Stormwind doesn't seem to care too much about us these days, and it seems like we're constantly under attack - if it's not orcs, it's gnolls. Why, if it weren't for Lady Lainsborough-"

"I thought I heard my ears burning," calls a sharp voice from the town hall. A woman emerges - no, as Solomon said, this is definitely a lady. She would not necessarily be called beautiful - 'handsome' might be a better word - but she moves with a certain bearing as she appraches the travelers, striding directly up to Kaliera. "Is this your noisy contraption, young lady?" she says, inclining her head toward the _Audacious_.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "For the record, the Audacious runs quite soundlessly, at least as far as the ears are concerned."

Kaliera smiles very slightly, and bows again. "We have been granted use of it by the makers for travel. The Covenant of the Chalice greets you, Lady Lainsborough."

Lainsborough allows herself a rather more generous smile in return. "Well, you can tell the makers they did a pretty good job." She turns to the magistrate. "Did you tell them about the murlocs yet?" she says.

Solomon shakes his head. "I was getting to that. I haven't had much time to worry about them, since unlike the orcs and gnolls, they stay pretty much to themselves. But Lady Lainsborough tells me that they've been increasing greatly in number over the past year, and that she's quite certain they're up to no good."

> (OOC) Saeren poses..

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Also going to include some indication of some of my goodies that I'm buying.."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "You guys are assumed to have your goodies by now."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Then Kaliera has set up the kitchen and the alchemy lab by now on the Audacious."

"We're accustomed to such issues," replies Saeren. "And if desired, we will be of assistance." She steps forward to greet the Lady, bowing. When she moves, however, there isn't so much as a sound in her motions, nor even coming from her armor or other gear. "I will ensure that in founding a new home for my sisters and brothers we show our worth in deed and word to those would have as our neighbors."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Basically I'm kinda eerie in silence I suppose. Fun toys n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "No scent, either, if there's anyone to note that kind of thing."

"Well spoken, young lady," says Lainsborough. She glances up at the clock tower. "Ah, it's teatime. Won't you all join me? We have much more to discuss, I believe."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Any objections to taking tea with the Lady and Solomon and assorted nameless counselors?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Nope."

Kaliera says, "If you will excuse me one moment, Lady Lainsborough?" She goes into the Audacious, returning a short moment later with a covered plate. "As we are visiting, it is, I think, proper that I should offer cakes to go with tea." She had made them earlier for dessert with dinner, but diplomacy has its needs..."

"Well done!" says Lainsborough, clapping her hands together and obviously pleased. "So good to meet travelers who understand the virtues of courtesy and manners!" She nods to the magistrate. "Why don't you go and tell the others they are invited to tea as well?"

> (OOC) Sookie will be hangin out with Kagarn and drinkin' tea and whatnot

Tea is taken in Lady Lainsborough's home, at the northwestern outskirts of town. The exterior resembles the somewhat rustic homesteads that the commoners of Lakeshire use for dwellings; on the inside, however, the adventurers find a home truly fit for nobility - and one that seems far too large for one woman to dwell in. The dining room table is fit for a banquet - and clearly has seen much use as an unofficial council chamber, from the way the town's leadership seems familiar with their place settings.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Hm."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "hmm?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Do we need to bring a chair for Kagarn, who might be a bit large for the standard seating, as well as something for the lamia to use?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I think even a night elf might have a bit of an issue considering things :)"

Kagarn regards the banquet table with puzzlement, observing chairs clearly intended for human occupation. Lady Lainsborough shakes her head, smiling, and returns quietly with a chair large enough for the tauren. "I'm afraid I can't accommodate you, Talana," says the lady regretfully. "It is quite all right, Lady Lainsborough," replies the lamia. "Our people do not customarily sit upon chairs." Talana demonstrates by moving one of the chairs aside, then curling her tail neatly under herself.

And for Kaliera, there is a stool which, remarkably, manages to match precisely with the rest of the place settings. For a common noblewoman, Lainsborough seems remarkably well prepared to entertain guests of all shapes and sizes.

Sookie is probably the only person who needs no accommodations. While the others adjust, she spends her time peering about the place, craning her neck and studying everything in silent curiosity.

Kaliera sits, leaving her staff near the door, making sure her new robes don't get caught on things. (they're slightly longer than the old, and she's not quite used to them yet.)

Marshal Marris, leader of the Lakeridge militia, is by far the most suspicious of the newcomers - but even he knows better than to interrupt Lady Lainsborough when she is serving tea. The instant she has taken her seat, though, he starts in. "You can't seriously be thinking of entertaining these... these lamia, Solomon!" he says. "You know the fishing has been bad lately, and we can't do any farming with those damn gnolls rooting up the fields. There isn't _room_ for them!"

Lady Lainsborough smiles at Marris. "You know well why the fishing has been poor, Marshal. And who better to deal with the murlocs but a people who can, apparently, swim just as well as they?"

Sookie speaks up. "Na, if gnolls do bad, we help stop. If that make you okay with lamia in lake, we help. Just ask."

Lady Lainsborough's nose wrinkles, and she stares at Sookie for a long moment - not as if studying her, but as if considering her response. "We appreciate the offer, child. May I speak with you in private after tea is completed?"

The girl nods. "Is good tea too."

Kaliera is beginning to suspect that Lady Lainsborough is more than just a provincial noble. Far more. But there are things one does not bring up at tea.

Saeren turns to the Marshal and studies him silently for a moment. "If murlocs are the issue, simply point us in the right direction." She has an endless supply of arrows, after all.

Marris looks up and down along the table. "Well... you lot are certainly... adventurers," he admits, grudgingly. "I can give you what I know about the gnolls and the murlocs. If you can do something to get them to stop raiding us and eating our fish, be my guest."

"Leave the murlocs to me and my people," says Talana. "We would just as soon not resort to bloodshed, but we have a natural affinity with their kind. We may be able to persuade them to leave peacefully. And if we cannot... well, as Lady Lainsborough said, we are also better suited to fight them than you - than ordinary land-dwellers."

A decision is reached, of sorts. The people of Lakeshire cannot make room for the lamia on their own - but they have no objection if the lamia and the Covenant do so. Marris conveys what he knows about the primitive and tribal gnolls, and what little he knows about the murlocs that settle the shores of Everstill.

And once teatime is over, the adventurers are left with the Lady. "Now young lady - Sookie, was it? Where did you learn Common?"

Sookie glances at Kagarn, who nods approvingly. With that out of the way, the girl herself answers. "Raised by Twilight's Hammer. Few years ago, run away. Ordered by keeper. Hurragh, orc matron of clan. She teach. Other clan members include human. They also teach."

Lainsborough maintains eye contact throughout the explanation. "Obviously, you ran off before they were finished teaching you, then. But why teach you Common at all?"

Again Sookie glances at Kagarn for approval. "Sent to destroy Stormwind by clan." She holds up her wrists, showing the metal bracers eternally affixed there. "Made as weapon. Goshi and Saeren and Nerai teach, say no need be weapon. But still learn."

"So you were sent to destroy Stormwind..." says Lainsborough, considering this for a moment. Then she smiles broadly. "Good."

"That not what everyone else say," mutters Sookie.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone else reacting to that, before I go on?"

Kaliera raises an eyebrow at that. But there's something going on here and she will not speak... for now.

"What precisely is good about it?" asks Saeren.

Lainsborough smiles knowingly at everyone. "Have any of you been to Stormwind lately? No? Then you wouldn't understand." She sobers, shaking her head. "Don't misunderstand me. I don't want to see the _people_ destroyed, or even its buildings. No... but Stormwind has lost its way. The nobility of Stormwind have forgotten what they were supposed to be. Or worse, they don't care.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "more"

"You heard the councilmen talking about it at teatime," continues Lainsborough. " Stormwind has left Lakeshire to its own devices - and it's not just us. Westfall, Grand Hamlet, Raven Hill... all of them, abandoned, while Stormwind takes our best warriors and sends them gallivanting around the world on heaven knows what errands. They have responsibilities... and they are ignoring them. _That_ is the Stormwind that needs to be destroyed."

Sookie thinks about this for a moment. "Show me on map, and I destroy," she offers with a big smile. "Leave rest alone, promise."

Lady Lainsborough shakes her head. "You misunderstand me, young lady. That Stormwind cannot be found on any map. It is a state of mind, an attitude. And from the look of you, you may very well be the one to do it, but you won't be able to until you know what I'm talking about - and you _certainly_ won't be able to do it if you talk like an ape!"

Sookie scowls. "Not ape. Half-elemental. What wrong with how I talk?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "a question which answers itself, really."

Saeren brushes that one aside. "Lady Lainsborough, I have no skill in these matters. What are you suggesting we do? Our goal here is not to change Stormwind, but it seems that such a change would certainly support our purpose. Why are the warriors scattered? Why does no one do anything about it?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Why is it a black dragon is hanging out in your capital? >.>"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Why do bandits suddenly appear / why do orcs bring such fear / the answer's clear / Katrana Prestor is here / too close, too...."

Lainsborough says, "I have my suspicions. But the long and the short of it is this: the king is missing. In his place is his ten-year-old son, looked after by Bolvar Fordragon, and the city is ruled by the regent, Katrana Prestor. And _she_... she can think of nothing but the glory of Stormwind, and making war on the Horde and whatever other enemies she can think up. I'd say she's hardly a noblewoman at all, if it weren't for the fact that half the nobles in Stormwind seem to worship the ground she walks on."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "she's Garrosh in drag"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "...I'm not sleeping tonight now."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Any further commentary? If not, I've got one last bit."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Go for it! I think we each need like, another 400 xp or so to deal with Prestor.."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "And like $2,000,000 in gear n.n"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Ezra actually has an awesome plan for this. once he gets back n.n"

Lainsborough shakes her head once again, and turns to Kagarn. "This Sookie keeps looking at you every time I ask her a question. Why is that?"

Kagarn bows deeply. "As an elemental, she is bound to me. I am her keeper."

"And a right hash you've made of it too," replies Lainsborough. "No, don't look so shocked. You've had how long to look after her? and _your_ Common is picture-perfect, so why haven't you bothered to teach _her_ how to speak it properly?"

Kagarn sighs deeply, rubbing his horn. "I am a shaman, milady. I can teach her how to be an elemental, but I am not prepared to teach her how to be human."

Lainsborough folds her arms. "Being human isn't enough."
