A series of teleports places Ezra in the deserts of Tanaris. He's been here before, when the group ventured south to bring Valstann Staghelm back to life. He remembers enough to get him into the region; line of sight from a high altitude is enough to place him at the forbidding black maw of the Caverns of Time.

A bronze-scaled dragon steps out of the shadowed gateway. "Your presence was anticipated," booms its voice, fairly shaking the sands from the wizard's boots.

Ezra tips his hat politely. "I would be greatly dissappointed if it wass not," he answers with a smirk.

He finds himself flown quickly and efficiently through a series of underground tunnels, emerging into an impossibly large cavern. Overhead, the night sky is visible rather than the unhewn stone of a cave. Set down by his draconic escort, he surveys the scene before him.

Two dozen fully-grown bronze dragons are lined up in perfect formation, creating an avenue between them that leads to a raised stone platform at the center of the colossal cave. Waiting there are three humanoid figures. Even from here, Ezra recognizes one of them as Letodormu.

He begins walking forward. Crossing the shadow of even one of the dragons takes a dozen strides, and there are a dozen more shadows before he comes face to face with his hosts.

"I am Letodormu. I advocate reversal," announces the dragon Ezra remembers from before. Opposite him, another dragon, wearing the guise of a female high elf, responds ritually. "I am Shayedormi. I advocate acceptance." Between this pair is a night elf. A moment is all it takes for Ezra to perceive that she is not a dragon at all, but rather a thing of magic, like a complicated illusion. "I am Leyara. I am the oracle."

Ezra waits; clearly something is happening here, and if an explanation will serve him, one will be given. His suspicions are confirmed after a few seconds. Shayedormi speaks.

"Ezra L. Pyreborn, you have come seeking power. We know the purpose to which you propose that power be put, and we have seen how you have used the magic of the Sands of Time. We know of your mission to the War of the Shifting Sands. This is your trial. If you are judged worthy, you will be granted that which you came for. If you are found wanting, you will never leave this place. And if you present a sufficient danger, you will never have come here at all."

Letodormu takes over. "During this trial, we will consult the timeways. Two futures exist. One in which you rescued Valstann Staghelm from death and brought him back to the present. Another in which you did not. You will be judged by the Bronze Dragonflight, with the aid of this oracle. You are familiar with the operation of a prism, that which bends light into its component colors? She is a prism in reverse, but for time. She is an overlapping image of all the possible time-streams which could have come about from your actions. As we have no measurement for what is 'better' or 'worse' in the lives of mortals except another mortal, the oracle's decisions will weigh heavily in our judgement."

---

The world-that-was arises as a vision, superimposing itself over the Caverns of Time. Ezra and his draconic hosts watch as events transpire.

The past Ezra is speaking to Remulos in Moonglade. "Musst we expose the rootss ourselvess for him to believe?"

"You had best leave that to Tyrande and myself... Forsaken," Remulos says, nodding pointedly to Ezra. "This must be handled amongst the kaldorei. You have helped all you can, I fear." A ghost of a smile flickers on the Keeper's face. "Unless you can imagine someone Staghelm will listen to."

Nearby, Saeren thinks for a moment, but says nothing. A look of melancholy is graven into her features.

Ezra stands silently, head down, eyes hidden behind the brim of his hat. Finally he speaks. "He musst lissten to the collective wissdom of hiss own people. A leader who dissregardss those around him iss not fit to lead, yes."

"I fear the archdruid has kept his own counsel for far too long to listen readily," Remulos remarks. He paces briefly, his hooves clacking on the stone of the path before sinking into the verdant soil of Moonglade. "Nevertheless, we the collected druids of Moonglade, and the priestesses of Elune, will do what must be done."

"That is all that I can assk," adds Ezra. And with that, the party takes its leave of the elves.

---

Ezra would be panting heavily if he still breathed. "We escaped, but barely," remarks Saeren behind him. Nerai's steam armor follows, carrying the unconscious Kagarn over its metal shoulder.

"Sylvanas Windrunner.. the Dark Lady.. is dead," the wizard mutters to himself. "I failed... and Daniel Batess still runss free. Thiss cannot be borne." He slams a bandaged fist into the rotting stone of the city's walls. "I had hoped she could sspeak to the consspiratorss.. convince them ssomehow.. our plans for the Monastery were sso close to the same thing."

Turning, he faces his companions. "I cannot go further with you. Ssecuring Lordaeron iss vital. It hass become clear that the naga have greater influence than I'd thought. Thiss musst mean that the blood elvess are at risk - or perhapss a rissk. The Horde musst be told about thiss matter, before the Apothecaries' rebellion loses uss our treaty."

He smiles, staring from face to face. "Each of you hass great potential. My friendss, go ssouth to Ironforge, and further to Sstormwind. Continue to warn the easstern kingdomss. I will rejoin you when I may." He withdraws an item from his pocket and presents it. It looks like a compass, but isn't pointing north. "A sseeker-compass, yess, which homess on the Defiant."

---

Grom'gol's forces are bloodied but unbowed, and the Altar of Naias has been taken. To the south, Booty Bay is still under the shadow of the chalice. Saeren has killed or converted more than a thousand naga in three fierce days of fighting. Her new war-wave is a miracle. She stares at it, glancing up abruptly as Kagarn enters her tent at the edge of Grom'gol.

"Still no news of Ezra?" the archer asks. Kagarn shakes his head. "He is still fighting, on behalf of his people. That is the last message. But I am afraid that everything north of Alterac may become naga territory soon."

"Get out here!" shouts one of the orcs' sentries, sounding distinctly panicked. The adventurers bolt, quickly looking this way and that to see what could have raised such an alarm. It does not take long.

From the sea, a mass of purple-blue tentacles are arising. They grab hold of the wooden walls of Grom'gol, and with a hellish noise reduce the planks to splinters. Gaps in the walls are being torn out even as the camp's defenders struggle to rally themselves. Many are weary, and not a few are still injured.

"Let the unbelievers drown in water!" calls a voice. Saeren looks up. Its accent is that of Darnassus, though its source could not possibly be elven.

Standing astride an enormous octopoid creature, a kraken of the uttermost deeps, is what might be a night elf - were it not for the writhing tentacles growing out of its back, the gills on its neck, and the watery blue-blackness of its eyes. "Destroy the Horde! Drown them all!"

Murlocs pour from the waters, only to be struck down by the Horde's finest archers. But they rise again, and again, as more of the monstrous elves emerge from the waves behind them. These raise their hands - or flippers, or fins, for some are showing a tendency toward transformation - and cast spells of healing and protection on their shock troops. Arrows bounce cleanly away; wounds are closed.

"Put those that live to the chalice!" commands the elf astride the kraken. "Do not fail me!"

---

Fandral Staghelm has not lain idle. The Ban'ethil Barrow Den once played host to hundreds of sleeping druids. Some drowned, as the archdruid flooded the dens with corrupted seawater, funneled through Teldrassil's own trunk. Many more emerged from the sudden lake having become something entirely new.

Now he strikes at seemingly unrelated ports of call around the world, sending his druids of the deeps astride sea-monsters of sailors' myth. The naga are only too happy to welcome the corrupted night elves into the fold.

From Grom'gol, Stonard then falls. From the beaches adjoining the Swamp of Sorrows, naga and murlocs and corrupted elves pour in a sickening wave of corruption. Stranglethorn Vale is cut off.

On Kalimdor, the chalice comes to Theramore and Auberdine. Durotar is beseiged on two coastlines - the river and the sea. The corruption of the Emerald Dream even reaches its horrid hand to Thunder Bluff itself.

Druids now take the form of sharks and squids, rather than the graceful cats and fearsome bears of their former calling. They, even better than the naga, are able to command the creatures of the deep - despite Dagun's mastery of all things aquatic, a druid's connection to the natural world and its denizens is second to none.

> (OOC) TidesGM has connected.

The druids of the deeps can emerge from seemingly any water supply - even puddles in the darkened alleyways of Stormwind, or the swift-flowing rivers around Redridge and Westfall.

On the eve of the coronation of Lady Traatha of the Naga as Queen of Stormwind, a lone night elf hides among the rafters of the chapel. Her aim is swift, her arm strong, and the naga witch dies uttering the name of her killer: "Saeren Finblighter!"

The cunning and resourceful elf is not quite capable of escaping the city, though. And when her companions back at camp see her emerge into the firelight, they do not expect arrows through their throats. They did not predict that Saeren would be taken over, her last command to kill her adopted family. Salty tears run down the night elf's cheek, and the final sliver of freedom the naga allowed her takes its course. She slits her throat efficiently, ending a lifetime of hate interrupted by a brief interval of hope.

---

The world-that-will-be arises as a vision, superimposing itself over the Caverns of Time. Ezra and the dragons watch it unfold.

Valstann Staghelm and his allies - Tyrande Whisperwind, Jeddek Ironhorn, Remulos and the druids of Moonglade - have gathered together to talk strategy.

Remulos is speaking. "It is clear to me now that this 'Sacred Fire' rumored to be spreading among the Horde is no accident, any more than the Emerald Dream's corruption is a coincidence. Nor that Teldrassil's raising was timed with Dagun's re-emergence." His measured tones lend a feeling of confidence.

"What do you mean?" asks young Valstann.

"The power of corrupted water arises in the world, Valstann," the Keeper explains. "The eternal balance of the elements demands, then, that a great power rise to match it. The power of purifying fire. The members of the Horde are becoming its vessel, just as the paladins of the Silver Hand became the vessel of their Light when a great darkness spread over the eastern kingdoms. The elements of nature will find harmony, after all."

---

"The Catalyst Storm is ready," announces a druid. Valstann stands ready. Druids flank him, and the shamans of the Earthen Ring stand present as well. The Covenant of the Grail has sent its best soldiers and sages to make this effort a reality.

"Very well," Valstann calls out. "Open the portal to the Emerald Dream!" And as the combined forces of tauren and night elf work their magics, the commander turns his attention to the Earthen Ring. "Begin the storm. Where is that girl?"

Sookie stands forth, holding up her arms. Every inch of bare skin has been tattooed - a magical representation of the Aggramar Catalyst. "Storm come. I fight through. No fear."

Valstann grins. "Good. We're counting on all of you."

The portal blossoms to life. Overhead, an enormous cloud has taken shape. But it's no ordinary creation of the weather. It has been imbued with the same power, the catalyst which transforms the corrupted energies of Dagun. "Behold the power of pure water!" calls Tidemist, the elemental. The storm moves toward the portal. Sookie walks at the center of it, followed closely by Valstann and his forces.

Travel through the Emerald Dream was once a duty reserved for the druids of the world. Now things have had to become more lenient. As the power of the corrupted Old God assails the strike force on every side, the Storm's purifying influence drives it back. Monsters leap out from the left and the right, materializing from the flux of the Dream, and Sookie disperses them with flashes of lightning.

"The far end! It's open, good! Forward!" Valstann surges ahead, followed by his loyal troops. The familiar surroundings of Teldrassil replace the warped green of the Dream. And here, too, is a familiar face. Valstann steps forward. "Father..."

---

Brann Bronzebeard is a hard dwarf to pin down. But today it's the other way around - he's desperately in search of one man. A tight knot of Forsaken gathered in the halls of Stormwind Keep attract his notice. "You lot!" he shouts. "Where is Ezra Pyreborn?"

One of the Forsaken erupts into a cloud of sand, and from it, Ezra's familiar shape - black coat and hat, bandages, and sardonic smile - emerges. "What iss it, sir?"

"We have to move up the invasion plans, lad. Our studies of the Titan Ruins - och, we've made a terrible blunder, we have!" Brann holds his head in his hands. "Listen, Nazjatar - near it, there's another installation, we have to--"

---

The visions fade abruptly. Ezra blinks, making sure his sight is working by focusing on Shayedormi and Letodormu. And on Leyara, or the oracle wearing her face.

"Well... that wass... interessting, yess," the wizard manages. The atmosphere is such that he feels uncomfortable expanding on this description, and he waits.

The two dragon advocates now turn to Leyara. Letodormu speaks first.

"In the world-that-was, Leyara, what of the mortal races? And what of those you knew?"

Leyara - the oracle, rather - speaks. "My husband Valstann was long mourned, longest by his father. In his rage, pain and grief, Fandral Staghelm embraced the promise of Dagun to restore his son. In the eternal waters of night, it was promised, Valstann could live again. Fandral believed this. He drowned the other druids on Teldrassil in the corrupted waters of the sea, and those druids turned other druids. I was among them."

"We became masters of the surface world. In the end, Teldrassil - a weapon vital to weakening Dagun - was mastered by the naga. Dagun's promise was only a shadow. My husband was restored, but an illusion only, taken from the composite madness of his father and myself."

Shayedormi now addresses herself to the oracle. "In the world-that-will-be, Leyara, what of the mortal races? And what of those you knew?"

"With Valstann returned to him, Fandral's madness ended. It did not go quietly, but he regained himself. My husband was returned to me. And Teldrassil was used to mortally wound Dagun. It was not enough, but it was necessary."

"This one event seems to be a pivotal moment in the history of this war," Shayedormi observes quietly, looking at Letodormu. The aggressive dragon does not meet her gaze, but he does not counter the suggestion. Instead:

"It doesn't matter how good the outcome. There is still the fact that this change will unravel the timestream. Slowly, yes, but destruction is inevitable."

This gets Ezra's attention. "And why iss that, if I may assk?"

Letodormu stares down at the Forsaken. "A soul has gone missing. And not any - the soul of a great hero. It was to take its place in the lives of heroes for the next thousand years, traveling to its next live when its previous one ended. Now that soul has been taken away, spirited into the future by you and your friends."

"Without those heroes' lives, wizard, this whole world becomes undone." Letodormu scowls. "A fact you did not anticipate."

The wizard stands his ground. "Very well. If it iss a ssoul of a hero you need, I offer my own. I am not some simple jester! I am Ezra L. Pyreborn."

The two dragons stop, and stare at each other. Shayedormi is the first to speak. "It is not that simple, Ezra. The world-that-will-be depends on you as well. You will continue to be a crucial influence. We cannot simply take you away from that now."

"There is a way," muses Letodormu. "Let me complete the seal."

"But that will take away his power, his magic, almost everything that he is," protests Shayedormi. "How can he proceed when he's barely more than a spirit?"

Ezra is the one to answer this. "My witss, my lady. My inner fire will find a way. Do not underesstimate me."

"This will mean your death. No act of defiance can change your eventual doom," Shayedormi says quietly.

Ezra just grins. And the caverns fairly shake with his reply: "Lok'tar ogar!"
