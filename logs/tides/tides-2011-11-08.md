At the moment of the dragon's death, Kaliera heard... something. And then she realized what it was: the death-cry of the dragon's soul. She had never been so close to a being so powerful at its moment of death before, and that scream of rage and denial broke something inside her....

---

"She has the gift, Vanar. She should be trained in it."

"Trained? Homsin, you are mad. That gift twisted the Auchenai, driving them to their terrible deeds! It took my brother!"

"Indeed, Vanar, and what happened to Maladaar was terrible. But to ignore the gift is to deny her part of herself! You must allow her to be trained."

"NEVER!" The fist shook the table. "We will seal it away, we will send her to be trained with the Anchorites, and we will never speak of this again."

"It cannot be held forever, cousin. Your daughter's gift will rise again."

---

Held there, by the screaming of the Dragon's soul as it passes beyond, and then the souls of dying orcs racing by. The rune of the Naaru appear before her forehead, then glows brightly for a moment.

---

"An Anchorite. What brings you to Auchindoun, fool?"

She swallows, and fights down fear. "I have come to find the Exarch Maladaar." Hands damp on the staff, she looks at the draenei in the red armor. "And deliver a message to him. I have come in peace, and unarmed, to deliver this message and depart."

"I am Maladaar." His face, twisted in a sneer, regarded the girl - not quite a woman - with no respect at all. "Deliver the message, and perhaps you will depart... and perhap not."

"Your brother wishes you to know that there is still a place at the table for you, if you choose to give up your ways and return. That is the message." She bowed her head. "And I go."

"Wait. Who are you?"

"I am the Anchorite Kaliera... and your niece."

His lips pulled back completely, baring his teeth. "How... nice. Let me give you a message to take back."

She barely had time to react before his palm, crackling with black energies, touched her forehead. And then she knew nothing more.

---

They were angry, and afraid, and some of them ashamed, and a few simply accepted what was happening to them, as they began to pass through to that place beyond. They worried for those left behind; wondered about the fates of their mates and offspring.

---

"Is she....?"

"Kaliera lives, Vanar. She lives and breathes, but little more. Her mind seems... lost."

"What happened to her?"

"You asked a message to be sent to your brother. She was chosen to deliver it." The two men turned to see...

"Velen!"

The prophet-leader of the Draenei stepped past the priest and his brother to lay his hand on Kaliera's head. "Her mind wanders dark places... but is not lost. She knows the darknes and the Light." Wind chimes seemed to rise, and ribbons of white flowed to, and past, Velen into Kaliera, as the power of O'Ros joined with the Draenei prophet.

Kaliera's eyes closed.

"She will sleep, for a while. And she will awaken, healed. But the gift remains within her, and so does the knowledge that Maladaar, in his attempt to corrupt her, imbued in her. Her will is strong; she will not remember it until it is needed, and O'Ros..."

The chimes became words. **I will watch over her as needed.**

"Thank the Light," Vanar said, dropping to his knees. "Thank the Light, thank the Naaru, and thank Velen!"

"Her gift will rise again, Vanar. She will find herself with the power to speak to those that have passed. But she will not be of the Auchenai. She will be herself."

---

And now it all came together: the black knowledge of Maladaar, locked away; the teachings of O'Ros; the words of Velen and of her teacher Ishanah.

She was no longer Kaliera, the Anchorite.

She now was Kaliera, the Soulspeaker, as she was meant to be.

It was mere moments for her world to change and yet be the same, and she took her first breath as the first Soulspeaker.

And just like that she gathered the power around her. There were things to be done.

She did not yet realize that two dark violet lines came down from her hairline to the outer corner of her eyes.
