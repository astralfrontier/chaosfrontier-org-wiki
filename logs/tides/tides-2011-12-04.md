# Turning Tides 2011-12-04

> (OOC) Log "Tides-2011-12-04" started by Sookie at Sun Dec 4 17:44:58 2011 CST (OOC)

The adventuring party hustles its way out of the Black Rock orcs' cave, with two surviving orc captives to show for their trouble. Interrogation at Redridge is the next logical step.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "more coming here:"

The road back to Lakeshire is nearly empty. The party catches sight of a human huntsman in the distance, stalking prey. There are a pair of orc scouts hiding behind a distant rock outcropping, who hustle away the moment the group comes into view - too far even for bowshot, with the rocky cover they use.

> (OOC) Saeren returns from idle land to play ^^;;

Lakeshire is attained, and Solomon is contacted. With Troteman and his men watching carefully, the pair of orcs are unceremoniously dumped into a cell. "Thanks for your help," Troteman announces, after they're secure. "We'll alert you once we have actionable intelligence." It seems the group is at liberty.

Kaliera is still a little dazed, bleary, perhaps even delerious from the events in the cave; she spends part of the trip in a muttered one-sided conversation in Orcish with the air to her left.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "alright. you have a bit to wander around town. Kagarn will step in shortly. anything before then?"

Kaliera rubs her forehead. "I... feel somewhat unwell. I may need to lie down for a short while."

Saeren looks to Kaliera, "Are you going to be alright?" she asks, breaking her usual fit of silence.

Kaliera's eyes dart around. "I need to... center myself somewhat. The cave, the dragon... it seems to have caused some kind of event. Within me, I mean."

> (OOC) TidesGM has connected.

Kagarn, looking concerned, speaks up. "There is a malaise creeping into this region, emanating from the north," he announces. "The dragon's presence may be carrying it. If the Black Rock orcs are indeed drinking demon's blood, as were the Horde of old, it may have a component of spiritual contamination. Rest for now, while I ascertain its nature. A cleansing may be in order."

Kaliera composes herself a bit, and bows. "I will be aboard in my quarters should you require me."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "unless Saeren has somethin, we'll skip ahead a bit"

> (OOC) Sookie skips ahead then :)

A day passes. Lady Lainsborough invites Kagarn, Kaliera and Saeren to visit her again for elevenses. Sookie is once again serving as a maid, though she lacks the eloquence she possessed before. The lady seems to be training her with a combination of coffee and stick. If she doesn't properly serve coffee, she's lightly cuffed with a stick the lady uses to support herself.

Kaliera still seems distracted by something - seeing things no one else can, almost - but is able to at least come out of her quarters.

After Kagarn has explained his theory over coffee, the lady considers it for a time. "It's possible," she admits. "And what do you propose to do about it?" Kagarn gestures to his companions: "I intend to roam the valley until I confirm the presence of such energies, and then I will cleanse them in the tradition of the Earthen Ring."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "open pose if you got somethin"

"And if that doesn't work, we can always cleanse them using the techniques of other traditions," adds Saeren. Like overwhelming firepower.

Sookie speaks up. "Na, goshi--" **cuff** "Hey, I just say--" **cuff** "Excuse me, master, but.. you need help? Orc might attack." **cuff** "I mean, the orcs might attack you." Sookie scowls at her mentor, but the lady quietly drinks her coffee without speaking.

Kagarn nods. "If the Lady will deign to er, release you from your service today, we would welcome the help."

Kaliera pauses for a moment as she seems to be reaching down to something about a foot above the floor, closing her eyes and shaking her head, and then straightening up again.

Saeren covers a grin with a drink that takes some time to fully enjoy. Kaliera's odd behavior wipes the smirk away, "Kaliera? You still feeling strange?"

Kaliera says, "I... thought I saw a cat."

The Lady's eyes narrow slightly. "That cleansing. You had better get going."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "ready?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Yup"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Let's doooo this ^^"

Not far from a reputed murloc village, Kagarn has set out the tools of his trade. Totems, incense, bones, certain herbal concoctions, retorts, mixing bowls, and other paraphernelia of the shaman's trade lie on a decorative tauren-made blanket. The shaggy shaman is deep in his trance. His objective: conjure up the spirits of Lakeshire's lake, invoking water's purifying energies.

Kagarn's fingers twist together in lazy patterns. Eyes shut, he seems to 'see' something which his hands reach out to manipulate - but for a time, those with him see only empty air and the stillness of the lake, broken only by the mist-shrouded far shore.

Kaliera looks around, as people - but thin, gossamer ones - appear to her, moving towards Kagarn, but stop forming a semicircle a respectful distance away. Some are human, some orcish, even a pair of murlocs, but all seem placid, here to observe not to interfere.

"The falls, pouring, the river, running, the lake, holding," he recites in a dreamy sing-song. "Fall, run, stop, sit.. distant neighbors, singing futilely in the rain..." And the burly tauren's eyes open. "The river spirit is here," he announces. "It has a request."

Kaliera turns to Kagarn. "What does the spirit wish?" She cannot see what he can, hear what he hears.

"Bodies.. many bodies. They have fallen into the lakes," Kagarn says. He's not replying so much as relaying, and the others can see him strain to catch the message. "Bodies.. the lake will surface them for us, but we must remove them and honor them as they deserve. And something must be done about their spirits too. So much fighting.."

Kaliera says, "I think... that will fall to me and what has happened to me. Some of their spirits are here already; as their bodies come forth others may come."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Kaliera, go ahead and proceed here."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "bodies need funerary rights according to their custom. it won't be pretty"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "And in the case of orcs, is going to need a /lot/ of fire."

Kaliera reaches into her bag and pulls out the book they've seen before. "We will need to dig graves for the humans, and build a number of pyres for the orcs," she says, leafing through it. "And I have no information on the rites for murlocs." She has some ideas, but, uh, her cooking skills and personal beliefs do not allow THAT. "If the honored spirit can bring them forth, we can begin to make preparations once we have a count."

"I work on graves," Sookie mumbles. "I dig fast."

"I will work on the pyres, if that is alright with everyone else. I have a friend who can haul a lot of wood," says Saeren.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "bodies can be retrieved with TK, arrows with trailing rope lines, or wading."

Kaliera says, "All right then. We will sort them out, perform funary rites, bury or burn as needed, and then..." She pauses, looking to the right, then nods. "...and the murloc corpses placed in a single grave and covered."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "you guys can both pose to completion"

Kaliera uses magic on her grisly task. Some of the corpses are skeletonized now, others merely fish-eaten and waterlogged. It is grim work to sort them out, human and orc and murloc. Disturbingly, sometimes she seems to be talking to a corpse, or just above it.

Saeren's work is all about sweat and muscle. It fits those she would put to rest perfectly. Trees are cut down and further chopped for the pyres, Shade's considerable strength is put to the test hauling logs. When all is ready, three pyres stand ready, each more than large enough for a few bodies, with kindling to spare.

> (OOC) Saeren isn't sure if it's time to pose the burning just yet :)

Kaliera arranges bodies: humans in their individual graves, orcs on pyres, the murlocs in their own single grave. She performs a brief ceremony at each of the graves, then one more at the mass grave. She quietly indicates that Sookie should start to fill them in.

Kaliera watches the human spirits she'd seen before move to graves, and get in, lying down as if going to sleep, spirits at rest at last. One of them, an older man in military garb, salutes her just before climbing down. The orcs gather around the pyres, waiting; the murlocs fade away into nothingness.

> (OOC) Sookie throws something in.

The priest watches the procession. So many people have died here. A pair of spectral children skip past, sometimes breaking into laughter and chasing one another. A mother carrying her infant. Two battle-hardened orcs, clasping hands in brotherhood as they wait for their final release. A man with ashen hair and haunted eyes, dragging a phantasmal sword behind him which looks to weigh hundreds of pounds from his exertions. A woman wearing a cowled robe, who stops and looks straight at Kaliera for a moment, intensely red eyesockets where her eyes ought to be.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "light the fires and fill the holes. we're done here."

Sookie does her part to re-cover the graves. She doesn't seem bothered by the corpses; perhaps it's a strong character. Perhaps it's far too much casual exposure to the dead.

> (OOC) Saeren Fixes an RL mess and poses n.n

Kaliera moves to the pyres, raising hands and calling fire from the sky, burning essence of the Light setting the pyres off as she cries out in Orcish. To her ears, she hears the cry returned from the spirits of the orcs, as they go to their bodies. Two of them remain behind for a moment, one older than the other. "Thank you for this, priestess," he says to her. "My son and I go to our ancestors now, but someday you will have need of us, and should you call on us, we will come." "Hey," comes a voice from a grave, as the man who saluted her stands up. "That's for me too! Can't have an orc showing more honor than me!" The two exchange grins - death changes many things.

Saeren watches the orc pyres solemnly, waiting until the flames hit their peak to slam a sharp salute, her voice rising harshly as she cries, "Lok'tar ogar!"

Kaliera smiles, and looks to Saeren. "Those who have not passed on return your salute."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "finish out whatever you guys have here, and we'll move on. :)"

Kaliera closes her eyes, then opens them again. Then sighs, and starts to collect the remaining bones. "One more grave, Sookie. For the horse." She says this with a combination of amusement and a faintly put-upon air. The spectral horse, for itself, nickers quietly.

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "and with that, I think we're good. :)"

Sookie obeys. And as the group gather again around Kagarn, the tauren's spirit-touched sing-song voice is heard again. "Child of the storm, you struggle against earth. Shall I teach you my secret? My gratitude extends beyond this, but more corruption awaits in Stonewatch Keep, and my waters do not reach high enough to wash it away. I must use you."

> (OOC) Saeren has to afk for a bit to eat.. will be back shortly.. :/

Sookie nods. "Yes. Teach secret. We fight orcs." And the river, through Kagarn, replies. "This is the secret of the washing away of rock and stone. Your word for it is erosion. I do it all the time, but slowly, so as not to provoke the spirits of rock. But it can be done faster. Will you accept this secret?" Sookie nods. And so the river teaches her the trick of washing away rock and stone.

It is a simple one, easy to describe. And at the end of it, Sookie smiles. "Thank you, water spirit. We go fight orc. We remember you to people in village that have your name."

---

> (OOC) Sookie says, "alright. while sumi's away, if Kaliera has anything else let's get it done. once she's back we'll pick up the other thing, which involves both of you"

Kaliera sits on the ground as the shaman and the elemental-kin speak to the spirit, meditating and regaining strength. Now, she feels, she is getting a grip on these gifts.

> (OOC) Kaliera just has that.

Kagarn approaches, fresh (and still pungent) from his channeling. "How are you feeling?" he asks.

Kaliera says, "Strange." She either cannot smell it, or diplomatically doesn't notice it. "The sight, the sudden knowledge, was... disturbing. But it is becoming easier, more natural."

"A shamanic awakening is often traumatic," rumbles the big bull. "Whatever insight you are the recipient for is one foreign to my experience. Among my people, the tradition of the shaman allows us to share our revelations with the younger generation, and to learn from the elders, forming a continuous thread of comprehension. I greatly fear that whatever has come over you is not due to this landscape alone, but to some element of the draenic experience which is foreign to me. I .. regret that I cannot assist you through it, nor do I know who could."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm back :)"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "k :)"

Kaliera says, "It is a gift not unknown amongst my people, but... most of those who have it are considered dangerous, and the gift itself considered as malign. I must struggle with it. I may need to find a way to return to the Exodar and speak to those of my order for more knowledge. Still, the fact that this is not unheard of, the struggle, makes me feel better about it. I will move through it and be stronger."

Kagarn rumbles, but does not reply for a moment. "Very well. The opportunity may present itself soon. I fear matters in Darnassus will not be stable for much longer." He glances over, spotting Saren watching Sookie mock-wrestling with Shade. "There is another cleansing ritual to perform. Are you ready?"

Kaliera says, "I am ready. This is your expertise; tell me what you require and I shall follow."

Kagarn leads the group away from the grave-site to more wholesome surroundings. There he once again lays out the tools of his particular trade. "The beasts of the region have been disturbed," the shaman explains. "The wildlife has not been shown the proper veneration, something I would expect from orcs of the corrupted old Horde. Sadly, the humans seem not to care either. We must do this for them." He gestures at Saeren's big cat. "Shade will assist us here. He is the most natural being of all of us, most in tune with the currents of the living world. He will perform the hunt... fortunately for me." He points with a thick furred finger at a collection of spices and herbs. "Kaliera, you will begin a stew. The meat will come to you; Shade will bring it. Saeren, direct Shade in the hunting of various beasts to be found here. Find them, and let the nightsaber kill and bring them here. I will do the rest."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "alright. You guys are on a sacred hunt-slash-cookout here. Bring meat, make stew."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Have cat, will butcher."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "garage repairman will be comin by after 30 minutes or so"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So let's see.. what animals might we find.. obviously dear.."

Kaliera gets water from the lake, ritually thanking the spirit of the lake for the use of the water, and fills a pot, adding the herbs and spices as needed to make the broth.

Saeren nods in understanding and turns to Shade for a moment. "Well friend, this is a task I think you shall enjoy almost as much as swimming." The night elf and her companion melt away from the group's sight, almost spectral in their stealth. The first target to be brought down is a great stag. The power of Shade is simply too much for such a beast to contend with, the knifelike fangs bringing the hunt to an end. The creature is dragged back by Shade and left with Kaliera, and once again the hunt resumes.

This time, the target is a different one, a beast not prone to being the target of a hunt. Shade stalks a mountain lion, and unlike the last hunt it ends in a terrible clash of claws. Still, the nightsaber has gone far, and faced many trials that few other creatures can boast. Once more the pile is increased with a fresh kill.

> (OOC) Saeren has one more kind of montage pose ^^

> (OOC) Sookie says, "whatever you guys feel appropriate is what you do here :)"

The hunt grows faster, the animals drawn from all those in the area. A fox, a half a dozen rabbits, several squirrels, a small bear, and more. Shade's enthusiasm for the task is clear, and in only a few hours the cat has drawn back over a score of carcasses for the cooking.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I think that should be enough ^^"

Kaliera uses a simple spell to butcher the creatures, then uses both meat and the heart of the animals in the stew, speaking to their ghosts as she does so to reassure them this was not simply killing, but their lives ended to help cleanse the land. The stag accepts this; the mountain lion is not particularly pleased; the bear is confused, and the rabbits and squirrels appear to have accepted that they're prey and this is what happens to them.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Alright. In broad terms, there's been a lot of senseless sacrifice and death in this part of the world (on all sides), and you guys are taking a hand in righting that. So, eat up and thank the valley's spirits in your prayers."

> (OOC) Sookie is going to transfer downstairs, repairman should be here soon. GM can also kick in if he thinks anything should happen here :)

> (OOC) Sookie says, "This sort of thing is the day to day work of a shaman in the field. In cultures with well-run shamanic traditions, this situation wouldn't have happened. On the other hand, the humans probably don't /care/ that it was in a bad way, because humans put up towers and keeps and fortresses to warn them when something's wrong, whereas the tauren listen to the animal spirits and ancestors who are telling them when there's trouble."

Saeren and Shade have cleansed themselves in the waters and return to eat Kaliera's cooking. With each taste, Saeren recites a prayer of thanks that she recalls hearing as a child, a tradition that was not careless nor thoughtless among the elves. Kaliera's stew tasting great makes it easy for her to feel intense gratitude with every mouthful. As for Shade, the cat eats as it always does, which is itself a balanced, right way with the world. The top predators may not like to be sacrificed, but they live by the law of nature, and the strongest have the right to survive and thrive.

Kaliera watches the animal ghosts disappear into the world.

Kaliera says, "I think we are prepared."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "we're gonna wrap for now, so here goes :)"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sounds good ^^"

Gradually, the adventurers can feel a lightening. Of themselves, of the atmosphere. And this sharpening of the spiritual sense allows them to feel a new sensation. Whereas the whole valley once felt a subtle oppression, now the source feels clear even to those without a sense of spirits or magic: Stonewatch Keep.
