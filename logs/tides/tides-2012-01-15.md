Having seen their black dragon champion defeated and put to flight before their eyes, the captured orcs are in little mood to resist interrogation. Troteman quickly obtains some crucial intelligence; he hardly even needs to threaten them openly.

A few days ago - shortly before the Audacious set down at Lakeshire - Messner was deliberately allowed to escape, and Corporal Keeshan and the rest of his men were taken to Stonewatch Keep. The original plan had been to draw Lakeshire's defenders out, where a black dragon would easily dispatch them; the only flaw was that the true leaders of the Blackrock clan had sorely underestimated their opposition.

The orcs are able to supply some of the details of the Stonewatch defenders' routine - though no one, including Troteman, believes that routine will stay exactly the same now. They also convey that the cellar-dungeons beneath Stonewatch have been kept in proper repair, and that human prisoners have been held there before - although seldom for very long. The Blackrocks are not known for offering prisoner exchanges.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Feel free to ask any other relevant questions. These guys are singing like canaries."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "go ahead, let me know if/when you are done :)"

> (OOC) Saeren kicks RL ><

The orcs don't know for sure if there are any other black dragons in residence at Stonewatch, besides the victim of the Covenant's might. The warlord Gath'llzogg and his lieutenant Tharil'zun are both almost certainly orcs, but there are always political officers sent from Blackrock, and the orcs have their suspicions about them. Certainly the dragon at Render's caves had been among them.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "That's pretty much all I can think of that is of interest to you guys."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I don't really have anything to ask. I was interested in the dragon question, which was addressed."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Guess it's time for us to draw and quarter them n.n"

Sookie doesn't have much in the way of battle intelligence to gather. She only has one question for the pair. "Why you follow dragon?" she asks bluntly, in orcish.

One of them snorts with mingled fear and contempt. "Why do you think? What were we gonna do, say no?" The other, and the slightly more intelligent of the two, shakes his head. "They promised us greatness, if you must know. Revenge on you and your kind," he adds with a wry, fanged grin. "But like my friend here says, they also made it pretty clear what'd happen if we didn't."

"I raised by orc woman," Sookie retorts. "What that make me?" She slides up the (admittedly small) sleeve of her leather battle-dress, and flexes her (admittedly small) bicep. "I stronger than dragon. Power of storm beat them. Elemental power beat all. You want be strong? Be brave? I got challenge for you."

The two look at each other, doubtfully, then shrug. The smarter one says, "We're listenin'."

Sookie jerks a thumb back at Kagarn. "You learn about elements, about spirits. Undead wizard we know say everyone have power inside them. So we find yours. Be apprentice to goshi. We find your power too. When you done, you say no to dragon, no fear. I promise. Goshi not human, you no need revenge against him."

The first one looks at Kagarn with open contempt. "Spirits? What kind of nonsense is-" he begins, only to be shouted down by his companion. "Shut up, Garn! Don't you remember, back on Draenor? Don't you remember the shamans? They used to talk to the elements alla time, before they all decided to talk to demons instead." He looks at Sookie, and Kagarn. "I dunno about this moron here, but I been fightin' this war a long time. We tried demons, we tried dragons. Can't hurt to give spirits another try."

Garn snorts contemptuously. "What, like the fake Horde? Bunch of soft, weak-hearted-" "You ain't fought the 'fake' Horde, have ya, Garn? Try fightin' them sometime, then tell me about weak." He grabs Garn by the collar and pulls him close. "Or maybe you'd like to try callin' _me_ weak?" Garn looks wide-eyed at the other, and rapidly shakes his head.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "One more."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sookie is recruiting :D"

Kagarn comes up to the bars and looks between them, first at Garn, then at his friend. Also in Orcish, he speaks: "It is difficult to make an apprentice of someone who does not wish it. You respect strength, though. Sookie here has shown you what strength there is in the elements. And there _is_ similar strength in you, I deem. It is cowed by fear, but I can teach you not to fear."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone else?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Troteman."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "what's he gonna do about this?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "He only demands you not let them loose anywhere near Lakeshire. If you take them away with you on the Audacious, they're no longer his problem."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "that's the plan! alright."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "We can abstract away most of this. The only thing is that Garn will require a little further schooling before he'll accept Kagarn as his mentor, and Kagarn can and will easily school him."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "rock on. good to go"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I suppose I can't beat them up n.n"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I can cover those details in a few quick poses."

Troteman has been watching the exchange with grave skepticism. "May I have a word, Kagarn?" he says, and the two confer in the corner. It doesn't take long to deal with the colonel's objections, though. His charge is to defend the town of Lakeshire, and if the Covenant agrees to take responsibility for the prisoners, and to not release them anywhere near Lakeshire, then the orcs are no longer his problem.

For his part, the Blackrock orc known as Garn is not yet convinced. A simple if bloody-minded individual, he puts little stock in words. Fortunately, a practice chamber of the Audacious is easily converted into a dueling arena. A half hour later, a bloodied but unbowed Kagarn emerges from the hall, supporting Garn with a hand wrapped firmly round his shoulders. With uncharacteristic brevity, Kagarn says, "Garn has agreed to accept his apprenticeship to me. Isn't that so?" Garn only groans.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "We'll make a Gorok Stoneskull of him yet!"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "that's right"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All right! Now that that's settled, any further business?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "nothing plot-advancing :)"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "our next step basically involves Geoff"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Yeah. And I think he's nappin before raid tonight."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Well, in any case..."

---

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "We pretty much do need Kaliera for the assault on Stonewatch. And I need her in particular for that, plot-wise, 'cause there's a dead man I need her to meet."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "About the only thing I could possibly think to do with just Saeren and Sookie is have a certain messenger from Stonard show up as an advance party. I'd originally planned for that to come after Stonewatch, of course."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "it can wait."

> (OOC) TidesGM nods. "Anything you have been waiting to do, Saeren?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "but... actually, this is a good time for it. now that I think about it"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Yeah, I think it does make a pretty good time for it. It's kind of a shame that Geoff would miss it, but then his character didn't know Ezra as long as Saeren and Kagarn have."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sorry, returning from an afk there."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "As for me... I don't have much on my mind here. :)"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I still need to finalize some stuff with Shade, but that's not really a big thing."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All right. Sookie, do you know how you want to start this off?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "sure."

The two orc captives aren't the last of Troteman's problems. While the adventurers and their Lakeshire allies are planning out an assault on Stonewatch Keep, messengers come in. A group of orcs have been spotted on the Redridge Highway. Their campfires burn at night, with no attempt to conceal them, and by day the scouts' spyglasses reveal the heraldry of the Horde - and the Covenant. "Probably coming from Stonard," concludes Troteman, upon receiving this intelligence. "Are they with you lot?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "oops, one quick modification..."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "updated"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "smarter people than Sookie are welcome to speculate on this"

Kagarn nods. "It's quite likely," he says. "I know that Ezra had sent word to Stonard via magical messenger, and he knows that we were headed here very soon."

"If you would be so kind..." Troteman seems uncomfortable with orcs, even supposedly friendly ones. "Can you meet them on the other side of the lake?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "assuming that happens...."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "POsing in fast."

Saeren laughs a little at Troteman's discomfort, "It will be as you say. It has been a time since I've practiced their tongue, in any case."

> (OOC) TidesGM poses in as well.

Kagarn nods. "I encourage you to attend as well, though, or send someone in your stead," he advises. "If they have come here, they may wish to coordinate on dealing with the naga. The sea is not so far from here."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "okay. headin out?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Yup. Troteman won't go, but he'll send a lieutenant to listen."

> (OOC) Kaliera has connected.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "alright:"

One of Troteman's men eventually accompanies the adventurers out across the bridge. The Stonard expedition's own scouts haven't been any less cautious; they won't cross into armed Alliance territory without good reason. They are waiting on a hilltop some distance away, signal fires burning. Their leader is a female orc with an eyepatch, and two axes slung at her sides. Her Common is barely adequate. "Peace. We come as the Covenant."

Kagarn bows. "The Covenant greets you," he replies. "What is your business here?"

The warrior woman clears her throat, glancing about her. "Wizard come. Undead. Tell a tale of naga, of warriors of all clans. I guess this mean you. He say he just copy, and that swamp come under attack soon. That maybe traitor naga will help, or humans. Spreading words, standing together. Brave talk."

"It is good you have come," says Saeren. She speaks in a slow, steady common, ensuring understanding. "You have spoken to Ezra?"

The orc nods. "He say that his name. He disappear as we cross mountains. Just vanish before our sight. Very surprised look on his face. We keep going, though."

The tauren shaman suddenly looks grave. "Ezra's copy disappeared?" he asks, and closes his eyes. "I am sorry to hear that."

The orc leader doesn't seem so concerned. "Wizardry is mystery. Who speak for Lakeshire here?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "GM, however the stonard guys & Lakeshire guys work out is up to you"

Troteman's lieutenant speaks up. "I speak for Lakeshire," he says, in orcish only slightly less broken than the Stonard emissary's Common. "Please speak in your native tongue if it is easier. I can understand better than I speak, and I suspect it is the same for you with Common."

The two converse for a time, and it soon becomes clear that the Blackrock orcs are the sticking point, from Lakeshire's perspective. That renegade clan is the only contact most Lakeshire residents have had with Draenor's natives in many years, and few in Lakeshire find it easy to distinguish between them and Thrall's Horde. From the lieutenant's heated words, it seems that he has trouble with that distinction himself.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone wish to comment on this?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Perhaps some intervention?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "How do you mean?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Posing is what I mean. Gonna talk."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Go for it!"

Saeren notices the problems and steps forward, speaking in a broken orcish, "Taking too long." She draws out her weapon, its shaping flashing into that of a sword. She slashes into the ground two vertical marks, saying, "Horde. Alliance." She looks at the emissaries, "Separated, some strength." She draws a far deeper, uglier rut in the earth, shaping a crude wave. "The enemy.. far stronger. Horde and Alliance on their own. No chance." She slashes through the two marks. "Another way." This time she slashes twice more, the two lines meeting in the point of a triangle. "Together, stronger by far. The wave will not crush us." Her eyes meet with those of the orc and the human, the night elf's gaze harsh. "If you live in the past. All who follow you die." She raises her weapon menacingly, "I will not let that happen to your people. No matter the cost."

> (OOC) Saeren poses broken orcish. Woot.

> (OOC) Sookie gives Saeren a complimentary membership in the No Speek Gud Club. She is the president.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Yay! Huh, the badge seems to be blank.. guess we don't write, either n.n"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Half tempted to have Lady Lainsborough showing up holding a switch, and /everyone/ runs for the hills. c.c"

> (OOC) Sookie cowers instinctively

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I think I already did what she would n.n"

> (OOC) Kaliera should show up, slightly late, at this point x.x

> (OOC) Saeren says, "If you two don't stop fighting I'm going to kill you both! Saeren's diplomacy. n.n"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Kaliera can be considered to have been here all along. Feel free to contribute what you can."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Until then:"

The orcish emissary considers the diagram carefully. "The elf is right," she says at last. "But I must also agree with you," she adds, nodding toward the lieutenant. "You humans have more than enough cause to distrust orcs. You will need a sign." She looks to the northeast, frowning in intense concentration. "And the Blackrock orcs have been a thorn in _our_ side as well. For too long."

Kaliera speaks in Orcish, "I apologize for this, but... what is your name? It is not terribly honorable for us to keep saying 'you' to speak to you."

The orcish woman straightens up. In Orcish: "I am Risa Twinblade, daughter of Gom the Blacksmith. I have slain the black dragonkin of the swamp and the feral trolls who haunt the lake. I stood against the demons of the Tainted Scar and etched my axes in their acidic blood. I have gone to war. I now come in peace. I will uphold the honor of the Horde against the pretenders in the humans' keep."

Saeren nods to the orc, "Perhaps you are right, and that may be just what is required to end this argument."

Kaliera nods. "I am Kaliera, soulspeaker, daughter of those who have passed. I have faced trolls and naga in Stranglethorn, done battle in the caves against the pretenders of the Blackrock, and with my companions faced a drake. Though in the past our peoples have been at war, I trust in the honor of the orcs." Precisely which 'peoples' she leaves unspoken.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "phone"

Risa grins. Touching her eyepatch briefly, she nods to both elf and draenei. For the humans' benefit, she returns to Common. "I am born after come through Dark Portal. I am of Azeroth. I stand for Azeroth. We fight together."

> (OOC) Kaliera has reconnected.

Lieutenant Timmonds nods, and reaches out to shake hands with Risa. "I've studied the Third War. It seems our peoples can only work together if we have a common enemy." He grins wryly. "Fortunately for both of us, this world seems to be well stocked with common enemies."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "alright! we have some allies"

"It is time to destroy a few more of them," says Saeren. "And through this, we build something we never had before."

Risa returns the handshake and grins toothily in return. "I return to Stonard," she says, still in Common. "We send word to New Kargath. Blackrock orcs cannot fight in all places at once. And then we march from east. We come no closer than Stonewatch."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Kaliera, probably a good idea for you to give Risa one of your tokens."

Kaliera reaches out her hand, a small token in it. "With this we can speak at a distance. To plan, and insure no accidents happen."

Risa accepts the token gratefully. "Very important," she agrees, stepping back and giving a salute. "Lok'tar ogar!"

Kaliera returns the salute. "Lok'tar!"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "so did raid not happen, or are you just idle?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "PWD. Posting While Dead."

Timmons grins, and salutes in the human fashion. "Lok'tar!"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anything else?"

> (OOC) Sookie got nothin!

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Then I've got one last thing to wrap up"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "relatively small"

---

As they make their way back to Lakeshire, Kagarn still seems dour. "How much do any of you know of the ways of the arcane?" he asks.

"No taste good," pipes up Sookie.

Kaliera says, "My ways are more spiritual. I may be able to find some information, if you can give an idea as to what bothers you."

"None, but I worry that Ezra should vanish," says Saeren.

Kagarn grimaces. "That is precisely it, Saeren. The disappearance of Ezra's double worries me. I know little enough myself, but I do know that for such an image to persist, there must be a small part of his mind that is devoted to feeding it with its power. If it vanishes... it means that he could not, or would not, maintain it any longer."

"I will not lose hope in seeing Ezra again," replies Saeren. "I refuse to. Still, he would not have us abandon our course. More than our lives are at stake."

Kaliera says, "The honored Pyreborn has been through much, from what I have been told, and I am certain he will overcome what he is going through now."

Kagarn nods. "Ezra Pyreborn has devoted his life to the safety of Azeroth and of his people. If his devotion is finally complete, that does not end our obligation." He sighs deeply. "Still... if that is the case, I shall still miss him."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I just wanted to make sure that was established. anyone have anything else?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "One more brief one."

Sookie sighs too. "Thought goshi talk about food," she says glumly. "We go back, eat. Then take over fortress. Okay?"

> (OOC) Sookie had to. ^\_^

"Don't talk like that, Kagarn," says Saeren. "Sookie is right. Let's focus on what must be done. Ezra will return, and I am sure he will have quite the tale to tell. It is our task to ensure that we have a story to tell of our own."

Kagarn brightens slightly. "Indeed," he says, and grins. "Both him and we, I am sure, will have tales to tell of bearding dragons in their own dens - each in our own way."

> (OOC) Saeren slips in a last one ^^

Saeren nods sharply, but softly to herself murmurs, "And if he should not return, we will face the depths of the abyss to drag our friend back."
