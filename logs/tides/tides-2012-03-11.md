It might seem that a whole forest must be felled to satisfy the needs of the Undercity's scribes.

It began with a letter, hand-delivered to Sylvanas Windrunner on the dais where she holds court. The messenger came with signs and pass-words not to be ignored, and the Banshee Queen studied the missive with narrow glowing eyes. "Convene a meeting of the senior arcanists. In the Mage Quarter, one hour. Get Pierce Shackleton. Recall Anastasia Hartwell from Deathknell. And find Mortaim!"

The Dark Lady's orders are obeyed without hesitation. Messengers are dispatched. Runners are sent.

At the meeting, a pair of most unexpected visitors are presented. Their mission is to dictate the contents of a codex. For the next twelve hours, skilled arcanists come and go from the meeting. Only the most senior of the Forsaken's wielders of magic can even grasp the topics being presented, and only for so long can they simply take dictation without the need to question, verify and expand upon the information so presented.

And upon the final dispensation of data, the visitors have questions for their audience: what of the Covenant of the Chalice? What of its most active advocates? "Approaching the human city of Stormwind" is the word.

This news excites yet another wave of activity. Some of the knowledge of today's catechism must be put to immediate use. The wizards form themselves into a ritual circle, led by one of the newcomers. And great magic is worked.

---

Matters have calmed somewhat. Sylvanas now addresses herself to half a dozen Forsaken. All wear the simple leathers of travelers, armed to defend themselves, and all bear the tokens of the Covenant of the Chalice. Some are human, while others are undead: the Sacred Fire has taken hold in their souls, and they may walk as they wish.

Sylvanas walks from traveler to traveler, presenting each one with an envelope sealed with the dark mark of the Undercity. "You know your missions. You need not decide what to say to your hosts; that will be provided for you, of course. Simply deliver your messages, and take the responses you are given."

As the messengers depart, the elf regards Captain Bragor Bloodfist of the Kor'kron Guard. Since the fall of Varimathras, Thrall has felt the need to have a closer eye on events in Lordaeron. Bloodfist grunts, waiting for her to speak.

"This seems like madness," she observes. Bloodfist only grunts again; the queen crinkles her brow slightly, but continues. "The Alliance attacked us. And we are now to withdraw our forces? Retreat, and just.. wait? Still, I have been wrong before. We are more secure now through a similar act of insanity. I will give him this one chance. If he is wrong, things will be very difficult."

The orc is finally roused to speak. "This is Horde business now. The Warchief will understand. Your kind are ... improving. Thrall will support you."

Sylvanas smirks. "Comforting words from the Warchief's Watchdog. Still... I find myself hoping that this plan succeeds."
