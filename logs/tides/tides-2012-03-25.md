# Turning Tides 2012-03-25

> (OOC) Log "Tides-2012-03-25" started by TidesGM at Sun Mar 25 18:00:03 2012 CDT (OOC)

As the Audacious cruises over Elwynn Forest, it is intercepted by a flight of mounted gryphon riders. They bear a message: although the Covenant is welcome in Stormwind, their flying fortress is not. It will have to put down out of cannonshot of the city walls, perhaps near Northshire or Goldshire, and its inhabitants approach on foot or mount.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Any specific preparations you wish to make, or do you just park and lock and we move on?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "We'll do the usual, using our key fab to turn on the viper security system, make sure the windows are up, and leave the window cracked a bit for the dog inside. n.n"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "But you're taking the cat with you, I assume."

The Covenant complies readily, and soon they are riding between the trees rather than above them, with Kagarn, Sookie, and Kaliera aboard a stagecoach and Saeren riding alongside atop Shade. Thus it is that they arrive at the greatest still-standing human citadel of Stormwind, famed bsation of the Alliance.

> (OOC) Kaliera cues the Stormwind music

> (OOC) Sookie drops to 6 frames per second

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "male chorus sanjo!"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "that's only when you get to the AH, Sookie."

Apart from Sookie, the members of the Covenant have seen human citadels before - but they have all been ruins, like the moldering stone of Lordaeron atop the Undercity, or the briefly-glimpsed ramparts of sacked Stromgarde. Stormwind is different. Gleaming white limestone fills the mountain valley, its towers manned with bowmen and armed with cannons and siege weaponry. Stormwind Keep itself can be seen rising behind, banners flying in the brisk breeze that gave the city its name.

Great gates, large enough that the Audacious itself could pass between them, stand open to commerce for the time being, but are ready to pose a formidable barrier to any would-be invasion. Beyond them, in the Valley of Heroes a bridge just wide enough for cart traffic is overlooked by the statues of great heroes of Stormwind and its Alliance allies. And, not incidentally, by yet another crenellated rampart.

Sookie rubs her chin thoughtfully as she studies the works. "Tough to take apart," she muses half-aloud.

"I would rather be hunting dragons," mutters Saeren. Or at least hunt them in other places. "With a little luck, we won't have to stay long."

Kaliera looks out the window. "...not quite as interesting as the Exodar, but still, quite interesting architecture."

A mounted soldier is waiting, with an honor guard. "Greetings, members of the Covenant. I am General Marcus Jonathan," he says, bowing in the saddle. "What is your business in Stormwind?"

> (OOC) Sookie is cowering but can be convinced to speak if need be. o\_o

Kaliera says, "We are here to bring information to the Council of Nobles, and to petition for assitance."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "That was way better than my version, Kaliera. ^^"

> (OOC) Kaliera hee

Jonathan nods politely. "We have heard much about your efforts elsewhere. Unfortunately, our Council of Nobles takes... some time to deliberate on matters." Only the faintest hint of impatience shows on his face. "In the meantime, we have guest quarters in the Keep, if you wish to remain there while you wait for their deliberations."

Kaliera says, "We shall be most happy to accept whatever hospitality Stormwind can offer at this difficult time, General. Please direct us, and we shall follow, and thank you for your kindness."

Saeren looks to Shade, and the animal cocks an ear at her before letting out a snort of a laugh. "I suppose it will have to do.. though I hope they can move swiftly enough for events not to overtake us all."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Saeren said that, not Shade. Don't want to give them heart attacks."

As Jonathan leads the Covenant through the streets, Jonathan remarks, "Some events have overtaken you already. Emissaries from the Undercity, of all places. It seems they are suing for peace in the Northlands. Everyone is talking about them."

At this news, Kaliera nods, serenely. "The threat of the Naga is great. If I recall properly, there is unguarded seacoast nearby which could be used for invasion. While it may be a peace of convenience, it could become one that lasts."

"In any case," Jonathan says, as the carriage comes to a stop outside the gates of the Keep, "we are here. I will show you to your quarters." Addressing Saeren, he adds "We have stables that will accomodate your nightsaber in comfort."

> (OOC) TidesGM swaps that.

"Stables?" asks Saeren, sounding distinctly unimpressed. "We don't stay apart. Shade isn't a normal cat." He's probably smarter than most of their politicians.

> (OOC) Saeren is going to make this poor guy uncomfortable.

Jonathan visibly controls the urge to guffaw, and even manages to deadpan, "Astonishingly, he is also larger than most of them. Very well, though I'm sure you understand that he must be on his best behavior. And please do not ride him through the halls!"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "d'oh."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "can it be? please? :D"

Kaliera says, "Also, General, I would appreciate if you could take the time to have your adjutant find the address of one of your men, Marshal Windsor." She pauses. "He was taken by the Blackrock Orcs and... did not survive. We would bring news to his family.""

> (OOC) TidesGM will fix, for now. I think Kaliera's is more important to respond to.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Hahah, if you want it to be out loud, it can be, gm ;)"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "no, no, I think having Kaliera's being after the bit of humor works."

The general's face falls. "Windsor has fallen? This is grave news. Windsor was one of the finest men I have ever had the honor to serve alongside. His loss is a blow to the Alliance." His voice grows quieter - for a moment, he is no longer a general of a great army, but a soldier who has lost a comrade. "How did he die, do you know?"

> (OOC) TidesGM replaces the joke line so I can swap it back into place, bear with me.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "was that last sentence out loud, Saeren? :)"

Shade looks at Jonathan, the cat's eyes studying him with interest. He stays close to Saeren for now, and remains silent, as was suggested to him, until matters here are clearly established.

Kaliera says, "The Blackrock orcs, and their masters, were not kind to prisoners. Others there were rescued, but we arrived after he had passed on."

"I... see." Once again Jonathan visibly composes himself. "I will notify his next of kin personally. Thank you for informing me. If you will step this way, please?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All right. You've got most of the day at large in Stormwind. You don't have the /full/ run of the palace, but you can go anywhere or talk to anyone you like in the city. Anything you want to know?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Yeah, what's the price on copper ore and copper bars.. gonna see if I can corner the market n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren actually has nothing on the agenda >.>

Once left alone by the soldiers of Stormwind, Sookie lets out a long-held breath. For years she was primed as the weapon to invade and reduce this city to ruin, told that it was the crucible of all wickedness in her world. Its destruction was to be her apotheosis. Now she is simply at a loss for words, and sits with a stricken look on her face.

Saeren settles into a chair, "Sookie, are you alright? You look.. off. I hate cities as well, so I can understand that feeling."

Kaliera calls for one of the castle servants, asking for some refreshments, then sits near Sookie as well.

"Masters in the cult said to destroy Stormwind," the girl murmurs. "Lady said the same thing, but meant something different. People in Lakeshire got no help from the city. So.. why are we even here?"

"To make things change," says Saeren. "For the better, if we do well."

Sookie absentmindedly reaches for Kaliera's bag of food, or where she thinks it is, but snaps her hand back without prompting. It seems that the Lady's lessons are still fresh in her mind. "Why we wait anyway? What's to deliberate?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Kagarn will step in if no one else does."

"Stormwind is one of the great powers of the world," says Kagarn. "Their assistance will be invaluable in the war against the naga. If we cannot get their assistance, our chances of victory diminish greatly." He rubs his horn absently.

"They haven't listened to us," protests Sookie. "What's to decide? They want to surrender to naga early?"

Kaliera says, "We know that someone is manipulating the city. We need to present what we know to them, to see two things: one, who immediately stands against us and two, if we can find out who is the manipulator in the city."

Sookie grumps. "Fine. I'll wait. But they better hurry."

> (OOC) Sookie got nothin else for now

"And then's there is the real job. Step three, destroying the enemy," adds Saeren. "That's more exciting than deliberation."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Did we recover anything of Windsor's, or did we not manage to find anything? I forget and it's not in the logs"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Negative. There was nothing of his in the dungeons, and you weren't entirely at liberty to search the rest of the keep."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anything else? Anyone you want to go and ask questions of? I know most of the party is combat focused, but Kaliera's got more social-oriented skills."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Sookie might have questions but she's still terrified of being in Stormwind. ^\_^"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Are you now?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "wouldn't you be?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All right, if there's nothing else, we'll proceed."

Kaliera speaks to the servant assigned to their quarters (which is fairly standard). "Could you please ask if I could see recent records of the meetings of the Council of Nobles? I would like to see what they have been deliberating, so that I make sure not to waste their time with information they already have."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "sorry, had to recycle some water."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "That's fine."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "this also lets me see who leads the 'don't send help' faction and gets us some information to work with."

The servant nods, and escorts the priestess to the public records hall. "Many of the deliberations are secret, of course," he says, "but those matters of public record are recorded here. If you have difficulty in finding what you seek, please ask a scribe."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "standby for the infodump."

Kaliera bows formally, in the Draenei fashion, and begins her reading. She expects that she will need to renew herself a few times during this, because oy, humans deliberate.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Stupid humans and their stupid talking. n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren should have Shade buy the language here and help read. :D

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "The Draenei have Velen. He says 'we should do this, figure out how', and the Draenei do that. If discussions get in the way of what Velen wants done, he shows up and clears his throat and discussions get much smoother."

And do they ever. An astonishing amount of the past several weeks' minutes is on minutiae, such as the reshingling of roofs in Old Town or regulating the price of Elwynn pumpkins. A few entries are of greater relevance, such as disruptions of wheat shipments from Westfall, or fishing from Redridge being in short supply; but any mention of these problems being due to Defias banditry or Blackrock marauders, respectively, is glossed over.

Kaliera looks to see if she can puzzle out the factions of Stormwind, or if perhaps those sorts of things - like, say, names - are considered 'secret'.

Stormwind is primarily organized along feudal lines. Every lord is seemingly a faction unto himself, most with property holdings either in Stormwind itself or in the surrounding lands. However, a few general trends can still be observed.

On the matter of external threats to Stormwind, many of the lords simply take a "wait and see" attitude toward all and sundry threats, and are focused solely on the gain to their own holdings. Some others, of a more expansionist bent, are interested in taking or retaking former human holdings in the north, most notably in the Arathi region, where the Forsaken have recently withdrawn. The smallest faction on the issue consists of lords whose holdings are in the outlying areas of the southeast, with allies amongst Knights of the Silver Hand and a few other orders who, while scattered all round, take a broader view than their compatriots.

Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker, the commander of Stormwind's paladins, is chief amongst this latter group. From the records Kaliera can read, he is one of the few of Stormwind's lords who has specifically advocated joining the Covenant. Unfortunately, any further discussion on the matter has been relegated to relevant subcommittees, whose deliberations are not amongst the public records.

The minutes have painted a grim political picture. Ironforge is held together by centuries of dwarven unity and forged by blood. The elves, even fractured by civil war are motivated by an existential threat from their millennium-old enemies. They were easy enough to sway because there was an old voice of tradition at the top which could be appealed to. But Stormwind is _young_ - too new for centuried traditions to carry much weight - and fractured, having been destroyed and rebuilt, and having lost the king who held the maelstrom of self-interest in check. This will not be easy.

Kaliera makes notes on this, then thanks the archivist for assistance and returns to their quarters. Upon arrival, she relays what she has learned, then says, "I think I need to speak to Lord Shadowbreaker. Thankfully, I have a cunning ruse to make it much easier."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "GM plz swap those"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "yes plz. didn't know dump wan't over x.x"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Done."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I asked to throw something extra in :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. Any further details, Kaliera?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Nope. Was waiting for conversation, now that I know this. we can't really see from this any influence, but we can see people who may side with us on the discussions, and be willing to introduce us to the Council, which is also important."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All right. What's your next move?"

Kaliera uses some minor magics to cleanse her robes and polish her staff, gathers one of her holy books, and begins to make her way to the Cathedral of Stormwind. Her interest in the human insight to the ways of the Light is obvious; her desire to speak to Lord Shadowbreaker, perhaps, less so.

Following along is Sookie, doing her best to avoid notice. She might look like a pickpocket to observant eyes, were she to actually steal anything, but staying put feels oppressive enough now.

Stormwind Cathedral is, if rather smaller than the Keep, still a marvelous work of stonemasonry. Outside of regular worship services, it is not heavily populated, but there are a number of priests on hand, to meet the spiritual needs of individuals who seek absolution, encouragement, or solace. The draenei priestess turns a few heads on her arrival, but she is not the first of her kind to make a pilgrimage here.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Are you openly seeking an audience with Lord Shadowbreaker, or trying to be more subtle?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Trying to be more subtle."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Roll Diplomacy, then."

> (OOC) Kaliera rolls 3d6 for 10 (6 3 1)

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "...diplomacy of 14 base skill"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "You succeed in gaining an audience with His Lordship, /and/ the priests will go out of their way to keep the nature of your errand from being obvious. Would you like to pose the details, or shall I?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "if you please?"

> (OOC) Sookie will be lurking here too, if possible.

> (OOC) Saeren might as well lurk along. Taking Shade if possible.

For all their warm and compassionate manner, the priests of Stormwind Cathedral are also quite sharp of wit as well - and in a very real sense, they are on the same side as their sister in the Light. A few brief conversations, which touch only vaguely on concerns about the naga, are quickly routed to a confessional booth where Kaliera is able to discuss her intent more frankly, and she and her companions are soon led into the cellars beneath the cathedral, out of public view.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Shade will probably draw too much attention to the private audience. :)"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "juuuust a little."

It is not long after that they are joined by a raven-haired man, whose robes bear the heraldry of the Silver Hand. "I am Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker," he says. "I understand you have business with me?"

Kaliera gives a formal bow. "Greetings, Lord Shadowbreaker. I am Soulspeaker Kaliera, and these are my companions in the Covenant of the Grail, Sookie and Saeren. We wish to speak to you about certain issues outside of Stormwind, as we have just come from Redridge with news from there.

"Redridge," says Grayson with a heavy sigh as he sits down at the meeting table. "What news from that troubled land? Do they still hold the line against the rogue Horde? Or has Magistrate Solomon finally run short of miracles?"

Kaliera says, "They hold the line. Indeed, with our assistance, one of the orc strongholds is not nearly so strong, and... uh... John Keeshan's squad was freed from them, to plan more actions."

(OOC) Kaliera has the 'uh' of 'let me make sure I recall this correctly'

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "was that last meant to be OOC?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "yes"

The paladin's eyebrows raise. "Bravo Company is free?" He smiles, and his shoulders seem to relax slightly. "That _is_ good news. There are few enough in Stormwind who understand what service you have done for this city, but count me among them."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "More?"

Kaliera says, "Magistrate Solomon also has allowed the Lamia to found a colony in the lake, which also will help with control of the murlocs, allowing the militia to focus on the orcs. Sadly, we discovered that Marshal Windsor had been captured and killed by the orcs. But all of these things lead me to ask: why is this happening? Why is Stormwind turning away from these territories?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "sorry, was working out what to say"

Lord Grayson sighs again, running his hand through his hair. "Ugh," he says. "Greed, greed and avarice. Every nobleman who had any holdings in Arathi or Hillsbrad is positively champing at the bit to reclaim those lands from the Horde, and they're willing to spend every last penny of Stormwind's coffers and every last soldier of our army to do it. And the Lady Regent is the worst of the lot.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "more"

"As you might know," continues the paladin, "His Highness Varian Wrynn has gone missing, and his son is far too young to take the throne as yet. Lady Katrana Prestor managed to get herself named the regent, and she's the one _leading_ the charge for the northlands. Between you and me, she's so obsessed with reclaiming her little slice of Alterac that she doesn't give a damn about Stormwind itself." He studies Sookie's face. "She especially would not be pleased to see _you_ around, young one. You look far too much like one of the Perenolde family."

Sookie blinks a few times, but says nothing. She's still timid where important people in Stormwind are concerned.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "He can yak on for a bit more, unless someone wants to ask him another question."

"...perhaps that's what she needs to see, then." A smile starts to cross Kaliera's face, and then she turns to Sookie, tilting her head appraisingly. "Yes, perhaps she needs to see just that."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sorry about afk, had to take out garbage leftovers after putting together the crib. ^^"

Grayson chews his lip. "You'd best be careful about that, then. Lady Prestor is the last person in Court that you'd want to cross, unless you have some powerful people in your corner. I'd be more than happy to wipe the smirk off her face myself, but I'm afraid the rest of the council has long since grown used to not listening to me."

Saeren looks to Kaliera, her face neutral, and then to Grayson. "We have some very powerful people in our camp." She pauses to think a moment, then asks, "Is there nothing that might force the council to move?"

Grayson snorts. "An army of naga slithering down the main street _might_ do the trick," he says derisively. "Short of that... well, now that the Forsaken are drawing back, maybe some of the northlander nobles will have time to think of something else for a while. And the dispossessed nobles of Westfall would have a lot more sway if the Defias could be driven off. Lady Prestor is the sticking point, ultimately. You'll have to either convince her - " his tone conveys an undertone of _good luck with that_ " - or have so much of the Council on your side that she won't dare try to stop you."

Saeren latches on to her own thoughts. She will let Kaliera steer the boat, but she adds quietly, "When you and Kaliera are done with other matters, perhaps you might tell me more about the Defias. I specialize in driving off troublemakers." Or just slaughtering them.

Kaliera speaks thoughtfully. "Well, no matter what, if we are to present to the Council, we must appear before them and dressed for the occation. The news and requests we bring should be presented, and we should all be in attendence. If there are assumptions made, well, it is not our fault if some jump to conclusions. And if that causes them to lose face...."

Grayson runs his hand through his hair again. "I'll draw up a list," he says. "The nobles who I've been working on behind the scenes, who are on the fence or who might be persuaded. Just bear in mind that all too few of the Council will be motivated by noble purposes or danger to humankind as a whole. Those of us who are like _that_ will already be in your corner."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Please swap mine and Kaliera's."

> (OOC) TidesGM adds more, as well.

"And if you can truly deal with the Defias Brotherhood, that will really turn the tide in our favor," adds Grayson. "I'll tell you what I know of them, but the man you really want to talk to about that is Baros Alexston. He was one of the Stonemasons before the rest of them revolted and became the Defias."

> (OOC) TidesGM needs to reboot, computer is going funny.

> (OOC) TidesGM is back on mac.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anything else with Grayson?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "nope"

> (OOC) Saeren hmmss..

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sorry, one more."

"I will speak to Baros Alexston," says Saeren. And for a moment, the War Wave flickers at her side. "And may the Light have mercy on the Defias. I won't."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "It's a level 20 instance, I can solo it npnp n.n"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "multishot multishot collect loot"

---

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Though honestly if our allies are tied up by a bunch of level 17s, I don't think they can rock with Ony."

Baros Alexston is the City Architect, and his residence, conveniently enough, is right on Cathedral Square. "Ah yes... the Defias," he says, sighing deeply. "That leads us to one of the more sordid areas of Stormwind's history."

"I am confident that I have the skills needed to solve this problem for you," says Saeren. "Tell me the whole story, and what you need from me to resolve it."

That history is summarized quickly enough: After Stormwind was razed by the demonic Orcish Horde in the course of the Second War, it was rebuilt, at great expense, by the Stonemason's Guild. The Council of Nobles, possibly even more corrupt then than now, refused to pay once the work was done, and the head of the Stonemasons, Edwin van Cleef, led the Stonemasons to riot and departed the city. Alexston himself preferred to work within the system, and accepted the position of City Architect; but the rest became the foundation of what is now known as the Defias Brotherhood.

Sookie goes from frightened listener to uttering an eerily proud chuckle at the mention of the keep's destruction. This part of the city's history is of great interest to her.

Regrettably, what once was a righteous revolt against corrupt nobility was in turn corrupted. In the effort to finance and support his efforts at revolution, van Cleef accepted the help of all manner of miscreants and ne'er-do-wells. The Defias of today bears little resemblance to the Stonemasons of Alexston's memory; now, they are little more than brigands, as apt to terrorize innocent farmers and ravage their lands as to fight the nobility head-on. The exact location of their headquarters is unknown, but it is believed to be somewhere in Westfall, where the Defias' depredations have been most strongly felt.

Sookie nodnods along as the story continues. She remembers the story of the Syndicate. It seems that history repeats itself.

"So, is this a simple matter then?" asks Saeren. "Just point me to them and sweep them all under the rug?"

> (OOC) Sookie jumps in?

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Go ahead."

A light goes on. More candle than bonfire, but Sookie visibly brightens. "No, wait," she interjects. A few silent moments pass while thought coalesces from the vapor of emotion. "I'll solve this. Defias will stop this. Promise."

Saeren turns to Sookie, "Very well." She smiles at the sudden change in the girl, though she can't help but admit she's a little disappointed. She would kill to get out of the city for a while. Literally.

Alexston leans back. "Really?" he says, looking surprised as his eyes move between the two women. "A nearly-organized but numerous band of ruffians that has plagued this kingdom for years, and you're going to make them stop? Just like that? I mean, I _have_ heard about Stonewatch, and I know you are very formidable indeed, but if you can pull this off, I _will_ be impressed."

Sookie smiles. "I'll make tea for them."

"If the tea doesn't work," adds Saeren, with a too-sweet smile, "I will leave not a single of them breathing."

Alexston stares at Sookie, slack-jawed. "You'll make tea for them," he says flatly. He glances at Saeren. "Frankly, I'd give _her_ plan better odds."

> (OOC) Sookie got nothin else for Alexston :)

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Well, it's almost 8:00, so it's a good time for closing poses for this session."

> (OOC) Sookie kicks in

---

A serious-looking young man, with dusky skin marred by battle-scars and disarranged black hair, presents himself at the Covenant members' quarters. He's dressed as any human traveler would be, but the sealed letter he presents bears the mark of Sylvanas Windrunner, the Banshee Queen. "I was there when Varimathras was slain. Read this, then burn it thoroughly. We Forsaken have not forgotten your words and deeds, night elf." With that, he draws his hood up and departs.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Does he mean he is giving my plan better odds, I assume ;)"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "aand one more"

The letter is simple, its handwriting familiar. "To the Dark Lady and the Forsaken: greetings. In the event of my death or disappearance, I had hoped that my past efforts will secure some measure of my legacy from a grateful people. To that end I request that the Forsaken propose a lasting peace treaty, or a pact of mutual non-interference at the least, with the Alliance on the eastern continent. The key to this is Alterac. Agree to any reasonable terms provided that a human of trustworthy name rules in Alterac. This last consideration is absolute. Undercity will accept a reliable Perenolde, for example. Events are transpiring which shall settle the matter with a rapidity and thoroughness which should satisfy any critic of my proposal. The survival of the Forsaken, so often disputed in wartime, now hinges upon achieving peace. Do not fail me. Victory for Sylvanas - E."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "And that was sent to me, huh? Looks like all hell is breaking loose. As usual n.n"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "to you guys, anyway. but the messenger only knows you"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Got ya."

> (OOC) Saeren poses.

Saeren takes the letter, reads it over carefully, then hands it over so Kaliera and Kagarn can read it as well. "He is missing, then," she says. She strides away, followed by Shade.

Kagarn nods, stoking the fire as Kaliera reads. "I feared as much when the Stonard emissary told us of his image's vanishing. It seems that we have a new mission here, now." He looks at Sookie. "And it seems Lady Prestor _will_ have reason not to relish the face of our companion."

Sookie looks downcast. "You too? What's wrong with my face? Blood, or scar?"

"Blood, you might say," says Kagarn. "Because you resemble the nobility of Perenolde, many here in Stormwind might well believe that you intend to claim your birthright. And unless they think they can _use_ you, they will be afraid, because you claiming your share might diminish their own." He shakes his head.

Sookie scratches her head. "Alterac. Just ogres up there. They fear _me_ more than ogres?" A smile creeps over her face at the thought. "... Good."

Kaliera nods, slowly. "Your resemblance, as Lord Shadowbreaker said, is very strong. That can be both a blessing and a curse in what we must do. But no matter what, we must be prepared." She rises from her chair. "I must go to the Trade District, and find a tailor." She regards the other three. "It does not do to underdress for nobility." Then she regards Kagarn for a moment, with a small smile. "Especially you. Let us show them the glory of the tauren."

> (OOC) Sookie has dress for this occasion! well, one dress.

> (OOC) Saeren generally just hides and kills people before they see what she's wearing n.n

> (OOC) Sookie says, "that will not work for state functions n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm not so sure n.n"

Kagarn nods. "It would be well for me to not appear before the nobility of Stormwind any more than is necessary. We do not wish to distract them with fears of the Horde. But since they _will_ have to overcome those fears to join the Covenant, I see the wisdom of your words."

> (OOC) Sookie is good for today.

Kaliera says, "They will need to overcome their fears eventually. We must all put our best face forwards. I will go hire tailors."

> (OOC) Saeren has no poses for now, having stomped off to be by herself. :)

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I think, in that case, we're good for today. Next time should be interesting, if I can do what I have in mind properly. :D"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "yaay"
