# Turning Tides 2012-04-08

> (OOC) Log "Tides-2012-04-08" started by TidesGM at Sun Apr 8 18:54:23 2012 CDT (OOC)

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Would you guys at all be likely to be posting watches while residing at Stormwind Keep?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Sookie's no longer Paranoid, so probably not! but she'll also tend to stay up late and not sleep much, so take that as you will."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Shade is basically always on guard, so. :)"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Kaliera would set an alarm spell but keyed so that our people wouldn't set it off."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "The last thing we need is some noble sending their house assassin-they-don't-have to kill off Kagarn or something."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Good thinking, Kaliera. Which spell, specifically?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Watchdog"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "and possibly Nightingale on the shutters if we can do that."

Kaliera's dreams are disturbed as the Light draws her into sudden wakefulness. She opens her eyes just in time to watch one of the portraits on the wall move aside, and an arm extend, aiming a rune-carved stick toward the sole candle burning in its sconce.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I assume Kaliera will call out. Everyone but Kaliera make an IQ roll to wake up, +6 if you have Combat Reflexes."

> (OOC) Sookie has it via magic item, but would be wearing those anyway, so:

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 10 (2 5 3) vs. 16, succeeding by 6

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Windsor needs not make a roll either, as he Doesn't Sleep."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Shade, then me."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "And IQ or Per?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "IQ."

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d for 13 (6 4 3) vs. 14, succeeding by 1

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Per would be if you were trying to hear them sneaking across the floor, but that's irrelevant because they haven't had time to cast Silence yet."

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d for 12 (2 4 6) vs. 13, succeeding by 1

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Both Shade and Saeren are up. :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 16 (4 6 6) vs. 15, failing by 1

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Shade moves at 28 ground speed, so he's probably gonna get there very fast n.n"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Someone poke Kagarn as you go by."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. Saeren, roll 1d6+3."

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 1d6+2 for 7 (5 2)

Kaliera calls out a warning, and draws her power together to begin casting a spell.

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 1d6+3 for 7 (4 3)

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "And let's begin, then. What is Saeren and Shade's basic speed?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "shade is 7, saeren is 6."

> (OOC) Saeren is naturally going to shoot first, ask questions when Kaliera summons their ghost.

At Kaliera's shout, the portrait slams aside and a black-clad figure bursts into the room, only his eyes visible above the scarlet mask that covers the rest of his face. He does not speak, but hurls a black-bladed dagger immediately toward the night elven sentinel.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Do I have the chance to parry with my weapon, or only dodge?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I'm going to assume the room is no bigger than 9 yards. Parry is valid."

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 5 (1 2 2) vs. 17, succeeding by 12

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Going to parry in that case."

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d for 10 (5 1 4) vs. 12, succeeding by 2

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Pose success. (What's everyonee lse's bsaic speed, while we're at it?)"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "basic speed 7.0 with gear, effective DX 16"

The War Wave is brought to bear immediately, the weapon in the form of a sai at the moment. The enemies throw is knocked harmlessly aside and the night elf seeks the eyes of her enemy.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. Shade and Sookie next, assuming Sookie has the relevant gear."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "How big is this guy? Human size, orc size?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I'm kind of assuming Kaleria isn't at this sort of speed. The guy in the room is apparently human - pink-skinned what you can see, and the same is probably true of the other."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Kaliera's move is 6.75"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. You'll be after shade and sookie."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Speed, I mean."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "k"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "This is what they get for not having enough intel on Kaliera, btw."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So Sookie first, or Shade? Shade is 16 dex. He's probably better at dealing with the exposed guy, honestly."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "DX tie, you guys decide."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sookie, can I reveal any hidden tricks with Shade? He doesn't have as much flexibility."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "what do you mean?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Meaning can I go first just to flush out any special tricks they have, or would you like to hit them first?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "oh. eh, go ahead."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Going to use Shade's attack and extra attack on the exposed guy, assuming I'm able to reach him."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "It would be Move and Attack, I think, since he wouldn't have landed that close to Shade."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Actually, I'll just slaw this bastard. Rolling to hit him."

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d for 9 (2 6 1) vs. 18, succeeding by 9

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "But on the other hand Shade has more than enough move to get anywhere in the room."

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 8 (6 1 1) vs. 15, succeeding by 7

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Woosh."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Move & Attack caps your skill at 9 unless it's a slam, as usual."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Yeah, so slam was the choice :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "He dodged really well."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So he's got a ridiculous dodge. Good to know."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "But he still takes a penalty vs. invisible opponents, such as..."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So he's going to be tk'ed and ghost slaughtered. Nice knowing him n.n"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "TK Grapple, deceptive attack (-2 to his defenses over and above the penalty), targeting the neck (-3)"

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 6 (1 2 3) vs. 16, succeeding by 10

> (OOC) Sookie says, "second action: lightning bolt! n.n"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Things went bad for them the moment they had to engage while Sookie was conscious."

Shade rushes down the enemy, who moves gracefully out of the path of the cat, who passes by harmlessly.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "due to the grapple the dodge is at -1 and they can't retreat or use acrobatic dodges."

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 12 (4 4 4) vs. 23, succeeding by 11

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 11 (2 3 6) vs. 13, succeeding by 2

Sookie wields her control over wind and motion to arrest the intruder. A follow-up blast of lightning, however, just barely misses him.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Kaliera!"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So is he grappled successfully, Bill?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "yes"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Which means next round he's cat food.. assuming he somehow survives the ghost."

Kaliera reaches into the Light, for knowledge and power, and channels in towards the killer; not with intent to kill, or even to harm, but to do something to make it easier for her friends to deal with him.

> (OOC) Kaliera rolls 3d6 for 15 (5 6 4) vs. 15, succeeding by 0

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "And this was?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "whew! Spell successfully cast: Tickle. Roll HT to resist, otherwise he starts to spasm."

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 15 (3 6 6) vs. 14, failing by 1

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Equivalent to a seizure."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Death by tickle."

Kaliera exhales... and the assassin starts to twitch, and then emits his first noise... a giggle.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "If you don't kill him off, he's giong to die of shame. :>"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "I don't NEED to try to kill him, I have you guys. I just am making it a bit easier."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "What does this do to his dodge? o.O"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "he can do nothing during the spell duration of one minute."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "You guys will pretty much be able to take care of him."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "If he survives Kaliera is going to cast flatulence next."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, " Seizure: You suffer a fit of some kind. Your limbs tremble uncontrol- lably, you fall down if standing, and you cannot speak or think clearly. You can do nothing. At the end of the seizure, you lose 1d FP. -- campaigns p 429"

There is a muffled curse, then a deep breath, and the outline of the extended hand, from the assassin still lurking behind the portrait, begins to waver and blur.

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Flatulence isn't a spell in itself, but a variation of 'perfume'. :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Stench as a body control spell? :D"

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 14 (4 6 4) vs. 15, succeeding by 1

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I'm awake! I'm awake!"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Can Shade see the waver/blurring hand with his vision?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Grats to Kagarn on managing to wake up n.n"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "The spell affects his ability to attack normally - the man's image is blurred on all wavelengths. A successful blind-fighting roll would negate it."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'll let the AoE experts deal with that one n.n"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Strike in an area - it is the only way to uncover the real one!"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK, seriously. Round 2: Assassin 1 wriggles and twitches helplessly as he dangles by his neck."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Sookie and Shade!"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Choke for suffocation. this is a quick contest, my effective ST of 31 vs the better of his ST or HT. it's crushing damage equal to the margin of victory, DR protects (if he has any), and 1 FP/turn is lost due to suffocation."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Oh! First... what does Marshal Windsor do to anyone?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "I would suggest he tries to hit the one in the tunnel."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "GM, does air vision, see invis, or sound vision help?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. Move and attack. See invisible /will/ help."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Is that innate attack ranged, though? If so, just normal attack."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Then to Saeren his spell is as effective as shouting 'u suk' n.n"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I didn't see you buy down Innate Attack to melee, Kaliera, so roll your Innate Attack skill -3."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "I didn't think of it that way, so..."

> (OOC) Kaliera rolls 3d6 for 8 (5 2 1) vs. 12, succeeding by 4

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 8 (1 5 2) vs. 13, succeeding by 5

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Still misses."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Hammers are perfectly valid throwing weapons!"

The ghost of Marshal Windsor appears suddenly, yelling "For the Light, and for Stormwind! Fall, assassin!" He brings back his hand, throwing a ghostly hammer at the shimmering assassin... and just barely misses.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK, now we resolve the Choke."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Do we scale that down at all? His ST or HT is nowhere near 31."

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 12 (3 6 3) vs. 22, succeeding by 10

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 12 (4 5 3) vs. 10, failing by 2

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 12 (5 2 5) vs. 17, succeeding by 5

> (OOC) Sookie says, "and these are the guys we try to keep alive. o.o;;"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Well he's not unconscious yet, but he's heading in that direction. Pose him gasping."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "well, not gasping. he can't manage gasping."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Well, I figure we should be able to not kill one of them... probably."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "While Sookie slowly strangulates hers, Shade gets to go deal with the other one."

Sookie grips and twists, mimicking the actions of her magic with her outstretched hands. Aside from the convulsions, the would-be assassin is thoroughly strangulated.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "The other one is still basically invis.. can I even attempt to deal with him?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "He's not invisible, you just take -3 to attack rolls."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Oh, okay. Mauling him with my two normal attacks."

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d for 12 (2 5 5) vs. 15, succeeding by 3

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d for 6 (2 1 3) vs. 15, succeeding by 9

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 14 (4 5 5) vs. 13, failing by 1

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 11 (3 2 6) vs. 13, succeeding by 2

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "One hits."

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d for 14 (2 6 6) damage

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Impaling.. and if any gets through, he gets another 2d burning moonfire."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Just in case I need the 2d.."

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 2d for 5 (4 1)

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "2 /dice/? Yow. :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Impalling means what, 2x modifier after DR?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "yes"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "That's right."

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 16 (4 6 6) vs. 15, failing by 1

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Oh man, tough luck for him. Shade takes him down."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "These guys don't have /superhuman/ HT, but they've got a lot. Just... not enough."

The wavering form of the second attacker doesn't phase Shade. The cat lashes out two with his massive paws. One of the attacks hits home, levelling the foe with horrific claws and a burst of pure moonlight.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "He's not dead yet. But he won't be going for a walk now."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Ah, okay.. fixing."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "There, changed killing to levelling.. since I think he's probably not going to be mobile n.n"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "You guys have basically won - the only technically mobile assassin is being tickled and choked. Saeren, do you want to wait until Sookie's foe stops moving, or do you want to help it out a bit?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I think we got him n.n"

The remaining assassin continues to twitch helplessly for a little while longer but eventually the lack of oxygen takes his toll and he dangles limply from Sookie's invisible grasp on his neck.

Sookie looks between her companions' faces. "No killing," she mumbles, sounding curiously dejected. "What now?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Yeah, no need to hit people who aren't going to do much."

"We need to find out who they are and where they came from." She looks to the others. "I suggest we strip them down completely. I don't want to have any surprises. Not so much as a ring on their fingers."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Saeren?"

Indeed, Kaliera agrees, and gets to work. As she does, the Marshal's ghost fades away, except perhaps for a slight glimmer from time to time - he is angry about this cowardly attempt in this city.

The gear these assassins carry is varied. Both of their outfits are embroidered with expensive black thread, nearly invisible against the dark fabric and leather, but potent in their enchantments. The cloth-dressed one carried something akin to a quiver, stocked with a variety of enchanted wands; the other's daggers have dark blades that appear to have been carved of some black ivory that is unnaturally warm to the touch.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "vendor vendor vendor DE vendor"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "hey I should be able to equip the wands, and with the right macro..."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Sookie - the dagger blades have a whiff of corrupted earth magic to them, similar to what you may have detected from the dragon you fought."

> (OOC) Sookie will hang onto a couple of those then

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK, now that you've stripped them, now what?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "And now, we cut off their fingers... er.. I mean ask questions."

Kaliera reaches for the Light again, to cast a spell to allow her to detect poisons. Sure, they say that poison-filled teeth are only in books, but still, let us be careful.

Sookie takes charge of a pair of daggers that caught her eye. "Goshi, I'll follow their path back," she reports, then makes for the hidden entrance the assassins used.

"Let us restrain these two first, and then go together," advises Kagarn. "There may be others hidden in these tunnels."

Shade looks to Kagarn, sniffing at the subdued enemies. "I can follow them back easily whenever we wish," he announces.

"However we restrain them, we need to make sure they can't possible break free," adds Saeren. "And even if we delay a short time we have the skills here to follow the trail."

Sookie waits for Saeren to look away, then lightly swats the enormous cat on the nose. "I work to talk. You cheat. Hush up," she mutters.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Who's got rope, handcuffs, or a portable jain in their packs? :D"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Dan Fielding."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "jail."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Nice reference!"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Saeren would have rope, she has knot-tying skill."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. Go ahead and roll your Knot-Tying skill. Should they regain consciousness, we'll use that as their target for any Escape they might make."

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d for 10 (3 2 5) vs. 16, succeeding by 6

> (OOC) Saeren says, "How badly hurt are they right now?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Kaliera would have taken actions to stabilize them if they were going to die quickly."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "They're both stabilized, but still in negative HP land."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "In addition to making ure they didn't have poisons in their teeth."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I was more wondering if I should break their legs, but that's just me o/~"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "If you want to take precautions against their escape while you explore their entryway, may I suggest Sleep?"

> (OOC) Kaliera can do that! \*baaa\* wait, sleep, not sheep \*zzzz\*

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All right. I can pose it up real quick, and then you can go hunting, if you like."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sure."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "That's a much more humane tactic than my way. n.n"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Well, Saeren's a savage."

Saeren takes great care in ensuring that the assassins' restraints are most securely fastened, fully aware that many assassins train themselves in techniques to escape such bonds. As an added precaution, Kaliera lays a 'blessing' of the Light upon them, ensuring that they will slumber peacefully despite their wounds - and despite the fact that they would, no doubt, much prefer to be awake.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Equipping all gear, etc. Turning war wave into bow again."

With these precautions taken, the Covenant ventures behind the portrait. The tunnel branches almost immediately... and again... and again. The inside of the Keep is positively _riddled_ with secret passages, and it is only Shade's uncanny sense of smell and Saeren's keen eye for the slightest traces of footprint or handprint that allow them to follow the trail at all...

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Go ahead and have Shade roll Tracking, with all relevant bonuses."

Kaliera says, "...considering that this Defias Brotherhood was stonemasons, it seems they prepared for problems - or at least to cause problems - from the very start. This does not look like it was recently bored."

"I'm recently bored too," mumbles Sookie, clearly not enjoying the tunnel crawl.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Saeren?"

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d for 10 (1 4 5) vs. 27, succeeding by 17

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sorry, mid-dinner :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Fair enough. :) There would be other rolls, but with those kind of bonuses it'd take a critical failure, and that isn't interesting."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "He's basically ridiculous on the scent. n.n"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "How is he with ladders?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "He prefers elevators."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "But he is a cat, so if it can handle his weight, he's fine n.n"

After several minutes of crawling down dark dank tunnels, the group finds their way to a blank wall. "I doubt they were born here," remarks Shade, "so there must be a way through."

"It would be many things," replies Saeren. "Perhaps a one way wall, so they would have to return another way, or some hidden switch, or another dozen things." She looks to Kaliera and Kagarn, "Do you sense anything?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "GM, going to also investigate the ceiling and floor."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Sounds good. What are you rolling? Just Perception?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Actually, yeah, let's have perception rolls all round, just to make it clear who's got this."

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 8 (4 2 2) vs. 15, succeeding by 7

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 10 (2 2 6) vs. 14, succeeding by 4

Kaliera hms, thinking. "I might be able to try something...."

> (OOC) Kaliera rolls 3d6 for 10 (3 1 6) vs. 14, succeeding by 4

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d for 11 (2 5 4) vs. 16, succeeding by 5

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d for 13 (5 5 3) vs. 15, succeeding by 2

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Saeren, then Shade."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Looks like everyone figured it out anyway :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "For Shade, is that without the bonuses he gets for enhanced senses, on the assumption that I'd add in the relevant bonus?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Also, Kaliera, did you have something specific you were working on"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Waiting to see what else happens before taking an action. Which would be trying to cast Glass Wall on the wall on the right of us to see if I can see anything through it."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Yeah, I left them out.. he's got a bunch of possible enhancements."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Kaliera, to clarify: are you casting it on the terminal wall itself, or to the right?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Ah, okay, sorry, back read, misinterpreted. The terminal wall, then, would be best."

It quickly becomes clear, as the adventurers search for several minutes, that either the opening mechanism is too cleverly hidden for them to detect, or that it is a one-way passage. Kagarn and Sookie both confirm that there is no discernible elemental magic to speak of, either; whatever opens this wall is mundane in nature.

Kaliera, on the other hand, has a different approach. The Light grants her a vision through the stone of the wall, and on the other side she can see that it opens into a small crevasse in the rock outside the city walls. Though the walls are dressed stone, it seems this passage leads outside the city entirely.

Kaliera says, "...fascinating."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "If only you had some way of getting through a stone wall."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "... I'll break it down?"

> (OOC) Kaliera was waiting for someone else to respond to stuff x.x

> (OOC) TidesGM grins.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "alright! here goes then."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Whoa whoa hold on"

> (OOC) Sookie pauses

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "What I meant to say was "If only you knew someone who could go through a stone wall, hint hint cough.""

> (OOC) Sookie says, "but I like breaking things. ;\_;"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "But since Allies are tecnically NPCs, I can actually take matters into my own hands. :) In the interest of keeping things moving..."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Oh, GM. While we're doing that, Shade is going to take time to listen (including subsonic hearing) to see if any noise can be detected. Acture hearing is +3, as well."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "yes, that's what I was thinking, technically NPCs - so if you need him to do aught, wave the fingerpuppet around :)"

"Allow me, milady," says the marshal's voice from thin air. There is a soft breeze, and Kaliera can see the ghost pass through the wall. Several minutes of silence pass, and then there is a clunking sound. The stone in front of them shivers, then moves back several feet, and then to one side. The Marshal's shade is kneeling in the grass beside the passage, smiling. "Sorry about that. The opening mechanism is most cleverly hidden. I would never have found it if I had not known it was here."

Kaliera bows. "My thanks to you, Marshal."

With no further obstruction, Shade is now free to stretch his legs and continue to follow the backtrail - and now that they are in woodland rather than dressed stone, he hardly even needs to put his nose to the ground. In no time at all, he calls a halt. "I hear a campfire," he whispers.

"Let's go then," whispers Sookie in return. While not supernaturally skilled, she's able to stay out of sight competently. Moreso with the dwarves' gifts.

"I'll scout it out," replies Saeren quietly. Like a ghost herself, she moves forward, all but vanishing as she goes.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Going to sneak up, then sneak back."

Kaliera lacks stealthing skills, and simply remains back, allowing the others to do what do they well.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "no smell, mage stealth, see invis, sound vision, air vision all up."

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d for 12 (5 5 2) vs. 18, succeeding by 6

> (OOC) Saeren says, "..."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Just in case a roll is needed."

Sookie, Saeren, and Shade quickly find their way to the campsite, where they see two people lit from behind by the campfire, beside a small tent. Shade can hear the sounds of breathing from the tent nearby, with perhaps half a dozen sleepers inside.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "We come back and share that with everyone."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "One thing before you do that"

It is hard to see many details from the nearer watch-keeper, but the one standing opposite the fire has her back clearly lit. A red cloth is tied around her face behind her head, evidently the characteristic red mask of the Defias.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "We share that too."

> (OOC) Saeren poses that..

The stealth party returns to their companions. The three of them swiftly relay just what they've seen, with critical additions and enemy estimates from each. "So," says the night elf, "How can we do this with minimal killing?"

A sudden thought overtakes Sookie. It's unusual, but it happens. "All rooms have such tunnels?" she asks. "If not, who gave us that one?"

Saeren looks at Sookie thoughtfully, "A very good point." Her voice makes it clear she's storing that away for later. "What's our objective with these people right now? Can they fit into our greater plans? Or are they simply a problem to remove?"

Kaliera says, "General Jonathan led us to it, but I would expect someone keeps track of the available rooms in the keep... but the keep was built by those who are now the Defias."

Sookie frowns. "Okay. Just two on watch? I go get them."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "barring someone stopping me, gonna stealth over, grab the two in a headlock to prevent them opening their mouths and calling out, and carry them back here."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "They pretty much don't have a chance. These are mooks."

The girl darts off into the darkness. A bit later she comes strolling back, carrying two haplessly struggling figures held fast, and deposits them in front of Saeren and Kaliera.

The two sprawl on the ground, wide-eyed and frantic. "Who the hell _are_ you people?" says one, gasping and rubbing her jawline.

Kaliera smiles benevolently. "We are the Covenant of the Grail, and we stand between you and probable execution. Assist us and we can remain there. Do not assist, and we shall step out of the way you will take to the noose."

"Or just do the work ourselves," interjects Saeren. "Who the hell are you? Why shouldn't I pay you back for trying to kill us?" She holds the war wave at the ready, it's just a matter of a smooth draw and she'd have them both down in a second.

The woman shakes her head, her voice only slightly muffled by the mask. "P-please don't kill us! What do you want to know?"

Sookie pulls out the daggers she'd appropriated earlier. "Whose are these?" she asks.

The Defias woman (her other companion is simply cowering wordlessly on the grass) visibly flinches. "Y-you.... those..." She blinks. "I don't know their names. They're elite assassins for the Brotherhood. We were just to keep camp here for when they came back."

> (OOC) Sookie has a plan here. you guys object?

> (OOC) Kaliera nope

"They won't be returning anytime soon," says Saeren. She looks to Sookie, Kagarn, and Kaliera, "I'm not inclined to any set course of action. What is your command concerning these little ones and their friends at the camp?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Go for it Sookie, I'm just trying to scare them into being open to anything we might go for."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "GM, how old is the defias woman, btw?"

Sookie slides the daggers away again, and rubs her hands together. She's grinning, really widely, at the watchmen. "Hey, we took care of those two pretty fast. Who do you have that's better than elite? Want to meet them."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Young adult, mid-20's."

She swallows. "Better than that? You'd... you'd probably have to go after Van Cleef himself..."

Sookie's still grinning. She looks hungry, and happy. "Van Cleef. Okay! What was your plan, after elite victims came out here? Where to?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "no no no please no don't wanna run deadmines again.... \*twitch\* \*foam\*"

She shakes her head. "We... _we_ were just going to go back to our camp by... er..." She catches Saeren's eye briefly and flinches. "by Mirror Lake." She squeezes her eyes tight shut.

"Okay!" Sookie turns back to the others. "I'll stay here, serve tea to the others. Want to go turn in the assassins?"

Kaliera says, "All right. Don't stay out too late." She turns to walk back to the door."

Saeren looks at Sookie and raises an eyebrow. "I will leave Shade with you, Sookie. He loves tea." She turns away, looking back over her shoulder at the terrified defias girl, "I will let you and your friends live, little one. But I have a price for my mercy, and you _will_ pay it back later or I shall withdraw my gift regardless of what others might wish."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I hope Sookie actually has tea. :P"

> (OOC) Sookie will improvise.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "we stopping here, or have you got more to do, GM?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "This is a good place to stop for now!"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "okay. briefly I'm gonna go back to that camp and abuse kidneys until the Defias there stop trying to fight or run, and just keep them corralled for awhile until the others get back."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I think I'm fine stopping log here, actually. We can get on with shaking down Defias next time!"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "k"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "o/~ Shake, shake, shake defias...."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "In any case, next time I try sending assassins like that at you I'm definitely going to make them take more time setting their trap!"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "yes plz."
