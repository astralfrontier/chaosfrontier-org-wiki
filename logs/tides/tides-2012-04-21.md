# Turning Tides 2012-04-21

The Defias camp isn't hard to spot from the air. Most people would have to look up, through the thick canopy of trees characteristic of Elwynn Forest, to notice the few campfire plumes rising beyond the defile. Sookie need only look down.

She alights in one of the trees and sneaks close, moving silently from branch to branch. She finds what she expected: men on picket duty at both sides of the defile. One by one these unfortunates find themselves draw noiselessly into the treetops and choked into unconsciousness.

Two dozen bandits remain. From the descriptions given earlier, these must be the lower tier members of the Defias Brotherhood. Sookie drops to the ground in the middle of the camp, water blades extended from both hands.

> (OOC) TidesGM has connected.

As the bandits rise and draw their own weapons, the girl flips one of her weapons into a reversed grip - to strike and stab behind her. She'll be surrounded very quickly.

The Defias need no prompting. As one, they shout and charge. Sookie needs no answering battle-cry. She's learned from the Lady. No wasted motion, every action part of a greater design. As they come, man after man is struck by some tremendous force. They stagger and fall, but their companions press forward.

The closest ones are the first to learn to appreciate the power of water at high speed. Sookie shears through their blades, and those who attack in turn find their swords sliced in two as the girl meets them.

Those whose attacks she cannot parry, she dodges - melting nimbly away from thrust after thrust of the bandits' weapons. More of them fall thanks to her unseen power, and those that have the temerity to try and rise again are choked into submission or unconsciousness.

Sookie retreats to the stone wall of the defile, leaving behind a trail of unconscious corpses and broken swords. Soon the attackers in front of her realize that their reinforcements have fallen - within half a minute, only four remain conscious and standing. They throw down their weapons and surrender.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "so what happens now?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Well, this is the part where Sookie asks questions later. Also Kaliera, Kagarn, and Saeren see to tending and securing the fallen."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "okay."

"So the Defias want to hurt Stormwind?" Sookie asks of the battered and beaten bandits. "I was born a weapon. Raised to tear down the keep. Allied with the Old Horde. Are any of you so committed?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "how about it? :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I think there's time for one brief exchange."

Most of the Defias are too cowed to even speak. But one, possibly the band's leader judging by the slightly better armor, raises a hand timidly. "W-why did you change your mind?"

"Who says I did?" the girl asks sweetly.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "aaand that will lead to next time"
