The Defias encampment on Mirror Lake is broken, by a single young woman. Kagarn, tending the fallen, is impressed - of the twoscore thugs that tried to deal with the intruder, most were dispatched with no permanent injury, and only a handful are critically injured - and that only because they were more fragile than Sookie had anticipated.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "to be fair, those were the ones who chose to keep fighting in the sim. had they surrendered they'd survive."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I don't think she ever dealt a single blow that'd have forced a death check."

> (OOC) TidesGM fixes that.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All right. Now what do you do with them? And with the two marginally less flimsy assassins you've got in your quarters?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "we got the other PCs back now?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "if so:"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Sure. The plan was that Sookie would go in alone as a show of strength, and the others would be on hand in case of unexpectedly stiff resistance."

> (OOC) Kaliera can help heal them as well

When the others return, Sookie is sitting in the middle of a ring of unconscious Defias. Those that have woken up have not escaped; a few attempts have been made, leading to rather painful joint locks made possible by Sookie's fusion of power and technique. "Assassins came for us," she explains. "Someone put us in a trap. Let's take gang, assassins, and those people from the keep, and fly up. See who talks first."

> (OOC) Saeren can belittle their combat skills.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "unless there's objections I'll go make that happen"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "sounds good."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Let it be so."

Sookie herds the Defias who can walk; Saeren hustles the assassins; Kaliera and Kagarn keep the wounded up and moving with their respective forms of magic. Now for the Stormwind keep.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I'm actually confused now. What exactly is happening in the Keep? You ask the guards who's responsible for assigning rooms, then you track those people down and abduct them?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "yes"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "or 'invite' them out."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK, make it happen. Someone will think of inviting them into your lodgings. They won't be hard to cozen."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "throw a tea party"

On a pretext, Sookie manages to get one of the Stormwind castellan's men, Benedict Ames, to come aboard the _Audacious_ to discuss "an issue regarding the Covenant's other personnel on their way". Once aboard, the craft takes off to a height assuring that any fall will be fatal. And Sookie gets everyone into one of the bigger rooms.

The Defias assuredly know the assassins. The assassins presumably know the Defias. The question she has is: will anyone know the man from Stormwind, and vice versa? She looks from face to face for several seconds.

Benedict Ames looks bewildered. "What... what is this? I thought we were discussing Covenant personnel..." His brow furrows. "You haven't hired the _Defias_, have you?"

"They entered our room. The room you gave us," Sookie explains calmly. "Why that room?"

"They _what_?" says Ames, looking outraged and chagrined. Red-faced, he drops to one knee. "This is an unconscionable breach of our security, and I take full responsibility for allowing these... these _miscreants_ into your quarters. We will refer the matter to SI:7 immediately!"

Ignoring that, Sookie turns to the assassins. "Your turn. Why that room?"

The assassins glare stoically at Sookie, and say nothing.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "We're going to be rolling Interrogation checks to get anything out of them. Technically, we'd need them for the goons, but their effective Will score vs. Sookie is so low they'd need to critically succeed."

"Kagarn, Kaliera, you heal soon," promises Sookie. With a bored expression, she extends her power to the assassins' legs. There's a distinctive snapping sound. And in the wake of that, she ignores them in turn, looking at the gang. "Your turn. Why that room?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "...arg, was looking something up, missed that."

One of the two assassins cries out in agony; the other grits his teeth but is clearly sweating. The scream has an electric effect on the Mirror Lake thugs, and they start babbling all at once. The commotion is quickly stifled with an abrupt hand-gesture from Sookie, but asking them individually has the same effect: they had no knowledge of the details of the plan, just orders to provide a safe house for the assassins.

Satisfied, Sookie turns back to the assassins. "One leg, two arms, one neck left," she points out. "Still quiet?"

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 11 (4 6 1) vs. 9, failing by 2

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 12 (1 6 5) vs. 12, succeeding by 0

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "...I doubt that attempting Sway Emotions would help at this point."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I have just the group in mind for that, coming up"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Sookie, what's your Intimidation?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "default, IQ is 10"

Kaliera turns away from the sound of the breaking bones, clearly uncomfortable.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Sway Emotion to make Sookie merciful might be helpful actually.."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "It takes 10 minutes to pull off."

Sweating under Sookie's gaze, one of the assassins speaks up. "The... we have someone on the inside. Code named Silk. He... gave us the orders, and the location."

"Got orders and location how?" Sookie asks calmly. The assassin who remained silent feels his undamaged leg grabbed hold of, but nothing happens to it - yet.

"Don't... know," says the talkative one. The other one's jaw ripples, as he grits his teeth harder.

The girl nods. Her instincts are still back in the cave: _kill them, dump them all, go murder Defias._ But a flame has been lit, and she has learned for better or worse that there are other ways of doing things. Back to Benedict Ames: "Write a letter to SI:7. Saeren will deliver it. You stay here. Letter should bring someone here. Understand?"

Sookie stands, and turns her attention to Saeren. "Nobody else here can read people. Need you to bring back someone who we can trust, who can act. I promise... you aren't leaving these men with a monster."

Ames has gone deathly pale as the interrogation proceeds. "You, you suspect-" he begins, then cuts off, nodding. "I will... be happy to answer any other questions you have, while we wait. Just not in front of..." His face twists in disgust as he nods to the Defias. "They know too much already."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Shall I go on with the content of the letter Ames writes? I assume you'll want to review it before sending it on."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I assume we'll vet it and send it."

Sookie smiles sweetly. To Kaliera and Kagarn: "Okay. Heal the one who talked." And she looks most directly at Kaliera, noting the look of distaste. "I hate silence. His closed mouth or his leg. Which can you fix easier?"

Kaliera does not respond, but bends to the task of healing the legs of the one who spoke.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Please pose the letter :)"

As Sookie continues the interrogation, Ames begins to write, speedily but with meticulous attention to penmanship: "Dearest Mathias Shaw, An assassination attempt was made within the Keep, against members of the Covenant of the Grail. They have foiled the plot and captured the assassins, and are attempting to determine how the assassins determined which room contained the targets. The assassins spoke of an informant code-named 'Silk' who compromised my office's records." There follows a list of the personnel Ames knows who have access to the Keep's accommodation records. "Please send appropriate personnel to assist with the investigation at once. Regards, Benedict Ames."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "alright. let's get that delivered and see what happens"

> (OOC) Saeren poses doing that :)

Once the letter has been checked carefully Saeren directs the ship to swoop down long enough for her to vault off on Shade, heading to deliver the urgent message to Mr. Shaw. The night elf has her weapons ready, just in case there is still more trouble brewing for her.

Saeren is stopped only at the doors of SI:7 itself, with the stone-faced operative behind the desk accepting Ames's letter and trying to send her on her way. It is not long, though, before a ginger-haired man arrives at the desk at a dead run, carrying a parcel under one arm. "Saeren, is it? Good, I'm glad you waited. I've got people heading up to the keep now to round up the castellan's men. Could you give me a ride to your airship?"

"Just hold on tight," replies Saeren. In short order, she helps the man get onto Shade. She explains, "There's no horse that can keep up with us, and we have no time for waiting. By the way, what's your name?" And with that, she is off at full speed.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I gave him the ride of his life! Er."

"Oh. I'm Mathias Shaw," says the man. "Sorry, I was in a bit of a hurry. We've been looking for a lead on this 'Silk' character for months."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Shall we pose on through back to the Audacious?"

"Well, then maybe it's destiny, Mr. Shaw." With Shade carrying them, they are quickly back to the appointed pick-up site. Saeren draws back her weapon and fires into the air, the whistling of the passing dart signalling that she has returned. "I hope you can help us.. otherwise we may have to get very messy with those we've caught."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Annnd back on the ship."

> (OOC) Saeren sorries, has to do some things, will be idled for some time. :/

As Shaw is escorted into the interrogation room, he comes to a sudden stop as he looks at the captives. "_These_ are the assassins you captured?" he asks, grinning. "Well done. Oh, very well done." He cracks his knuckles, turning to face the pair, who glare back in unalloyed hatred. "I must congratulate you two, you know. You've been _very_ good at your job, you have. Such a shame that you bit off more than you could chew this time, isn't it?"

Kaliera says, "I suspect they did not think we would keep a watch while in the keep."

Shaw laughs. "Well, Marzon," he says, addressing one of the assassins in a soft voice, almost a whisper. "You got you information from 'Silk', I hear. Did you bother telling your erstwhile playmates what this 'Silk' looks like?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Shall I have Shaw continue the interrogation, or do you wish to assist?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "all I got is legbreaking, let's see what he can do"

The angry glares continue, and Shaw backs away, still smiling. "I see," he says. "Well, I know that our mutual friends here," he says, indicating the Covenant, "must've given you gentlemen some considerable incentive to give up even the codename." He paces around the room. "I don't see much in the way of equipment here, so it must've been improvised.

Saeren steps forward, "I can always cut off fingers and toes, if they need an education."

> (OOC) Saeren sneaks in for a moment.

Shaw grins. "You see?" he says, gesturing at Saeren while still looking the assassins in the eye. "Improvised. And amateurish, no offense meant, ma'am," he adds, nodding to Saeren. "But Marzon and Zoram here, they know that just _cutting off_ a finger or a toe hurts for a moment, and then it just kind of throbs. A more experienced interrogator-" Shaw begins, then shakes his head sadly. "But enough about that. I know you boys are eager to see how you fare with SI:7's hospitality, but I have a different proposal. Why don't you come in?"

The two assassins simultaneously spit at Shaw, who dodges easily. "Now, boys," he continues. "I'm not asking you to work _for_ Stormwind, exactly. Think of us as... the enemy of your enemy. I'm talking about the Bloodsails." He grins suddenly, as he looks into their eyes. "I take it you've heard of Plunder Isle, their home base? Of course you have. You have any idea where it is? Of course you don't." Shaw leans in close again. "I do."

There is no spittle this time. After a moment, one of them speaks. "What do you want?"

"Well, what Silk looks like, for starters," says Shaw. "I've got a little list of questions beyond that, which we can discuss back at SI:7," he says, presenting a slip of parchment for inspection. "But let's hear more about Silk, as a token of good faith." The two assassins study the parchment for a few moments. Finally, one nods. "He's an older man, balding, white hair. Big bushy moustache and a short beard. Lots of rings on his fingers. He's called 'Silk' because of what he's usually wearing when we meet him."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Sorry for the autopilot, folks. c.c"

The other assassin smirks. "I think you'll have a hard time arresting him though, Shaw. The likes of us won't be allowed as testimony against _him_."

"His legs break too," observes Sookie blandly.

Shaw leans back. "That's true, Sookie, but don't let anyone catch you doing it. Our friends here are insinuating that 'Silk' is of the nobility." Ames's mouth sets in a line. "They'd have full access to your records, wouldn't they?"

"Of course, sir," replies Ames grimly. "It's not like we'd say no, sir."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Any further commentary, or questions?"

Sookie thinks. This is harder than it sounds. "But you know if he asks for them? Whoever asked is suspicious, since we have assassins."

"Well, a lot of the noblemen are pretty nosy, ma'am," replies Ames. "But now that we have a description, we can talk to my men and narrow it down. I assume Shaw already has the machinery in motion." Shaw nods in affirmation.

> (OOC) Sookie got nothin else.

"If we can find a few names, I can likely get some evidence," says Saeren. Or plant some.

"Just one thing I don't understand," says Shaw, turning back to the assassins. "Why would _you_, of all people, work with someone like Silk?"

Kaliera reaches into her pouch and pulls out a large tome, the outer covers made of some kind of blued metal, with small white gems on the covers, and sits on a bed to leaf through it, looking thoughtful.

Marzon snorts. "Simple. He's selling out his buddies. He figures that once we take down the rest of the nobility, there'll be plenty left over for him. He gives us information on his rivals, we take 'em down, he's in place to pick up the pieces."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anything more for these guys?"

Kaliera finishes whatever she was looking up, and puts the book away.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "not for now."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "this is probably a good break spot anyway"

> (OOC) TidesGM nods. Anyone for a closing pose?

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "nope"

Kaliera says, "One more question for you gentlemen: what colors of silk does he wear?"

Marzon tilts his head, being too tightly bound for a shrug. "Different colors, but he favors mostly red, with some black and white.

Kaliera nods. "Thank you."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I think I'll rearrange that and put Sookie's at the end for the closer, if there's no objection."

Sookie sighs. Nothing has gone right for her, aside from rounding up the gang itself. This strange man got more out of the prisoners than the Twilight's Hammer and its legacy of pain. And friendly cooperation is still beyond her. Defeating Stormwind will take a lot more skill.
