# Turning Tides 2012-05-10

Shaw is going to handle the assassins. Benedict Ames seems innocent enough. That leaves the Defias, who were stumbling over themselves to give the party information once Sookie started breaking things. But their information wasn't that useful, and they're still scared. Taking note of her companion's attitude, Sookie approaches Kaliera. "Na, na. Got a question."

Kaliera looks up from her work - darning socks, actually - and nods. "Yes?"

"You seemed upset." The girl shrugs, staring away uncomfortably. "I got them to talk. Twilight's Hammer would have done more, not stopped once they started answering questions. But.. " She rubs a foot against the stonework of the _Audacious_ and its deck. "There's more than pain, yeah? Help me understand."

Kaliera sets her work aside. "There is pain, and there is doing it deliberately to cause fear. Perhaps it might be needed, but for my people, that is to be avoided if at all possible. During our war with the Orcs, sometimes.... sometimes they would take captives and do to them what you did. There were times it was for information. And times it was just for their amusement. And I am a healer, a priest, and part of my calling is to avoid and remedy pain." She takes a moment to think through her next words.

Kaliera says, "Sometimes there are ways to convince people to speak that do not require the inflicting of pain, the breaking of bodies. They can be spoken to, made to see other ways. And perhaps I could have found a spell to look into their minds for what we needed. Perhaps we should have planned better, first; I might have been able to come up with other ways. But I did not feel it proper, once things began, to object; that would have seemed weakness to them."

"That's what I don't understand," Sookie says. "I'm the strongest. They should listen." This argument seems so self-evident to her that no further elaboration seems forthcoming; it must be that everyone else just needs to be reminded of it.

Kaliera says, "Are you stronger than I? Could you have healed their broken bodies, or tended their souls if it had gone that far? Are you stronger than Kagarn, and his bond with the Earthmother? Or Saeren? Strength is measured in many ways, not just physical. I am gifted to see and becken for the help of the dead." For a moment, there's a shimmer, and the form of an orc, see-through and asleep on the floor, appears, then disappears. "But there are some who consider it strength to force their ghosts to do their will; I consider it strength to be able to ask their help without binding their souls."

Kaliera says, "...that is the strength of the Scourge and its masters, and I will not use it."

Sookie switches for a moment to Kalimag, mumbling under her breath. "Wind blows. Fire burns. Water flows. But fire's no good for thirst. Healing's no good for making men talk. But Shaw did it. He was.. like a trader, or merchant. How else do you make humans listen?"

Kaliera says, "You can appeal to their nature. He traded them information for information, appearing to the fact that their enemies are also ours. I could have tried to sway their hearts, preaching the nature of the Light to them in the hopes of illuminating them. hurting their bodies is, truly, transitory; to convince them to change their hearts, to change inside, brings them to being our allies."

While Kaliera speaks, Sookie has been gingerly tapping the floor with her foot, feeling for the briefly-glimpsed orc. She stares down curiously and sounds distracted when she answers. "Don't know any light. Don't think the Defias care either. But their enemy is mine. It's Stormwind, just not... just not.." Sookie struggles a moment. "Not the same Stormwind. It's.. like shadows on a wall."

Kaliera says, "They told you about Stormwind. You are finding that what they told you is not entirely true... but there is still some truth in it." She considers for a moment. "They told you what they needed you to hear and know so you would be their weapon. But you have found a greater strength than winds and earth: the strength of your spirit to admit that it may not be as you were told. Some struggle their lives to admit that there might be something they fail to completely understand."

"I don't understand anything." Sookie scowls, and looks up. "The Lady said there's something in Stormwind to be destroyed. Not the keep. It..." Revelation dawns, a light that's almost literally visible on the girl's face. "Hearts. Like you say. Bad hearts. That's what I'm to defeat."

Kaliera says, simply, "Yes."
