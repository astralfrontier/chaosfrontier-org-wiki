Garn and Nurg have taken a break from their teaching and learning. They approach Sookie, hands on axes, looking unhappy.

"This isn't what we were promised," growls Nurg in Orcish. "Yeah. Training humans, meditating, and listening to water," adds Garn. "We're soldiers."

"When does the war start? What good is shamanism?" demands Nurg.

"Three spirits came to me today," Sookie answers.

---

The first was a spirit of the deep ocean. "I come to Kagarn Stormhoof, shaman of the Earthen Ring," it spoke in Kalimag, the ancient tongue of all such beings. And when it had delivered its message from his fellows in the Earthen Ring, conveying news from Kalimdor, it spoke to Sookie. "Ask me one favor, child of the elements, for you are favored by your master."

"Teach me of the pulling underwater, of the hands of the tides which cannot be escaped by any cunning," Sookie answered. And so the spirit taught her the hands of the tide which pull the unwary under the surface and do not release them until they drown.

Sookie demonstrates this to Garn and Nurg, grappling both by the arm, and holding them in a painful lock from which there is no escape. And both orcs at last submit.

The second spirit was the blowing wind which whistled around SI:7 headquarters. "I come to Kagarn Stormhoof, shaman of the Earthen Ring," it whispered in Kalimag, the subtle tongue of all such beings. And when it had delivered its message of the secret goings-on within the domain of Stormwind's spymaster, it spoke to Sookie. "Ask me one favor, child of the elements, for you are favored by your master."

"Teach me of the wind which blows and cannot be heard, of the wind that whistles over cats' whiskers and speaks to them of hidden foes," Sookie answered. And so the spirit taught her the blowing of the breeze and how to feel the motion of one's enemies and hide one's motion from their ears.

Sookie demonstrates this to Garn and Nurg, blindfolding herself and expertly parrying their axes with her watery blades. And both orcs at last see the truth of it.

The third spirit was an ancestor of the Tauren, one who had traveled far to the Eastern Kingdoms before the Sundering broke the world. Here the shu'halo came to hunt Apa'ro, called Malorne by the night elves, and here they died with the hunt incomplete. "I come to Kagarn Stormhoof, shaman of the Earthen Ring," it announced in Taur-ahe, the native tongue of all Tauren. But Sookie understood, for it had come in a dream brought on by the incense and odors which Kagarn used. And when the ancestor had commanded Kagarn to obey the wishes of his ancestors, and spoke many secret things with the bull-shaman, it spoke to Sookie. "Ask me one favor, human, for you are as a child to him who is a child to me."

"To be like Saeren Moon-mother I wished for watery weapons, to be like Nerai Jointrust I have wished for mercy, to be like the Lady I have wished for followers to serve me and be protected. To be like _goshi_, I wish for the wisdom of the spirit world," Sookie answered. And the ancestor taught her the ways of calling on the spirits, not as a spirit herself, but as a shaman and protector of her people.

Sookie demonstrates this by conjuring rain, and Garn and Nurg understand at last.

"Shaman is the nobleman, like a human lord," she explains. "To serve the ancestors and the elements as a soldier in wartime, a healer in peacetime. To be strong and wise. It is what my old handler Hurragh wished me to be. Join me, brothers, and let us seek victory together as students of the spirits." And the orcs have no further complaint.
