Moonbrook itself is easily enough scouted out - the Defias are amateurs compared to an experienced sentinel of Kalimdor. The town is covered with regular patrols, sentries on watchtowers, and a smattering of mages to provide heavy firepower. The chapel, inn, and outbuildings are used as stockpiles for armaments and tinker parts, the latter used in the mechanical scarecrows that plague Westfall's fields.

The huge barn at the south end of town, according to the Defias traitors, houses the secret entrance into the Deadmines. Closer inspection on the ground bears this out - the amount of foot traffic in and out of the barn far exceeds any ordinary storge site. Though Saeren herself may be able to infiltrate this chokepoint, the rest of the party would have no choice but to fight their way in, thus alerting the rest of the mines.

Accordingly, the Covenant decides to repeat the method that proved so successful at Stonewatch: when the front door is too heavily guarded, make your own entrance in the back. Unlike Stonewatch, though, there is no way to guess where the Deadmines might run. This is where Kaliera's spirit allies come in. Empowered with Kagarn's elemental magic, they will infitrate the mines, unseen and immaterial, and will find a suitable point behind the Defias defenses.

Kaliera sits, eyes closed, focusing on her allies: amongst them, a dwarf who forgets often that he's dead, an orc seeking honor to redeem himself in death, a gnome mage, and the Marshal. To help sustain them, she focuses on them to the exclusion of the world around her, except for one thing: she lets them speak to the others through her.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "While Kaliera's ghosts are poking around inside, Saeren will be watching for Defias patrol sweeps."

Fiddlesticks! comes the squeaky tones of the gnome, "the front door's warded!" "Then we should go around," comes the gutteral voice of the orc. A few moments pass, and then the dwarf's voice is heard. "Och, this stone's terrible... wait, I'm dead, I can go through this." Discussions come through as the spirits talk amongst themselves, until the Marshal's voice overrides: "Blasted goblins. And all this wood. What are they making?"

> (OOC) Saeren poses her job :)

There's a brief discussion, then the crew keeps going. References to forges, including the place where the scarecrows are apparently made, come forth, including a discussion about a strange device, like a more powerful scarecrow, come through. Finally, there's a pause in the discussion, and the dwarf's voice comes from Kaliera's mouth: "...that's the biggest bloody ship I've ever seen." And the gnome: "...and I think some of those casters might be able to see us!"

While Kaliera works with her ghostly allies, Saeren ensures that no one else dies today. She is shadowing the patrols of the enemy, keeping an eye on what they see and distracting them when needed. A nigh universal truth is that patrols will hunt if given a chance. Saeren uses her own tracking skills, along with Shade's impressive nose, to scare up some game, leading one patrol to leave its route completely in the search of a fresh meal.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I didn't really have more on that vein. :)"

The Marshal takes over the discussion. "There's a rock wall up there. Let's go around. If Sookie breaks through just under the waterline, it's a short swim to the dreadnought." There's a brief pause, and then the Marshal speaks once again, through Kaliera: "We're in position. Have Sookie come through from the west of here."

"They've gone a long way away," responds Sookie. "This way." A brief whisper into a talkbox - a relic left the party by Nerai before she departed - and Saeren is called back in to take point as the Covenant makes their way around the Dagger Hills to the shore of the Great Sea, with the shores of Stranglethorn Vale dimly visible in the distance.

Sookie raises her hand toward the ocean, and her eyes glow a lambent blue as she calls up on the power of the waves that has shaped these coasts for millenia. A column of swirling water rises from the waves and plunges into the rockface before them, doing the work of a century in mere minutes, just as the river had done to the foundations of Stonewatch.

Kaliera mumbles in the midst of her trance, with the dwarf's voice. "Och, what manner of wizardry is this!" The Marshal, who was prepared for the manifestation, is more businesslike. "Down a little further, please. We want the tunnel to come out below the waterline." Sookie nods almost mechanically, and gestures subtly.

Moments later, the water withdraws and subsides, falling back into the ocean with a splash masked by the crash of surf. The secret entrance to the Defias' inner sanctum is ready.

The party, on the other hand, is not quite so ready. Sookie is wearied from the effort of tunneling, and Kaliera from granting the spirits their manifestation. "Let us enter the mouth of the tunnel, and rest there," says Kagarn. "Saeren, help me devise a way to conceal this entrance from prying eyes."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "This would be Saeren using the Camouflage skill to cloak the tunnel entrance, with Kagarn supplying Shape Earth to make it go more quickly. If you can think of anything to pose here, it'd be welcome. Other than that, you can do a few poses scouting out the dreadnought as best you can. The guards here are sharper-eyed, but the only "intruders" they expect are Defias who aren't cleared for this."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Actually... Saeren, you can pose capturing one of the sentries. People here will know who is being guarded here, and where."

> (OOC) TidesGM checks on folks.

> (OOC) Kaliera lives

> (OOC) TidesGM hm. we seem to have a Father's Day outage.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "If sumi can't get back by 5:30 PDT (in 15 minutes or so), I'll go ahead and wrap logs and we'll pick up from this point in two weeks."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "If she /does/ get back, we can have her pose capturing a centry and we'll pick up from THAT point in two weeks. :)"

> (OOC) Saeren has disconnected.

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "question: answered"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All right, here we go!"

Saeren directs Kagarn's efforts, making careful use of the tailings from Sookie's excavation and overhanging vegetation to carefully conceal the tunnel entrance. To complete the disguise, Kagarn actually fills in part of the hole behind them with loosely packed dirt - a plug that allows air and light to pass, and that could easily be cleared away with a swift punch or a body blow, should they need to leave in a hurry.

With their entry point secure, the Covenant continues onward, into the underground cove beneath the Dagger Hills, where the leadership of the Defias await, unaware - for now - that the forces of justice have breached their sanctum.

Having shielded against patrols, it now falls to Saeren to purposely find a sentry, draw him away, and bring him back for questioning. At least that was the original plan. However, as it turns out, the first promising prospect is actually not a he, but a she. To the night elf, it doesn't change matters much.

The target is young, but carries herself with confidence. Both promising points. Younger generally implies easier to break. The confidence hints at importance, especially when the sentry has a cocky air in front of other Defias. The prospect is even more convenient. Having learned how the area is patrolled, Saeren is able to predict the course of the young woman and knows that it is ideal. A long patrol.

With Shade to serve as the bearer, Saeren's task is simply this: hit hard, but do not kill. Knowing that others can patch up any overly energetic attempts to subdue, Saeren is quite confident. She just has to ensure she doesn't kill the girl or draw attention.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sorry, spouse was hitting the keys there, I'm not able to do this right now. The baby is too small to spare me for any amount of time. I want to play, but I'm going to have to take some time away."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All right. Well, shall we wrap here and try for next time?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "ok"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'll come back and explain what that looks like sometime soon, probably next weekend. Sorry to drop this suddenly, but I can't manage both without putting unfair stress on my family. Which is what I did tonight. I'll talk to you guys later."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Take care!"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sorry about it, I've been kind of a jerk to my spouse tonight. I'll see you later."
