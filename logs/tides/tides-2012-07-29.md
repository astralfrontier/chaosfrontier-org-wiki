> (OOC) TidesGM will pull Saeren strings as needed to keep moving. Unfortunately, I've lacked the motivation to pull together a proper combat, which I'd originally intended, but I'll try to make it up as best I can.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "that's fine."

> (OOC) Kaliera has connected.

Saeren emerges from the tunnel, dripping wet, and carrying a likewise drenched woman bearing the telltale scarlet mask of the Defias. "Kagarn or Kaliera, if you will?" she says, gently laying the captive on the stony floor. "She will eventually recover on her own, but we don't have much time before she is missed."

Kaliera nods, kneeling next to the woman and channeling the Light through the priestess's body into the half-drowned woman.

The woman responds quickly to the priestess's ministrations, eyes flying open in alarm. "Wha- who are you? How did you get down here-" The frantic eyes dart round. "Where am I!" she demands, struggling against the rope binding her wrists.

Sookie frowns. She hasn't had the best success with interrogation lately. Instead of speaking, she gestures briefly to Kaliera and waits to see how the draenei does.

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "what's the goal here? I'm blanking."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "locate the leadership of the Defias here in the Deadmines."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "aah, my cunning plan might work then!"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "with intent to kidnap and flee through our improvised entrance"

Kaliera says, "You are outside. There was a cave-in, and you were trapped underwater. We were travelling to Stranglethorn Vale when we heard the collapse. Thankfully, we were able to find you and pull you out. We need to know where more are, so we can continue the rescue effort! That tunnel - we found it and brought you through it, how can we find others to rescue?" She affects an urgent demeanor of someone whose only goal is to help."

The woman is bewildered. "Cave-in? What are you talking about? Why am I still tied up?" She tugs at her wrists, trying to look round at her back.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I hope you roll a 3 on Fast-Talk here"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "I was hoping for confusion. Darn my own healing."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Confusion is still in effect. You could still salvage the Fast Talk role by untying her if you like."

Kaliera goes to (seem to) untie the rope. "We bound your wrists to get you out faster - your arms were moving around and it looked like you might break something - but we need to help others! How do we find them?"

"There better be a lot more of you to help than this!" says the woman, picking up on the urgency. "Unless the boat survived the cave-in - that's probably our best hope, it's pretty sturdy, but... oh damn! His quarters are right up at the top! He'll be crushed! Him _and_ the kids!"

Kaliera's sudden sense of urgency is not faked now - if anything, she's holding back. "Tell us the fastest way to get to him from where you were! If there's children, we must make that a priority!" (some of these might decide to take hostages, after all.) The ropes start to slacken on the woman's arms.

The Defias sentry shakes his head as if to clear it. "I'm... I'm not sure where I was on the route... but there's a scaffolding up by one side of the boat. They haven't finished the stairwells inside, so-" The woman gasps. "All those guards on the scaffold... by the Light... you've got to let me help you!"

Sookie has an idea, and leans in to whisper something in Kaliera's ear.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Saeren knows what scaffold the woman is talking about, as do Kaliera's ghosts. It was indeed crawling with guards, and had there /been/ a cave-in, they'd be in real trouble."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "How far away are our Defias?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "The guys you've converted so far, Sookie's army? Last I recall, you'd left them in the airship."

> (OOC) Kaliera nods

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Think of this as their first real test of loyalty."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "If they stay bought even with one of their own around, and no supervision from me, I'm happy"

Kaliera says, "You can help us," finishing untying the wrists, "by heading up the road a bit. We have more people with us - run and tell them we sent you, in the airship nearby. They can come and help us, now that we have your help! Tell them what you told us and that we said to take you in. Go, run! The faster you go the faster we can help the others!"

The woman nods shortly, and heads up the tunnel. There is the sound of rattling earth as she breaks through the dirt plug concealing the entrance, then the brief sound of footsteps as she makes her way along the cliffside road.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "You guys doing anything other than waiting to see what comes of this?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I think we should head in directly without waiting."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "agreed."

Without waiting to see what comes of her errand, the Covenant makes their way further down the tunnel. Bobbing their heads just above the waterline, they can see the torchlit cavern, the shell of the mighty but incomplete dreadnought, and the scaffold, crawling with guards, on its near side. There is the faintest of splashes as Saeren vaults from the water, but by the time the others turn around, there is no sign of her passage but a pair of damp footprints on the rock.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "we should ascend on the far side, where there's presumably no scaffold"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "no need to mess around with guards"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "indeed."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "need anything from us, GM?"

Kagarn mutters a brief orison to the spirits of water, and the rest of the Covenant proceeds beneath the surface, emerging on the far side of the great ship. This side is complete, and although there are a few guards on deck, the sheer height of the vessel is - at least according to the masterminds of the Defias - all the protection against assault that is needed.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Take it away, folks. Assume that you have proper sniper support; Saeren is still under orders to use non-lethal means wherever possible."

> (OOC) Sookie poses a setup then.

While Saeren climbs to a rocky outcropping with her bow, Sookie solves the problem of the dreadnought's height her own way. The water around herself, Kaliera and Kagarn begins to rise - with them still swimming in it. Silently, the water bubble ascends to the deck, and Sookie steps out of it first and onto the wood. Keeping the water levitated seems to be straining her concentration, but not badly enough that her friends risk falling.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Guards will, naturally, take note of a magically rising water bubble, and call for help if given a chance. There aren't many mages on this side (yet), but those that do observe would try to dispel the magic supporting it."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "this is where IQ-based Stealth rolls come in, if you felt like it, to let us find the best time to ascend."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "but Sookie's going to return the water once we're up"

Normally, the guards would have noticed something like a bubble of water rising from the lake inside the cove. Normally, even on the blind side of the ship, there would have been enough pairs of eyes that at least one would have been watching. But then, normally there would not have been a clattering-splashing sound on the far side of the deck, drawing attention upward and away from the water's edge, as Saeren launches a distracting shot across the bow. Nor would there be anything to raise the alarm in that shot - by the time the guards found the spot, the arrow shaft would have already dissolved back into water and left no more than an inexplicable puddle.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "You have moments to deal with about two or three guards before they look down again and spot you. None are mages."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Choke Hold + drowning! That's good for any 2"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Sounds good - pose it. Assume a well-timed blunt bolt from Saeren takes care of the third, and pose that as well if you like."

Kaliera begins to channel the power of the Light, its power to bring dreams in the darkness of sleep. ((or in other words, prepare a sleep spell if needed ))

Sookie lets the water drain out as quickly as possible. She spots two of the Defias men, and grabs hold of them by the neck from a distance. A pair of quiet splashes mark their dunking in the water, and the end of their thrashing signals unconsciousness. Carefully she lets them bob to the surface, then looks around for others before draping them over rocks on the far shore.

A third guard has just enough time to see one of his companions go over the edge before a blunt water-arrow strikes him between the eyes and and he slumps to the deck. No alarm has been raised, and the Covenant looks up at three stories' worth of dreadnought between them and their quarry.

> (OOC) Sookie can keep lifting people up

Kaliera holds the power, in case someone else needs a short nap.

The elements take hold again, this time of Sookie and her friends, and they slowly rise up the side of the vessel, keeping close to the bulkhead to avoid the notice of any guards at the top who might happen to look down. As they peek over the upper deck, they can see at least a dozen Defias. This far up, no one seriously believes anyone could get this far without the alarm being raised, so only the two Defias standing guard on either side of the wheelhouse seem truly alert.

Sookie glances at Kaliera, then Kagarn, pointing first at herself, then the Defias guards, then making a quick jerking gesture over the rail.

Kaliera nods.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "okay. we're gonna sneak into position, then start lobbing guards over the rail as fast as possible."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "If any of them seem to be harder to toss I'm going to try to sleep them"

Sookie also signals for Saeren's benefit, gesturing at the spot where the scaffold meets the ship and making a cutting gesture across the throat: _Keep people from coming up on deck_.

Even as Sookie vaults the rail, the two guards on the wheelhouse keel over, water splashing on the side of their heads. The nearby Defias turn to watch, slowly, too slowly - except for one who is already heading backward over the rail with a surprised look on his face.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Pose onward! I'll be rolling to see if /anyone/ recovers from mental stun in time to raise the alarm."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "okay. with surprise, and All-Out Attack, each attack I have can grapple two guys. So I can move 4 guys off the deck every 2 seconds."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "even doing it that way, effective ST is 17. good luck breaking free."

Before any of the guards can process it, a third of their number are simply seized by some powerful invisible force, and flung off the side of the ship. Stealth is over; Sookie doesn't care about stifling the screams they'll make, only that they don't necessarily fall to their death on rocks. And as the others try to orient on the source of the attack, she grabs more.

Saeren is playing her part as well - the next two men to fall to watery arrows are the only ones dressed in ornately decorated scarlet robes. Another whirls at the sound of his allies' muffled cries, and has time to say "Hey you!" and raise his crossbow...

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "I do have a readied spell to throw."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Pose eet. n.n Rolling is more or less optional."

Kaliera gestures, and the spell comes forth, trying to convince the crossbow-wielder to lay down, to rest, to sleep...

> (OOC) Kaliera was!

"What..." is about all the man can manage to drawl out before his eyes roll up in his head and the Light lays him down to rest on the deck. Meanwhile, two more of his friends go sailing past. In the space of less than five seconds, the Covenant are the only ones still upright and on deck, and into the wheelhouse before someone on the scaffold below even has time to say, "Hey! What's going on up there?"

"They're in the water!" Sookie calls, hoping that everyone else who could give the proper response is currently clawing their way to the surface for air. "They're trying to escape!"

But whatever is occurring on deck is of secondary importance to the Covenant as they rush past the wheel and the binnacle to the captain's quarters beyond. The first two people they see could only barely be called 'kids' - the boy is about Sookie's age, and the girl must be at least thirteen. And by Sookie's ear, she hears the creak of a floorboard and is face to face with a gruff-looking man in a red bandana.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Eddie rolled a 17 for Stealth, swear to god."

> (OOC) Sookie o.o b

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "What Do You Do?"

> (OOC) Sookie kicks in unless Kaliera has a plan here

> (OOC) Kaliera lets Sookie go

> (OOC) Sookie says, "if you love someone's plan, set them free. if it doesn't work, that way they'll be out of range of you when it fails"

This is it. "Edwin VanCleef," announces Sookie brashly. "Come with me. We're going to defeat Stormwind. No resist, or we fight and take you anyway."

The only answer van Cleef gives is a barked "Fool!" and a spirited attempt to disembowel Sookie with a dagger.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Roll to defend."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Unless that's not how we do it..."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "That will do fine!"

Sookie reckoned he'd try to do it the hard way. She was ready. Water arcs in a rainbow-laden spray from her hands in a flash, taking the form of twin weapons as big as any greatsword, and graceful as any rapier.

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 9 (3 5 1) vs. 17, succeeding by 8

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Aggressive parry. his weapon takes 4d"

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 4d for 16 (3 3 5 5) damage

> (OOC) Sookie says, "knives are DR 2 HP 8, that'll easily eat through whatever he swung"

The dagger shatters in the grip of the twin water-blades with an ear-splitting crack. He glares at the girl before him. "Damn you!" he says, his hands already coming up as he attempts to close in.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "But it's your turn."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "other compartment gets its action at the same time. Choke hold."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "deceptive grapple, -3 to defend"

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 16 (5 5 6) vs. 16, succeeding by 0

> (OOC) Sookie says, "over and above his other penalties for this attack..."

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 12 (6 4 2) vs. 6, failing by 6

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "If it'd have been close, I might've fiddled the numbers after the fact. It wasn't close. YOu have him."

As Sookie's control of the storm seizes the man in a choking hold, she looks sternly at the children. "You come too. Father will need you. No more stupid attacks, though."

"Father!" shouts the girl, as she flings a dagger straight at Sookie, only to have hit batted away at the last moment by an expertly wielded blade. "Let him go!" says the older boy, drawing a remarkably steady rapier and advancing on the Covenant.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I can keep the blades up and still keep him in a choke. I'll let the rapier attack, and cross parry to break it"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "so compartment 2 maintains the grapple, compartment 1 is All-Out Defense"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "however, Edwin is losing 1 FP per turn, so he'll be out in 10-20 seconds..."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "the Quick Contest to break free is 32 vs. his ST or HT, I wish him luck."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Kaliera? you prepping any more Sleep spells?"

> (OOC) Kaliera is, yes. hm. The boy, I think, first.

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 8 (1 3 4) vs. 11, succeeding by 3

Kaliera says, "We have not killed anyone. Everyone lives."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Successful attack against Sookie. Parry, please."

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 11 (2 3 6) vs. 17, succeeding by 6

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 4d for 14 (5 2 6 1)

> (OOC) Sookie says, "that'll probably break a fencing weapon unless it's really good quality. but this is a cross parry, which means both blades..."

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 4d for 19 (5 4 6 4)

The young lad squares up in a fencing stance, and stabs swiftly for Sookie's face, only to have the blade caught between both of Sookie's. He brings back the stump of the blade and blinks at it in bewildered confusion.

"No more stupid attacks," Sookie reminds him with a dazzling smile.

"Let Dad go-" screams the girl, but the boy raises a hand. "Easy, Vanessa. These people are too much for us. Don't worry - all of the Defias will be out to get us back. They won't get away with this."

"Then come with us." Sookie gestures to the water. "Follow your father. Everyone will be safe. Okay?"

The lad drops his weapon, and blinks at Sookie, seeming to _look_ at her for the first time, and blushes to the roots of his hair. "O-okay," he stutters, and is elbowed by his younger sister. "Stop staring, you big buffoon. She's the enemy, 'member?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All right, let's take it away. You guys should pose through bulling through the handful of Defias from belowdecks who are milling around in confusion, and will become unconfused real quickly when they see who you've got."

> (OOC) Sookie will make this short then?

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Should be pretty quick. YOu just have to get your captives across a few feet of deck and into the water."

Kaliera's magic, Kagarn's bulk, Sookie's eldritch power, and Saeren's arrows carve a channel out of any Defias with enough presence of mind to muster a ranged attack. The rest aren't a concern - the Covenant's forces dive straight for the water. Sookie lowers the unconscious Edwin, and stays up long enough to make sure his children go with him. Then she dives for it.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "unless there's complications, please just pose us back to HQ. I want to see what our recruits make of this development, assuming we still have some"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "hopefully!"

Some of the Defias try to dive into the water after them, but their efforts are too little, too late - and in any case, the few that try quickly learn that Saeren's war-wave, being of the element of water, can fire _into_ water in a way that conventional bows cannot. The Covenant emerges from the tunnel entrance, captives in tow, and Saeren follows shortly after, with Kagarn collapsing the entrance behind her.

Turning around, they find Morgaine with a small band behind her. "We heard there was a 'cave-in'," she says, with a smile and heavy sarcasm, "and we're here to 'help with the rescue efforts'." The smile melts away as she sees the face of their captive. "Edwin van Cleef! You've captured _him_?

"Recruitment hampered by arrows, knives and such," explains Sookie. "Need to work on him here. Everyone okay?"

Morgaine seems flustered, and there is mumbling in the ranks - not of revolt, but of sheer astonishment. "Y-yeah, we're fine. The sentry is being held securely aboard the Audacious, to be treated for her injuries, we told her..." Wide-eyed, she looks at the Defias leader and the children again. "Y... what are you going to do with him?"

"Recruit him," repeats Sookie. "To defeat Stormwind."

Morgaine blinks. "You keep talking about that, but I'm still not sure I understand _how_ you intend to defeat Stormwind..."

Sookie grins. "Well sure. Defias didn't understand the right way to do it. That's why you haven't done it yet. Listen in when I talk to Edwin. You'll see."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "And... that's a wrap, folks!"
