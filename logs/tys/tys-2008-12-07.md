# University of Tys 2008-12-07

Spring has finally come to the Duchy after a long, harsh winter. Frost is no longer seen on the window panes, though a few chunks of glaciation are still floating lazily down the aptly-named Ice River.

With the return of Spring, comes the return of the expeditions from the southern continents. The specific dates can't be predicted of course, so there's always a hue and cry from the docks and the banking houses of the Great Square when an incoming ship is spotted.

One such ship is the _Spaniel_, a three-masted sailing ship of the Duchy's Navy. It's common practice for the Duchy to send scientific observers and other scholars from its university on naval expeditions; and so it is that a messenger, his horse puffing steam in the chill air, comes to the University gates bearing news for the chancellor: "We have returned. Send porters. We have much to see."

In the week-long break between classes, few students are still about; many are at home helping prepare the farms for planting. And so the Librarian, Cavell, drafts those he can find, to accompany him to the Docks.

36 is an easy choice when it comes to moving things. He's always agreeable and he's immensely strong, certainly moreso than a typical student. And so his brass struts and molded white limbs carry him slowly but surely down toward the docks.

Wulfgang is to be found in his room, lazing about his bed, waiting for something fun to spring up. Of course, this isn't exactly what Wulfgang was thining of as fun. In any case, he is thusly recruited, following the messenger to the gathering place ouside of the University, ready to treck to the docks.

Gerald has been fascinated with 36, and so finding the mechanical wonder, more often than not, means finding Gerald. The lad is a helpful sort anyway, though, so he doesn't make too much effort to shirk his duty.

Cavell rolls up a moment later, with a battered cart drawn by two horses. While the University is quite wealthy, the cart may date back to old Lord Tys himself, who founded the place 99 years ago. Cavell nods silently; he's quiet, even for a librarian. The students pile aboard, helping 36 over the awkward step, and the cart rolls on.

Wulfgang waves to the other two here-to unknown folk aboard the card. "Heya guys." He smiles, proffering her hand to 36, "I'm Wulfgang." He has a huge beaming smile across his face.

36 clicks his fingers together, looking at them, then at Wulfgang's hand. After a moment he extends his own as well.

Gerald extends his hand. "Gerald. Pleased to meet you."

Wulfgang takes the mechanical man's hand, after a few moments of consideration. "Nice to meet ya." A hearty handshake is proffered to Gerald too.

The cart clatters on towards the city, First, a mile down the road from the University to Highgate, and then straight south down Highgate Avenue towards the docks. Highgate is lined with old and expensive buildings of brick and stone; the homes of the wealthy and powerful. The Avenue ends at the Great Square, where most of them work. The Square is enormous, easily a hundred yards in both directions, and lined with the houses of government and commerce. The city is bustling even on this chill morning; the carts from the farms stream out to the north, as the workday starts for the clerks and bankers. The docks and wharfs, with their tall ships and high cranes, are visible from the southern edge of the Square. Eighteen ships are visible in the harbor; not all that many, for the City, but enough for late March.

Five miles from Highgate, the cart arrives at the wharfs. There's a tangle of wagons, cranes, draft animals, and longshoremen that drive the activity here. Cavell pulls up to a gate and hands a small pile of coins to a clerk, who hands back an officious-locking document: permit to enter. A boy no older than Wulfgang or Gerald comes out of a hut and takes hold of the bridle on one of the horses, leading you by hand to the wharf where the Spaniel has docked.

The Spaniel is a medium vessel, as the oceans of the World go. Two hundred feet long and with three masts about as high, she'll tough and speedy. Her sailors have already swarmed ashore, leaving a small party by the gangway to greet Cavell.

Cavell hops down and waves at the boys to do the same. He grins, still silent, and walks up to one of the men, tall and somewhat sunburned, oddly so for the current climate. He gives him a firm handshake and a claps him on the shoulder. "Professor Fredric," is all he says.

Fredric grins, and answers. "Cavell. Talkative as always. And some students as well, I see. And... your mechanical friend." He waves to Gerald and Wulfgang, and somewhat less certainly at 36. "Well. Let's get to work.

A crane has unloaded dozens of large crates from the hold of the ship; some are fixed with the university crest... there's far more than will fit in the cart. It might weigh ten tons or more. Fortunately, Fredric has arranged for teamsters to move it all that the University grounds. His personal effects, on the other hand...

He leads you to the cabin that he shared with the ship's doctor, and there's six large carpet bags, a steamer trunk, and several piles of books bound with twine. Cavell picks up Fredric's umbrella, looks at the rest, and then looks at you expectantly.

Wulfgang shrugs, and waves to the Professor. "Heya, sir." He smiles, and gets to work hauling some of the bags.

Fredric, somewhat more graciously than Cavell, picks up two of his own bags, and the others prove to be no great hassle. Even 36, juggling a pile of books, maps, and charts against the gentle rocking of the ship, clears the gangway and ascends to the cart. Cavell and Fredric have already taken positions on front bench, and the same boy leads the cart away from the docks.

There's less traffic on Highgate Avenue on the way back. Frost only remains on the ground in the shadows of the larger buildings, and a faint steam leaks up between the cobblestones. Fredric and Cavell are both silent until you are past the Great Square, then the professor turns back and addresses you. "Well. Lovely to chat with Cavell, but perhaps we should give our juniors an opportunity to speak. It's the Thawing Week now, isn't it? What leaves you all at the University, instead of at home for the Festival?"

Wulfgang shrugs, "My parents boarded a pleasure ship to sail around the seas." He beams, "I'm jsut hanging around to catch all the thaw parties, yeah?" He smiles at the professor, allowing the others time to interject before continuing.

36 keeps moving, his gears and pullies whining noisily as he propels himself. His head wobbles as it turns to look from Wulfgang to Fredric and back.

Gerald shrugs. "I've been taking advantage of some free time to study ol' 36 here. The machinery is amazingly ingenious. Though I still have no idea what sort of being he is. All this 'spiritual water' business... it's not an _explanation_."

36 wobbles a bit, and turns to watch Gerald curiously.

Wulfgang looks to Gerald. "Why not? You don't think the smarts are in the gears themselves, yeah?" He smiles, "Of coruse there's something else out there beyond steam that we just don't know...." He trails off, almost not talking to anyone anymore..

36's head precesses back to stare at Wulfgang, tilting slightly. Of course he still continues to lug the numerous personal effects.

Fredric grins. "Shamanism's not my strong suit, either. Got your own theory, then, Master Gerald?" He takes notice of 36, still entangled in a pile of carpet bags. "Or we could just ask. What brings you here, 36? In the broad sense of the question."

36's brass gearings whine from under the forged steel of his hull. "Zzazked to haul cargo from zzhip," he answers in a tinny, modulated voice.

Fredric chuckles. "There's a group of monks we met that he'd... that't you'd fit in well with, 36. 'Why are we here? Because we're here.'

Wulfgang looks to 36. "There's an answer for you..." He shrugs, and his uterly chaotic mind leaps back to something else he thought of, his arm moves in an expansive gesture, ending on a nondescript wooden crate, "So, what did you pick up on your journet, Professor?"

"Yeah. Like, what's this?" asks Gerald more directly, tapping the wooden box.

Fredric frowns. "A geode... I think. It's a real oddity. Hey, I don't suppose either of you is good with geology? Or that Professor Chapell is around? No, he's out on the _Lynx._ Well. Why don't you meet me in the geology building tomorrow - it's still there, yes? Good. We can try to find out."

"All right," says Gerald. "Geology isn't really my thing, but I'm curious." He peers at Fredric, amidst his frequent glances back at the box. "Just as long as we aren't gonna break it."

Fredric thinks it over for a moment. "The real problem with geodes," he says slowly, "is that the most interesting features are on the interior. But... well. We'll have to see. The ship didn't have facilities for such work."

---

The geology lab is also shared with the other departments and is more of a general workshop for classes and experiments. The room is full of expensive granite-topped tables and movable wooden partitions to give a sembelance of privacy. During the holiday week, it's not used much. The clock is striking 10 when Fredric arrives in the lab the next morning, looking a little less bedraggled than the day before. "Ah a real bed, after all that time at sea... now then." He puts the wooden box on a bench. "Let's see what's in here."

He removes the top to reveal a large, round rock, cushioned by a pile of straw. He removes the rock carefully and places it on a scale. The thing is six inches across, but seems to weigh only about a pound. "This is the thing. It's light. Very light. And I'd suspect, hollow. But it's also... very tough. Not in itself remarkable. So why do we keep wanting to pay attention to it?"

36's gyroscopics whine as his head tilts back and forth, studying it. He reaches out with a manipulator and takes hold of some of the straw, holding it up for closer inspection.

The straw, though damp and smelling faintly of salt, appears to be dry and charred in places, like it spent a long time in contact with something quite hot.

Closer inspection shows that only the layer in direct contact with the stone is so charred. The pattern looks like a negative image of the surface of the rock.

Wulfgang reaches his hand out, placing it over the orb without touching it, feeling the air around it to see if he feels any vibrations or heat from the object, looking to 36's inspection of the straw.

The orb, whatever it was doing before, seems inert now. Fredric is sorting through a pile of lab tools, doing something with what might be a very small-bore drill.

Gerald frowns, peering at a burned wisp of straw. "Y'know, something weird, but..." he begins, then shakes his head. "Never mind. It's probably my imagination."

Wulfgang looks over at Gerald. "Yes?" He looks down. "An odd, strangely light orb? Maybe it's an egg of some sort...." He looks at the straw, "That would be consistant with it getting hot, anyway."

"No, it's not that," says Gerald. "It's just that I keep thinking the thing is _watching_ me. Silly as that sounds."

"An egg?" Fredric says, stopping his search. "Perhaps. But... I've never heard of something that uses stones for eggs." He seems to notice something, and sounds a little alarmed. "What do you mean, getting hot?"

The sphere suddenly rattles on the desktop, as if it had been pushed... but Wulfgang removed his hand a full second before.

The sphere rattles more violently. A narrow crack appears in the side, three inches long and the width of a hair.

36 stops moving. The whirring noise he normally makes has subsided, and only the rhythmic clacking of gears can be heard inside his hull.

"Zzsun.... sunrise," the mechanical contraption says after a moment. "W-waiting for.. sunrise. Sleeping."

"It's alive!" declares Gerald in astonishment. "It _is_ an egg - and it's hatching!" He glances at 36, and reaches for it. "Let's take it outside, then! If it's waiting for sunrise..."

36 buzzes back to life, as his joints and pulleys fulley engage. "I will.. perform Laudzz," he announces.

Fredric has the presence of mind to get a set of tongs, and is a little overwhelmed the young students' reaction, to say nothing of 36's. "Hey! You should... hatching into what?" he finishes weakly; but by then, 36 has the egg, and Wulfgang and Gerald are right behind him. Metallic footsteps clatter out the door and down the hall.

---

At 10am, some of the campus buildings cast long shadows; but the sundial in the center of the quad is always exposed, and it is here that 36 brings the 'egg'. The crack has lengthened to half the diameter of the specimen, and all three of you feel like something - who knows what - is alive inside.

Outside, 36 is quietly reciting Terce - the mid-morning prayers.

With a loud snapping noise, familiar to anyone who's been around a potter's kiln on a bad day, the rock develops a mosaic of narrow cracks. The greenish-grey surface is revealed to be just a shell depostied around another object - a round, smooth sphere about five inches in diameter. The sphere is transparent, and it refracts and reflects the light of the sun in amazing ways. The sundial is bathed in a pale rainbow, and you'd swear the egg flicker and glow a bright yellow, like a sputtering gaslamp.

36 ceases the prayers at their appointed end, then clickerclacks forward. His body collapses in and around itself as he 'squats' low to stare with fascinated interest at the sphere.

Fredric, as well as several other faculty and students, are crowding out of the doors to nearby buildings. Everyone on campus is familiar with the strange 'clockwork monk', but the ritual with the sundial is something new. Nobody but Fredric seems to have realized that the orb is there.

Wulfgang is similarly situated over 'his' egg. Looking curiously at the yellow orb. "It looks almost like the sun..." He mentions, starting at it...

As if in response to Wolfgang, the object seems to glow... but only for an eyeblink. It would be easily missed.

"Maybe it's reflecting the sun-" Gerald begins, before trailing off. He pulls a small ruler from his pocket and measures the size of the caustics being formed by the sun's light shining through it. "My gods. It's _diamond_. A hollow diamond. How..."

A few moments pass. 36's gears grind and his body shivers a bit. "Mountainzz, hillz, riversz, placesz. Landzcapes. Searchingzzzz.." The voice goes out of attenuation for a moment, turning into a hiss of static. "... hunting. Travel."

Fredric approaches, shooing of the few other students (and a few other professors.) "Just a geology experiment, yes, sorry to have disturbed you, I'll be in my office later, thanks, yes." He pulls one student aside, and in a low voice, gives an order. "Find the Chancellor, please, or his secretary and tell them that Professor Fredric needs them immediately in the St. Martin's building, thanks. Well, get a move on!" And then he's there, in time to catch the last words of 36' reverie. When he catches sight of the orb, his jaw drops, and stays dropped.

Wulfgang's eeys are still on the orb. He still dares not touch it, expecially with the Chancellor on his way. "Well, at least our frost week won't be boring, eh?"

Gerald shakes his head, reaching out as if to touch the globe, then draws his hand back. "No... no it won't."

The mechanical man stays still but for some noisy oscillations of his internals. "Bookz of placez. Pictures?" His head snaps up and he turns to home in on Fredric's face, staring at the professor.

Fredric startles, for this is the first time in his tenure that 36 addressed him first. "The library, of course," he says softly. "There's an entire shelf with sketches of everywhere we've visited." He reaches out carefully with the tongs, taking hold of the orb. "And I'm for going there now."
