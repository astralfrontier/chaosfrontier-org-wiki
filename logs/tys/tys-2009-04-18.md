# University of Tys 2009-04-18

The barge is ready to leave the city. Its crew consists of the students, Wulfgang and Gerald; their teacher, Fredric; the armsman, Choi; and the mechanical man, 36. The barge's nominal owner, a man named Rodrigo, is also along to serve as pilot of the craft. He's not a sailor by habit; like most people from the areas outside the city, farming is his full-time job.

The small craft wouldn't be a working vessel, anyway. It's really more of an enlarged raft, with a cabin in the middle for perishables. The current payload is mostly preserved food and coal for the engine, which Wulfgang tends at the rear of the vessel.

Fredric brings the last crate on himself. He opens it, and shows the students the contents. "A field lab in a single trunk," he explains. "Even smaller than what we bring on a ship. Weight will be an issue at two points on this trip. If it turns out that we can't move upstream through the Hammer Rapids, we'll need to get someone to carry it all. And there's no way we're sailing up the Falls of the Moon." He closes the trunk. "Also," he grumbles, "Bandwul has apparently caught a case of the cheap."

Gerald seems mildly disappointed at the contents. "I guess it can't be helped. We're gonna have a hard enough time carrying the sphere's cradle as it is."

"We'll see if we can hire some porters," Fredric muses. "But either way, 36 should be able to carry enough provisions for us to be effective"

36 bobs his head, neck joints clicking audibly, in not-so-silent assent.

Wulfgang's fingertips strom over the engine a bit, as he watches the others plan. "We have an accord. You behave, and I don't dismantle you for parts."

Everyone who needs to sleep that night, does so on the barge. The crystal sphere remains secure in its socket in the hut. Fredric awakens everyone just before dawn, so that Wulfgang can start the engine. The machine does, indeed, behave, turning coal and coke into motion. As the first rays of sun rise over the hills to the east, Rodrigo poles away from the dock. Few cityfolk are there to notice; some sailors out early (or late), and a few wannabe journalists are sketching the departure.

Wulfgang accepts his lot. After stoking and firing the engine, there isn't a lot of tending to be done. Unless something goes wrong.

Rodrigo steers the barge with a tiller and several long poles. Fredric is almost always tending to a map. "Eight miles an hour," he exclaims, as the barge slides easily up the mild waters. Farms and villages line the banks, and the city fades away to the south. "At this rate, we should reach Fort Hammer by nightfall tomorrow."

With Wulfgang manning the engine - and everyone aboard insisting on a lack of meddling with the craft's sole means upstream travel - Gerald must find other ways to occupy himself. Fortunately, one major project suggests itself to him. "If we're going to be traveling on foot," he says to himself, "the least I can do is make the cradle easier to carry." And so he finds himself amidships, sketching on a piece of slate, working on ways to cut down the weight and volume of the clockwork orrery that keeps the lenses pointed sunward.

The mirror assembly tracks the sun well, even at such a rapid pace of travel. The crystal sphere glints in the concentrated light. Every so often it will rotate of its own volition within the socket, or emit a quiet buzzing sound.

Every so often, 36 will emit one of his silent calls into the invisible world, asking if anyone is nearby who wishes to speak.

Once, close to noon, the sphere answers. "I have new information."

The mechanical man clanks his way toward the sphere, offering engagement if it wishes to address the human crew through him once again.

Wulfgang perks, moving from teh engine to stand by, listening to our charge.

The sphere speaks through 36's voice. "What part of the day are we able to travel?"

Wulfgang blinks. "We're able to travel all day, yes?"

Fredric answers. "More or less. We do have to moor at night. About twelve hours? Half the day."

The sphere speaks again. "Fifteen days."

"Are you assuming the same speed we've been making so far?" asks Gerald, pulling out a compass and looking over Fredric's shoulder at the map.

"Yes," the sphere replies. "Is that reasonable?"

Wulfgang blinks, "And someone mentioned some portage and some falls. So that going will be much slower..."

"Portage. I see. I shall consider it," the Sphere says. And then 36 can sense that it's withdrawn again, into whatever place it goes when it's thinking.

"So fifteen days... that means thirty times the distance we've come so far..." Gerald sets his compass. "I'm going to assume as the crow flies... how far up the river does that get us?"

By noon, the settlements on the banks are thinning out, and some forested areas are visible. "We'll be approaching the Old Forts soon," Fredric mentions. "Anyone remember what those are?"

Fredric offers the map to Wulfgang, and shrugs. "After Fort Hammer, nobody has bothered to make maps except Lord Tys himself, a hundred years ago. Don't feel badly. We're all out of date.

The steel shaman speaks up. "Zzettlement," he manages. "A day's ride. Fortificationzz. Camps. Outpostzz."

Wulfgang looks over at 36. "A dase ride from here?" He asks, slipping into his accented English that seems to come and go.

36's hand traces a circle in the air. "A day to ride to the outskirtzz," he explains slowly.

Fredric nods. "Right. One day for the calvalry, what the city fathers though was a good measure for the patrols." The Fredric frowns. "Mind, I don't know what they were patrolling for. Nobody has ever encountered any natives out this way... hmm." And then he's interrupted by Rodrigo, who hands the end of a barge pole at him.

"Your turn, Prosfessors," he cheerily quips. "That's the deal. Try not to hit any rocks, hey?" And he ducks into the hut. Within minutes, soft snoring can be heard from within.

Fredric sighs and steps up onto the pilot's box. "Note to self: remove 'Nautical Experience' from curriculum vitae."

Wulfgang looks at the Professor. "Sir, if you don't mind?" He walks over, and tries to take the barge pole from him. Assuming he assents, Wulfgang will start driving for a wile, "Just keep the fire fed?" He smirks.

Fredric is surprised at first, but hands over the barge pole willingly. "Very well, Mister Stentz."

Gerald just shakes his head. "Good thing I stuck to natural philosophy," he says, adjusting one of the cradle's gears with a wrench.

---

And so it goes for the rest of the day. Choi clears an area on the foredeck. The armsman is a man of many grins and few words, and he teaches all who show an interest in the use of the staff. In late afternoon, Rodrigo awakens, and is surprised to find Wulfgang at the tiller. "Well. We've grounded on none, so why not?"

A village appears around the next bend in the river. The walls of an old stone fort rise above the rooftops near the center of the settlement. Rodrigo poles in towards a low pier. "We went as far upriver in one day as we could go down. You'll put me out of the boat business, and for that, I thank you!"

After a few minutes of investigation, 36 approaches Gerald and Wulfgang. "Excuze me," he hums. "We have reached the places without walls? The outdoors?"

Gerald pats the cradle. "Time for you and your sphere to go to sleep for the night, I guess." He gives the crank handle a few more turns, winding the spring with just enough energy to let the machine catch the last few rays of the setting sun. The sound of the clockwork-bound spirit makes him look up. "Well, I see a few walls here, but we're on the outside of them all. I'd say yes."

36 thinks for a few moments. "Will anyone be awake here?" he asks further.

Wulfgang looks at 36. "Well, assuredly some peopel will be awake, yeah. Why does you ask?"

36 turns and begins tromping for the shore. He manages to fall over once off the ship, but rights himself and stands after a few moments, then starts on a beeline toward the settlement proper.

Wulfgang looks at Gerald. "I think.... We'd better go help him." Wulfgang doesn't wait for an answer, scampering after 36.

Gerald glances at Wulfgang. "Yeah. We're not in the University anymore. People aren't used to machines that walk by themselves." With that, he jogs after the receding machine.

Choi wordlessly picks up his staff - and Wulfgang's - and keeps pace a discreet distance behind the boys. He gives a smile and a nod to Fredric as he passes.

---

The main street through town is far more rustic than the University grounds, or any point between Highgate to the City's waterfront. Whereas those places had streets paved in stone or cinder, this street is just bare, dusty ground between the fronts of buildings. The alleys between the buildings are green with grass, and in some cases, weeds. The houses and shops have far more wood and far less stone in their construction. Oil lamps and candles flicker behind windows in the gathering dusk. In the city, the sound of humanity is everywhere; here, in the center of the street, one might still hear evening birdsong.

One end of the street leads to the old fort. Though the walls are made of stone, it is not the stone of the city. Stone buildings in the city are smooth and heavily worked, almost polished. These stones are in their native state, probably just things plowed up while clearing local fields, pile high and held together by centuries of mortar and mud.

The other end parallels the river, leading back towards the city from whence the barge came. The sun will be down in an hour; it seems that most people are inside at an evening meal, or getting an early start in the taverns.

Choi saunters up, keeping a discreet distance behind the boys, who are catching up to 36.

36 wobbles to a stop. He turns slowly in place, and approaches Choi. "Zzobzerver, watching uzz," he murmurs, the sound almost covered by the whining of his joints. "The building yonder. Sir, what should we do?"

Wulfgang looks over at the building indicated.

Choi hands Wulfgang one staff, and the other two Gerald. He bows to the boys. "I am at your disposal," he says, "for inquiring with this fellow." It may be the most he's ever said all day; he has a trace of an accent that one can only presume is from the Eastern kingdoms.

Gerald tilts his head, regarding 36 curiously. "Well, you're the one who brought us out here," he says, absently taking the staff. "Any thoughts on why? Or was it just the next thing to do?"

36's head wobbles its way to face Gerald. "Curiozzity," he says.

36 turns slowly. He comes to a resolution, and begins tramping toward the stranger, not deviating a whit, showing no sign of concealing his intent.

Gerald's fingers tighten on the staff. "Good a reason as any," he mutters to himself, following close behind 36.

Wulfgang gestures to Choi to follow, "Come on. At least we might be able to .. mediate a bit." He grips the proffered stick in his hands, turning to use it like one might a hiking staff.

Choi briefly puts a hand on Wulfgang's shoulder. "Boss says, 'Keep son out of trouble'. I hear, 'Keep son out of farmer's daughter.' Now I hear, 'Keep son out of jail.' You hear me?" He removes his hand and doesn't hinder the boy further.

The man doesn't move as the knot of cityfolk approach, but his eyes track their movements, and in particular 36. The villagers seem to be staying in side, though if it's by design or by accident is unclear. "A Shaman," he says, when they get within earshot. "Spirits giving voice to glass and metal."

"Yezz zir," agrees 36. "Are you a zzhaman?"

From this distance, it's easier to see that the wool cloak is the best piece of clothing on the man. His tunic is patched and his trousers are worn. He's dusty, though healthy and clear-eyed. A long second passes between 36's question, and the long, slow nod of his head.

"Do you know about the interior?" asks the metal man, given that he's not experiencing active hostility. "We wish to sail upriver."

The man nods again. He's not old. Despite his unkempt appearance, he's probably not older than the boys, and certainly younger than Fredric. "The river wishes it as well, though it may seem to fight you," he says. "You will go to the fort at the rapids," he says. One hand slowly extends, clutched in it a leather pouch. "You will need this."

36's head tilts to one side. "What izz it?" he buzzes.

"Hope for a troubled soul," the man replies. He rises slowly, arms drawing within his cloak. "I sleep in the forest this evening."

"Water flows downhill," says Gerald. "That's its nature. What is there of a river that could wish otherwise?" he asks. He sounds doubtful.

"May we vizit you there?" 36 asks.

Wulfgang stands silently. While usually ready to chat people up for hours, he figured this situation requires alternate diplomacy.

The man seems to loosen up a little, as if a weight came off his shoulders. "It is rough living to city eyes," he replies. "But follow if you wish. My name is Alec."

36 looks at himself, then at Alec. "I will follow," he says. "I would like to zzpeak more. And I will bring your name to otherz I meet, so that they will know what you have done."

---

The shaman's camp is an odd mix of temporary and lived-in. The center of the clearing has a fire ring, and surrounding it, some larger logs where one might sit. To one side, there's a lean-to, constructed of branches and sod, and a bed of pine boughs within. A low-hanging branch holds a large leather bag, the man's only apparent possession.

Alec scrapes back the top layer of ashes from the firepit, and throws on some dry logs. Within minutes there's a small fire going. He dusts the ashes from himself haphazardly, and then sits down. "You, lad, asked, what of a river, could wish to do other than flow downhill?" The man shrugs. "I know not, any more than I know what it is in brass, that could wish to take the shape of a man. But here we are."

Gerald looks embarrassed. "Yeah, I haven't figured out that one either," he says, glancing at 36. "But I will one of these days, mark my words."

Alec nods. "Curiosity. Maybe that's why the river wishes for you to make this journey." He smiles. "It is good to want, what destiny seems to have in mind for us. Easier that way."

"The Univerzzity of Tys built a body. I am Experiment 36," the metal man explains.

Alec nods. "I am Alec. I had more names once. Just one is enough for now."

Choi sits on the opposite side of the fire from Alec, still silent, still with amused expression.

Alec thinks for a moment, and then says, "The bag has herbs in it. Do you recognize them?"

36 leafs through the pouch for a few moments. "There is interesting medicine here," he concludes after the inspection. "Zztudents occasionally have azzked me for certain of these leaves."

Wulfgang coughs, "Noone present, of course." He glances at Choi.

"Really?" Alec looks surprised by the answer. "So it doesn't cure anything?"

36 looks up. "I cannot consume them," he says. "I think what izz here will bring someone from this dream to another. Perhapz a dream they prefer. For a time.."

Alec nods. "I see. There is someone at the next fort, who will need them." He is silent for a moment. "I gathered these things. I know not what they do. I will have faith, and leave her fate in your hands."

Gerald tries to figure out what 36 says. When he's finished, he seems surprised. "Well, what use is that to us Or to them?" he says. He tries to sound impatient, skeptical, but a part of his mind rails against his skepticism. It says, _36 speaks of seeing the world through a dream, and yet he walks in the waking world. Perhaps there is more that dreams have to offer the waking world than natural philosophy would acknowledge._

36 wobbles slightly. "I will see to it," he promises, after a few moments of consideration.

Alec nods. "Thank you. I ask that you leave me now. I know we shall speak again."

36 rises unsteadily to his feet. "Goodbye," he says.

Alec doesn't move. His eyes close slowly. "Until next time."

---

The sun has set when the explorers return to the barge. People are out on the main street of the village, though subdued, as tomorrow is another working day. The four cause some stir: a foreigner, a pair of boys, and a mechanical man. Nobody interferes, however, and Choi offers smiles and bows to passerby.

Fredric is waiting on a bench by the peer, looking worried, then relieved when he sees that all four are intact. He rises and hurries over, falling in step beside Choi. "What the _hell_?"

36 holds up the medicine pouch. "I will stow this safely. It is a package for a needy individual," he explains.

Choi shrugs, still smiling. "A local asked a favor. No harm done."

Fredric sighs. "Oh, very well." He doesn't press the point.

Wulfgang shrugs at Fredric. "I'll let you drive the boat this time, if it will make you feel better."

"Don't ask me where he comes up with this stuff," adds Gerald, referring to 36 and his pouch. "Some guy just gave it to him for no reason." He's been on edge the whole way back; the whole business chafes at his skeptical nature, but he can't just shut it out of his mind, and he doesn't know why not.

"Some guy," Fredric asks. "Sort of, what, a farmer? Villager?"

"A shaman," 36 volunteers.

Fredric looks confused. "Alright. Tell me all about it in the morning."

---

The cycle of the previous morning repeats: at the crack of dawn, Wulfgang fires the engine, and Rodrigo poles out into the middle of the river. A few locals are out on the docs, pointing and murmuring. There's no sign of Alec. As the barge gets under steam, the nameless town quickly fades into the distance.

Beyond the ring of old forts, the country is far less settled. A road follows the river on the east side. In some places it is covered over with fallen tree limbs, a sign that no repair crews have come this far since the recent winter. Farms and villages are less common; in several places the banks are choked with forests, their leafy canopies more than a hundred feet in the air. Rocks are more common here, so Rodrigo issues barge poles to everyone but Wulfgang, who is left tending the engine.

Noon comes and goes, and Rodrigo remains in the pilot's box. "Thought it would be my turn," Fredric calls.

Rodrigo snorts. "Get degree in pole, Prosfessor. We may need tomorrow. Besides, the lad knows better than you!"

Wulfgang glances over at the two.

Fredric mops his brow with a rag, and feigns offense. "Bandwul says that to me all the time."

Gerald mutters under his breath, as he fends the barge off a rock. "Stupid herbs," he is muttering. "What good is that gonna do anyone? Just make 'em see a bunch of pretty colors. Makes no sense." If anything, his night's sleep has only exaggerated his internal mental conflict.

The current is definitley stonger here; Wulfgang estimates that the barge only makes four knots of headway now. Fort Hammer comes into sight in the late afternoon, but it still takes two hours to reach the small pier outside its walls. The Hammer Rapids, for which the fort is named, are visible and audible just a little further up the river. Rodrigo ties the barge to the pilings. "Maybe we can," he says to Fredric. "Not easy. But maybe we can. Easier, if we could find someone to portage, but even empty it's five tons."

Fredric's brow furrows. "Let's see what we can talk the Army into, then."

Wulfgang glares at the motor for a second, "If we disassembled that.." he points, "Would it be less weight to haul?"

Gerald says nothing, staring at the motor. "That thing's been doing a pretty good job of hauling itself up to now. Kind of ironic that we'd end up having to carry _it_..."

The fort is far larger than the one at the last town, and obviously of more recent construction. The outer walls are lashed together from timber. The logs probably came from the treestumps in the cleared area that surrounds the fort to some distance. Instead of small streams of smoke rising from many fires of private houses, the fort is the genesis of several large, thick streams, probably from barracks and company kitchens. The front gates are open. About half the men wear the Duchy's uniform; the others look like woodmen, fur traders, and the like. There's some women and children, too, though fewer than even the University.

"It is called kindness," 36 says, musing. "We must thank it properly for the work it has done for uzz."

Wulfgang looks at 36. "We feed it coal and coke. What more does it want? A belt massage?"

36's gears whine slightly as he considers this. "I will azzk it if it wakes up," he promises.

Wulfgang sighs exasperatedly, "Just what I need, a talking steam engine..."

36 thinks. "But.. if it spoke, could it not tell you what was wrong with it, should it break down?" he asks in confusion.

Choi's hand descends on Wulfgang's shoulder at the same time that Fredric's descends on Gerald's. "Calm down, you two," Fredric says. "We need to make a good impression here."

Gerald has finally had enough. "Wakes up? Wakes up? It's a machine. It doesn't have any fancy magic water in it. It only moves by itself because it's burning a bunch of coal!" He pokes one of the gears with his staff, and looks up at Fredric as the professor puts a hand on his shoulder. "What?!"

With his other hand, Fredric motions towards the gates of the fort, where a pair of uniformed men are staring wide-eyed towards the barge.

36 says nothing, meekly falling into lockstep behind Fredric.

Gerald glares at Fredric for a moment, then sighs, gritting his teeth and allowing himself to be led. He turns his gaze to the steam engine instead. "Why _can't_ it carry itself over land?" he mutters to himself. "Just give me five minutes..."

Wulfgang stares at Gerald. "Wait... Don't break that..." He starts to move in the direction of his classmate.

"That's a fine idea," Fredric says, in a fatherly tone. "But next time, okay?" He removes his hand. "Remember, we're looking for the source of the Sphere. We're going to need help from the people here. I promise you they won't ask if the barge has feelings."

Gerald laughs briefly at Wulfgang. "You think I don't know how to work with a steam engine? Don't worry, I won't hurt your precious baby." He shakes his head. "Yeah, all right. Let's just get on with it. I'll have another look at the thing in the morning."

Wulfgang bristles at this. "Preciou-" and then the talking to that Gerlad got rings in his ears. He falls in line with the others....

Choi falls into step beside 36, and behind Fredric. He smiles over at the small metal man, but says nothing, as usual. The two gate guards are armed, but with ceremonial shortswords rather than pikes or firearms; one has the shoulder braids of an officer, the other the tabs of a sargeant-at-arms. The officer speaks as Fredric approaches. "State your business," he says flatly. "Like I can't guess," he adds.

"We're an expedition from the University," Fredric replies. "These are my students, Gerald Linkletter and Wulfgang Stentz. This is Choi, an Employee of the Stentz family." He doesn't mention 36. "We'd like to speak to the Colonel."

The officer nods, as if he's listening to Fredric repeat himself. "Right. And you are?" Fredric hands over some kind of letter; the officer reads it. "Professor Fredric. The Colonel is busy this evening. We can offer you accomodations in guest quarters." He points to a building in the far corner of the fort. "But I wouldn't expect too much from him right now -" The officer is interrupted by a high-pitched shriek from elsewhere in the compound.

Wulfgang's head swivels to the direction of the shriek.

The shriek doesn't seem to startle most of the people inside the fort, but the officer pinches the bridge of his nose and curses. "Jens, get someone to explain it to them. I'll handle it this time." He rushes off.

"What the hell was that all about?" asks Gerald. He manages to avoid reacting physically to the scream, instead turning to 'Jens', who appears designated to supply the answer.

"Colonel's daughter," Jens replys laconically. "She's... ill. Don't know the disease, so we don't know the cure." The shriek comes again, and lasts longer. There's a commotion by the front door of a large house near the far wall, distinct in that it seems built as a residence, rather than a bunkhouse.

Wulfgang's head can't help but turn to 36.

36 tugs lightly at Fredric's sleeve to get his attention, and mutely holds up the medicine bag.

Fredric nods, but mutters, "I don't think this is a good time."

36's gears whine as he looks around. He tries holding up the pouch to Wulfgang, who's looking his way.

Wulfgang points to 36. "Our..." He stumbles for the word, "Friend here is an herbalist and wants to help the ill lady..." HIs face looks inncosent, and his eyes endearing, as he looks at Jens.

At that moment, the voice starts to wail, "They're coming! Oh, Gods, they're here! They're already here!" And then the voice degenerates into sobs, which become less audible; about half the crowd turns and looks directly at the gate where the explorers are gathered.

Jens looks over (and down) at Wulfgang, and then at 36, and again at Fredric. Choi, for once, is not smiling; Fredric looks... not frightened. Maybe resigned. "Just who did you say you are, sir?" Jens asks pointedly.
