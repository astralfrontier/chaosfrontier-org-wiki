# University of Tys 2009-08-15

The great forest river of the past week has given way to dozens of smaller streams threading through marshy flatlands. The escarpment rises in the distance like the walls of an immense city, forbidding and utterly foreign. The obvious way up is a slope of talus heaps and subsidence falls that ascends the 200-foot distance like a set of irregular stairs, half a mile long.

It's not ideal terrain for the barge-turned-omnibus. Everyone is constantly busy just to make headway. Wulfgang and Gerald maintain the engine and drivetrain. The wheels frequently bog down in the soft ground. The adult chaperones spend a lot of time pulling it at first, before discovering that 36 is more effective by himself than all three put together. The little metal man is not stronger, but he does not tire.

At first, Cassandra is left with nothing to do. She argues with Fredric. "Listen, I live in the hinterlands. I know how to ride and how to use a sword. I'm not some delicate foreign songbird!"

"Maybe not," Fredric replies, distracted from repairing a wheel. "But you are your father's daughter, and for that we'll spare your person the indignity." Cassandra looks like she might explode. He quickly adds, "If you must get your hands dirty, fill the rainwater barrels from that spring we found. It tested pure and..." he pulls his sweat-soaked shirt away from his shoulders. "We do surely need it."

The gap between the end of the forest and the base of the long slope is perhaps twenty miles wide, and it takes all day to cross. The explorers make camp at the base of the slope - still half a mile from the escarpment itself, though from here, its features are clearly visibly.

The sun sinks in the west. The whole rock face is illuminated in bright reds and golds. Some parts are covered by vegetation; stubborn pines cling to the side of the cliff in acts of defiance against gravity, or perhaps merely desperation. In many places, bare rock is visible, and the lighting of dusk picks out long horizontal bands of sedimentation.

Wulfgang's eyes gaze over the majestic beauty before him. He smiles, leaning back against his normal post at the steam engine, as he looks over the colorful ridges and strata presented before him. Of course, he's never had much of a head for natural sciences, so it doesn't really indicate anything, but it's beautiful, all the same. "Wow..."

Experiment 36 studies the layers of minerals before him, allocating time to then look down and click his own metal fingers together. His eyes follow the layers up and down. "A book," he says at last, in his tinny voice. "It iz a book. A history book. Iz it not?"

Fredric wanders over. "Yes," he says quietly. "This is how the World records its own history. A high cliff or deep canyon is as good as a history book..." he trails off. "And as far as I know, this is the first one anyone's seem within a hundred miles of here."

"If it's a history book, it goes back a lot longer than the ones at the University," remarks Gerald, peering one of the whitish layers. "There was a volcanic eruption here, long, _long_ ago, for example. And some time after that..." He taps at a blackish layer near the top. "A bog... presumably long before this area was disrupted again. It formed a coal seam. And this..." He taps a glittering layer between them. "I don't even know what this is."

"Zo then..." 36 pauses, hesitantly grinding his gears. "What iz below this place now?"

Fredric points all the way to the top of the escarpment and the dusk gathering on the plateau beyond. "'Now' is up there."

36 shakes his head. "I mean.... if thiz came from below, then.. what lies below there, that this does not?" he asks carefully.

"Oh," the Professor says. "We'd have to dig, or find a cave system." He kicks the ground and frowns. "If anything did come up from below, it's since been filled in, I would guess, by this mud and sand. The... um... sphere... it remembers mudslides, does it not?"

No visions disturb anyone's slumber, but flashes of lightning and sounds of thunder come from up on the plateau. However, if it rains up there, the storm doesn't come to the valley - the oppressive humidity of the day gives way to a misty, foggy calm at night.

The next day, the rolling barge begins its ascent of the escarpment. The ground is more firm and the going easier, and Fredric frequently leads short trips to interesting rock or vegetation features. "It's a pity we don't have months," he laments. "There's so much that we could learn here."

During the ascent, 36 contacts the First of Six. "What do you remember of thiz place, now that you are here again?" he asks curiously.

The sphere buzzes and floats out of its cradle. "Still far from home," it says. "This slope was not here. I remember bare, unweathered rock... we had worked here very little."

Nodding for a moment, 36 then turns his attention to Fredric. "So.. how old muzt this history book be, if its author were the Planet alone?" he asks.

"Huh?" Fredric is working with a big pile of sample jars; he's missed 36's contact with the sphere. "Hard to say, how fast things build up. Rivers might sediment up to an inch per year. This far inland, away from running water? As little as a tenth or a twentieth of that. This cliff face - " he motions beyond the kneeboards of the barge. "If this is typical, it's between five and ten thousands years of exposed history."

The metal man considers this, and returns his attention to the sphere, making sure it heard and understood Fredric's answer. "Zo.. that iz your age?" he asks curiously.

The question generates a storm of confusion. "One century. Two centuries. Seventy-eight years. Twelve millenia." And then a very, very large number, an impression of time so vast that 36 staggers from receiving it. Finally, the sphere quiet. "I do not know."

Wulfgang blinks and watches this exchange... "That's a while...." He's sort of lost, this above his head just a bit. He smiles though, eyes still surveying the rock..

After a moment of silence, 36 explains his questions and relays the answers. "Zo..now I am deeply curious what may lie buried below," he finishes.

Unlike previous conversations, the sphere continues to move after 36 'hangs up.' It floats over and observes Fredric cataloguing his sample jars. The professor stops as the sphere approaches. "Umm... can I help you?" he asks carefuly. The sphere emits a single buzz and settles on top of a nearby barrel. Fredric shrugs and continues with his work, though he seems reluctant to turn his back on the sphere.

Shortly after noon, the rolling barge crests the escarpment, and everyone gets their first look at the material reality behind the visions and rumors.

The top of the plateau is flat and there's little cover anywhere. No trees higher than a man are visible, though water seems to be plentiful. The horizon is lost in a haze.

The most striking feature is the vegetation. Everything that is not bare rock, is covered by a carpet of reddish-purple weeds, ferns, and bushes. Even the daylight has an eerie magenta cast to it. There's hardly any green anywhere, saved for a few choked pine trees that seem to have crept up from the valley, and stalled at the top of the wall.

The fauna is different as well. Whereas birdsong filled the river forest, here there is the buzzing of insects. Solitary dragonflies dart here and there.

Wulfgang looks over the weeds, "That's.. not natural.. is it?" He points down at the.. almost grotesquely colored vegetation.

Fredric is dumbstruck. "Uhh... well. It's plant life... but..." he is quiet for a long moment. "No. This isn't natural."

36 is taking notes carefully. "The color--" he says aloud as he writes, then pauses. "Out of space." Setting aside the completed journal, he picks up another one and resumes his scribing duties.

Cassandra walks slowly to the prow of the barge and kneels. Her chin sinks to the railing, between hands in a white-knuckle grip. She mutters something distinctly unladlylike. Then, only barely more audibly, "I am coming for you, you bastard."

Wulfgang reaches out to grab Cassandra's wrist before she gets too far....

Cassandra glares viciously at Wulfgang, then relaxes. "Please... unhand me," she says, with visible effort.

Wulfgang looks back, "As long as you aren't going anywhere... in the ... right now.." He unhands even as he says this, but will resume his grasp if it looks like she's trying to wander off again...

Gerald steps up beside Cassandra. "Don't forget that you don't stand alone. We _all_ need to fight... this..." He pauses, and peers out across the landscape. "What _caused_ this? Magic, or science? And if magic, what _kind_ of magic?" He looks at the sphere.

Wulfgang respectfully steps back as Gerald interjects.

Cassandra rubs her wrist, and looks sullen. She shakes her head, once, and sits down under a tarp. She found a whetstone somewhere, to go with her borrowed sword, and busies herself with it.

She stops for a moment, and looks up, though not at anyone in particular. "We call it magic, but do they care? The Herald didn't know it was a demon. And are we to presume thereby, that your pet orb is really any kind of angel?" She resumes with the whetstone. "You're right. I'm not alone, and I'm glad you're here. But we're fooling ourselves to think we understand."

Wulfgang mutters to himself, "Can anyone really understand?"

"Yes," Fredric says, simply, unpretentiously. "If not, we should all just stay home."

There aren't many waterways up here; the water collects in springs and pools and streams, none big enough to bother with using for transportation. The rolling barge is now a pure ground vehicle. It's a good thing that it's here; each different species of vegetation on the plateau seems to be offensive in a different way. There's a type of vine that grows in broad matts, which trips men on foot. The bushes have brambles and thorns. Some of the ferns numb exposed skin; others cause irritation and itching with prolonged contact.

36 takes to going first; he has no human flesh to irritate and no living mechanism to disrupt. He tries to clear a path for the others in his own slow and clumsy way, when an expedition away from the barge is called for.

With 36's help, the barge makes good progress. The flat ground, at least, is easy going for the wheels. Though the axles tangle in vines with some frequency, progress is excellent. Fredric collects many specimens and busies himself cataloging them, which Choi and Rodrigo keep watch.

Wulfgang looks about, as his senses perk up, pickign something up. He watches the coal burn, watchign the flames that carefully trickle over the metered fuel turn blue along the whisps and the edges. He looks over to Gerald, and points, "I don't think the coal we had was that bad, right?" He says, as if Gerald if goign to know what this means, "I think it's a bit... sour around here? The air, I mean..."

Gerald sniffs, and wrinkles his nose. "Well, it's generally foul, but... hm. I think it'd be a bad idea to do any more exertion than we can possibly avoid." He looks over the edge of the barge. "It's fortunate that we have someone along that doesn't _need_ to breathe."

Fredric holds up a sample jar. "Maybe that's why we only see this stuff up on the plateau, and not in the valley. It doesn't even breathe the same air as we do... hey, is this one moving?"

36's whining clockwork is the only sound he makes in answer, as he continues his careful transcription of the team's findings in their journals.

It's obvious that it is, within the sample jar; a cutting of a vine is moving with a feeble, wormlike twitching.

Wulfgang's eyes frantically dart over to what Fredric is indicating with reference to his query.

"Most things obey the line between animal and plant," Fredric intones softly.
