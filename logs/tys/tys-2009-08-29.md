# University of Tys 2009-08-29

The plateau is no less eerie at night. In moon and starlight, the purplish-red plant life looks simply black, and everything else looks a little more normal. As the air cools and the acrid smell diminishes; a light breeze washes away some of the oppressive humidity of the day. When the engine of the barge is shut down, there's almost no sound, not even the familiar sound of small animals in the underbrush.

Wulfgang looks around at the hostility that surrounds the vessel. He looks at his companions, "I think we'll need a fire tonight..."

Fredric nods. "Yes. It will make us feel better, at least."

Gerald wrinkles his nose. "The way the air smells... I think we should make sure someone's awake at all times to watch a fire. And at that, the coal won't make a proper fire." He looks around at the plants. "Let's start now. I want to see what happens when we burn these _now_, while we're all awake."

Wulfgang looks back at the rest of the crew. "Okay then." He wanders over to the equipment area, and picks up one of the machetes. He looks over the side of their boat, large cutting knife in hand, and starts over the edge, approaching one of the plants.

The local flora is characterized by shallow root systems and broad, tough, fleshy leaves in the typical purplish color. Some varieties glisten with slick or sticky secretions. They don't cut easily, but they do burn, and give off clouds of an unpleasant white smoke. In the gentle breeze of the evening the smoke rises in a single column until it disappears into the dark.

As it seems he's not attacked immediately, WUlfgang enlists Gerald and 36 to help him cut a good amount of the flora. Probably enough that they could take some along in their craft.

While the students are cutting brush, Fredric retrieves a small crate from the barge's shed and opens it. He shows the contents to Choi, Rodrigo, and Cassandra. "Do you know how to use one of these?" he asks. Rodrigo shakes his head; Choi shrugs. "Not my style."

"I do," Cassandra replies flatly. She withdraws in item from the crate - a medium-sized, single-shot, breech loading firearm, popular with hunters and soldiers alike. The girl cracks open the action and peers down the barrel. "A little, anyway."

Fredric smiles. "Thought you might. Very well, miss. You can teach the rest of us."

The night passes without incident, perhaps surprisingly. The plants make poor fuel for the fire, but having one provides light and heat, and as importantly, a morale boost. Everyone is able to get most of a night's sleep.

The fire is still burning weakly when it happens. The sun hasn't yet risen, but there's little on the plateau to obscure the early pinkish light that comes before dawn. The breezes of evening fade, but there's another noise...

The night has passed without any of the usual forest noises. As light returns to the plateau, something is rustling through the underbrush, approaching the barge.

Gerald is still grumpy about having been woken up, and on edge from the air of menace that had followed them all the previous day. The instant he sees movement, he lifts his rifle and fires off a shot at it. Only then does he yell, "Wake up, something's coming!", realizing belatedly that his yell couldn't have been nearly as loud as the sharp crack of the cartridge going off.

Wulfgang starts awake, forst at the sounf of the gunshot, then at Gerals's yell. He still has a lot of sleep in his eyes, but Choi insists he sleep with his stick next to him...

The sounds of a gunshot is, in fact, plenty loud enough to wake up a campful of edgy explorers, almost instantly. The shot itself tears deep into the tangle of purplish ferns. Whether it strikes anything is hard to know; but something does leap high out of the undergrowth in that direction. It's only visible for an eyeblink, and it seems to be of the same red-purple color as everything else up here, a flailing mass of vinelike appendages. The thing vaults through the air, making a keening squeal as it goes, and keeps coming.

Wulfgang grabs his stick and runs forward, ready to meet the charge. Well, as ready as the socialite sailor is going to be for armed combat. He looks at Gerald, "Nice shooting."

36 rises almost instantly, making a high-pitched screeching noise that blends with the grinding sound of his engaged drive-train. He lurches about for a moment, then sees the scene. And immediately he trundles in the direction he's chosen: straight toward Gerald.

Creatures, for they can only be described such, burst out of the underbrush from three directions. A pair come from the left, a pair from the right, and one, the one that Gerald shot at, comes from straight ahead. Each barrel-shaped body ends in three thick, vinelike limbs. The things move with an agitated, flailing gait. Sometimes they flip end-for-end, apparently having no preference for which limbs are used for locomotion versus manipulation.

The armsman Choi leaps over the side of the barge and charges towards the pair of creatures on the left. He swings an iron-shod staff low through the air; one of the creatures comes up short, avoiding the blow, while the other keeps coming.

Wulfgang moves up to engage the one that Gerald hit in Melee, hopefully cutting off it's advance into our firing squad. He holds his stick out, thrusting it forward with both hands, almost mechanically. The creature manages to take a step back, and avoid his stick.

The stocky mechanical man picks up speed, huffing and grinding. He body-checks the nearest oncoming creature, picking it up off the ground for just a moment by main force. There's a shriek of protesting metal, and one or two of his torsion wires sing a song of tortured parting.

Rodrigo has only a large utility axe as a weapon, and is no armsman. Still, he hops down from the barge, and holds his weapon ready should anything venture near enough to hit.

Choi swings his staff with both hands choked up on the base of the thing. The speeding, iron tip lands dead center in one of the creatures with a loud, moist crunch. The creature is staggered; its fellow comes forward towards the arsman.

Cassandra and Fredric are still on the barge, carbines balanced on top of crates. Within a second, two shots split the air, and two of the creatures are hit. The heavy slugs make visible exit wounds, trailing a disgusting, moist puff of inky black ichor.

The two monsters don't slow down - they scramble up over the walls of the barge and towards Fredric and Cassandra.

The creature that 36 attacked is still on the ground. It stubbornly lashes out and batters at the small mechanical man. For the most part, it can do little to bend brass, but the fleshy limbs entangle and snarl at exposed cables and strain pulleys.

Two of the creatures are attacking Choi, who is surrounded by the creeping, grasping limbs. His grunts turn to a shriek of pain.

As he finishes reloading, Gerald looks around, bewildered at the onslaught of the strange... things. All his friends are beset on all sides... finally, more primal considerations take over, his intellect supplying only the reminder that he isn't really used to these guns. "Cassandra!" he yells, raising the rifle to his shoulder.

Wulfgang sees 36 getting entagled, and runs over to assist, pulling his staff back like one would a gofl club, and swinging it into the thatch of vines that is the thing.

While the mechanical man is a strong lifter, his steel servos are not optimized for the sort of activity he now engages in. Nevertheless, the supernatural drive-train which animates him is energized by the sight of his friends in trouble, and the stout wooden pole he wields serves him well in striking a decisive blow. He turns, watching the others, deciding where to go next...

Rodrigo sees Choi staggering under the combined assault of two of the creatures. The boatman charges forward and swipes at one with his axe.

Choi backpedals towards the barge, swinging his staff in wide arcs to discourage the creatures from following. "Get back!" he snarls at Rodrigo. "Let me do my job!"

On the barge, two of the creatures have hauled themselves over wall and are advancing on Fredric and Cassandra. They are not looking healthy; in fact, they're leaving a trail of some red-black fluid that might be blood.

Cassandra drops her carbine and takes up her shortsword; Fredric has one of the staves. They batter at the advancing monsters; Cassandra sinks her sword into one nearly to the hilt. The thing emits an inhuman shriek and its limbs slow.

Fredric is not so lucky; his attacker batters into his right leg, squeezing and tearing where it can.

Choi retreats, swinging his axe inexpertly. A vinelike limb bashes his hand, and the boatman winces and snarls.

Gerald breathes a sigh of relief as Cassandra proves more than capable of taking care of herself. Shifting his aim slightly, the young student takes aim at the monstrosity threatening his professor, pulls the trigger, and cries a yell of triumph as the shell splashes it against a nearby crate.

Wulfgang looks to make sure his current target was dispatched by 36, and he closes over to the two that Choi seems to be having a bit of trouble with. He closes 'behind' one, if one can be behind these things, and swings his stick, in the heat of battle forgetting the training that Choi has instilled, swingling wildly like a baseball bat, and missing wide. Strike one.

This time, 36's proclivity to clumsiness gets the better of him. He charges another of the monsters, but manages to lose his balance and topple backward onto the deck.

Choi takes advantage of 36's appearance to smash his staff against the one remaining uninjured opponent. He sweeps it against the thing's limbs like a man reaping grain.

Fredric retrieves his carbine and starts loading it. Cassandra takes one look at the melee and dashes to it. She hops over the low wall of the boat, sword still drawn.

Wulfgang lines up to the next combatant, his total wiff last time still buning his cheek a red color. He should be better than this.. He lines up as Choi showed him, ready to swing at the vine creature. His staff connects this time, catching the creature in it's stalk, his staff buries itself into the purple sinue, and he has to yank his hands free, the ground spilling with the sickeningly colored thing's bits.

From the ground, the dauntless shaman tries to swing with his staff; but, clumsy as he is, and disadvantaged as his position, he connects with nothing.

The battle is clearly in favor of the explorers; only two of the creatures remain. Rodrigo and Cassandra are dealing with one; the monster is covered in slices and cuts and leaving trails of dark red fluid on the ground. Choi seems to be paying the other back for some insult, bashing it repeatedly with his iron-sleeved staff.

Wulfgang takes his staff, and, much to the cringing of Choi, places his hands together on the pole, and swings it over his head, allowign the stick to slack into one of the prone things, his stick splattering through the viney mass, and smacking the thing dead.

Gerald pulls back the bolt on his carbine, a quick glance confirming that the threat is almost in abeyance. He draws the rifle quickly to his shoulder, pulls the trigger, and finishes off the remaining foe.

36 rises unsteadily to his feet, putting the pole to a more pacifist use than prior. His head wobbles this way and that as he surveys the outcome of the struggle.

The metal man's internal mechanisms are damaged; decades have passed since he was involved in any sort of real altercation, and the clockwork was never intended to stand the strain of combat. He looks down at himself curiously.

Gerald, for his part, has never been involved in a stand-up fight at all. He draws a deep breath, his hands shaking as he sets down the rifle. "What... what on Earth _were_ those things?" he murmurs.

Wulfgang wanders over to 36, and looks him over carefully, "You seem a bit worse for wear, my friend." He offers 36 a hand up, although he probably isn't going to be much help.

Fredric limps over to the creature that attacked him and prods it with the toe of his boot. "Not from any of the six great families of species. Not like anything I've ever seen before."

Cassandra sits down near the barge, an exceedingly grim look on her face. "Are we good, or are we lucky?" She pulls a rag from a pocket and cleans the ichor from her shortsword. "Father would ask that question a lot."

"We are alive," responds 36 as he busies himself with the care of the living, extracting bandages, herbs and strange sparkling crystals from a pouch he carries. He works on Choi first, being more wounded, but in several minutes is able to respond to Fredric's needs as well.

Gerald, for his part, has pulled out a tape measure and a screwdriver, and even as 36 examines Frederic and Choi, he does the same for the mechanical man. "There is an odd symmetry to this," he comments, as he takes an inventory of the bent cogwheels, broken axles, and other damage. "The machines care for the humans, and the humans care for the machines."

The metal man swivels his head to look at Gerald. In spite of a lack of a face, there's still a smile there. "That iz how it should be, Mr. Gerald," he replies, before returning to his ministrations.

Rodrigo climbs back into the boat and finds Fredric. "I'd say you aren't paying me enough, Professor," he begins, "But never mind that," he smiles. "My kids are never going to believe what their father did on his summer holiday."

"In a way, it's easier with machines," Gerald says to 36, as he labors over the repair process. "We know exactly how your body was put together, and so we know how to put it back the same way. With people... we don't quite know so much about how we're put together."

"That iz the path of the shaman, Mr. Gerald," 36 says softly, looking down at the disassembled remnants of one of his arms with detached interest. "To walk in two worldz, to zee both and to bring them together. To be capable of embracing duality." He looks up at the young man. "It iz profoundly peaceful in such a place."

Gerald looks back at 36, and there is an odd glint in his eyes. "A synthesis... yes, of course," is all he says aloud.
