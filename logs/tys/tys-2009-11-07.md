# University of Tys 2009-11-07

The sphere leads the party away from the spire, across the lake, and the base of an oddly-shaped hillock a half a mile away. This close to the center of the valley, it's easy to forget the long trek through the 'red life' and the danger it poses. The air here is clean and sweet, though insect noises are few and birdsong is absent.

Fredric picks up handfuls of the dry, sandy dirt and lets it sift through his fingers. "Clay-like," he mutters. "Usually found at depth. But dessicated, here." He kicks a medium-size clod and it disintegrates. "And this hill is oddly-shaped. Like something is buried here."

"There is," the sphere buzzes, "though I only now recall it." It has lead everyone around to the base of the hill on the opposite side from the lake. From this side, the hill is almost vertical and covered only by tough, scrubby grasses; a few trees provide cover at ground level. The sphere settles onto a limb. "I cannot open the way for you," it says. "You must dig here."

"Finally," says Gerald, passing out the shovels he'd brought from the barge, and thrusting his own into the sandy soil. "Mmmph. Spent too much time in the library for this."

36 takes up a shovel. Slowly, steadily, he excavates soil. He's used to much smaller digs and more precision in the dirt he moves about, of course, but this is familiar work.

The soil is sandy and mostly free of rocks, but it's hardly pleasant work. To their credit, Choi, Rodrigo, and Fredric take their turns in the rotation.

Cassandra tries to take her turn as well, but is quickly pre-empted by Fredric. "I'm sorry, miss, but I'll not answer to your father for making you dig pits."

Wulfgang takes his turn putting spade to earth. He looks at his companions, and watches teh object as it is revealed.

Finally, there's the unmistakable clang of metal on stone... or something like it...

The shovel has struck a buried slab of stone. The blade of the tool has cut a bright line from the stone, where it's scraped away the caked dirt. The blade itself is heavily scratched now along one side. Fredric has a look at the abused iron. "Whatever it is, it's hard."

Wulfgang runs his hands along the item that they jsut unearthed. "I think we reacehd bottom, ina ny case..."

"No," the sphere chirps. "We have reached the top. Find the edges. We must descend."

Wulfgang blinks, and looks back at the sphere. "You're the boss, I guess.." He mumbles, and applies more spade to earth, trying to find the edges of the structure.

Thinking a moment, 36 decides how to resolve the issue happening in the periphery of his vision. "Mizz Cassandra," he calls. "We are overcome by the exzitement of the moment and have forgotten zomething. Will you pleaze retrieve some writing materials from the barge and document our actionz here?"

"It iz vital that we have a record of these eventz," he adds.

Cassandra rouses from her sulk. Something about the metal man's words has mollofied her. "Oh yes, of course." She takes off at a jog. "Don't move it without me!" she calls back.

Further digging exposes the limits of the thing. It's a circular stone slab, worked almost totally smooth, and capping a meter-wide stone tube that descends vertically into the earth. It's so finely worked that the seam between the two is almost invisible.

Rodrigo lays down his shovel and sits. The boatman is used to hard work, but he's still covered in sweat. "Great. Looks like the lid of a septic tank."

"Pleaze rest if you require," advises 36. "I can continue working."

Wulfgang looks at the lid, "Instead of more digging, maybe we can see if the lid comes off the pipe?"

Fredric runs a hand over the thing. "Love to... but no human hands will move this..." He looks 36 over. "Well. If you would oblige us, 36."

With Cassandra in attendance and recording what happens next, Experiment 36 trundles forward. His metallic arms carefully embrace the slab. There's a momentous grinding of gears and the distinctive twang of wire under tension, and a high-pitched keening that the others haven't heard him bake before. His frame shivers, but it's enough; the slab moves, and not slowly.

The capstone moves aside to reveal a chimneylike tunnel, made of the same uniform grey stone, that descends straight down into the earth. Ladderlike rungs, sized for human hands, are set into one wall. The overhead sun illuminates a metallic grating about fifteen feet down, though it's unclear if this is the bottom of the shaft. Otherwise, it's completely dark.

36 thinks for a moment. "First of Zix, will you be able to operate in the darkness below?" he asks.

The sphere rises shakily from the branch where it has watched all this take place. "I shall for a short time," it says. "But I remember little." It settles onto the ground at Gerald's feet. "It would be wiser to carry me," it buzzes.

Wulfgang looks up at Fredric, as he prepares to moutn the ladder into the darkness, "I don't suppose we remembered a light?" He looks over to 36, . o O ( Oh yeah, that's a good idea... )

Fredric is leaning on his shovel; he might be tired, or he might be swooning. "To see something like this I'd light my own trousers on fire," he breathes.

Gerald hauls the sphere up onto his shoulder. "Here we go. Let's get moving."

Choi leaves and returns a moment later with two boxes - one containing lanters and oil, the other containing the party's weapons. "Keep your pants on, professor," he grates, "and keep your powder dry."

Wulfgang starts heading down the ladder while the others gather up the lanters and such. He goes as far as he can before he can't really see to continue, he looks up at Choi, who produces the light, "Thanks." he beams.

Wulfgang reaches the landing first, somewhat to Fredric's dismay. "Hey! Be careful that you don't disturb any artifacts!" The professor seems to have recovered some of his wits, but he needn't worry. The grating seems to be of cast steel, and it holds only dust. Wulfgang sees another grating ten feet below, and a low corridor leads away from the shaft, into what must be the interior of the oddly-shaped hill.

Wulfgang steps aside, slightly down the corridor as the others come down.

The box contains four large lanterns, eight carbide miner's lamps, and sufficient fuel for both. Fredric absently asks Gerald to prepare the the lamps, then descends into the shaft to stand beside Wulfgang. "The corridor opens up inside the hill," he says. "Come, Master Stentz. Let's establish an advanced guard.

Wulfgang turns his head to Fredric, and raises an eyebrow. "Okay, Professor." he says, heftign one of the lanterns, and starting down the corridor.

One by one, the explorers file into the room within the hill. It takes some time to figure out the shape of it - it's really more of a system of narrow catwalks and gangways. There's six levels, each maybe ten feet high. It appears that the 'hill' is really a buried structure, and only the topmost level is above the present valley floor.

Most of the walls are made of the same kind of stone as the shaft you've excavated. They are assembled from one-meter slabs that seem to be perfectly square. The joints are filled with some kind of dense, spongy material that might be rubber, but far tougher than any rubber you've ever encountered.

At first, you think that the wall on the side facing the lake might be bare earth, but closer inspection shows that it's covered by a thin, perfectly smooth, and almost perfectly transparent layer of crystal - as if someone had buried a window.

Gerald is growing more excited as they progress into the tunnels. "This isn't a natural cave," he says, holding the lantern high above his head. "This is a building! An underground building! And completely beyond anything we can build in the City."

The space between the front and back walls is about two meters, and mostly filled with a complex mechanism of rods, gears, and mirrors. Steel railings separate it from the catwalks, one would guess both to protect the fragile mechanims and the limbs of any interlopers. It all seems oddly familiar...

Fredric is silent, even dumbstruck. "'Some legends say man came from the sky, others from the hidden places beneath the earth...'" he whispers.

"Wait..." Gerald says, tracing the mirrors. "This..." he says, running a hand along the crystal wall. "This is supposed to be a window. There isn't supposed to be dirt on the other side of it. This whole complex used to be above ground... and focused on the spire."

36 catches Fredric's remark. "Would not there be six legendz?" he asks curiously.

"At least six," Fredric replies. "That particular line is a translation from the Eastern tradition. Though curiously, lines much like it appear in myths of at least three other continents as well."

Wulfgang blinks, "Maybe the whole valley is a giant mirror... Or maybe the lake...."

Cassandra walks lightly, almost silently... in fact, her boots are gone, and she's wearing only slippers. "36... I don't feel the Herald. I don't feel anything here," she says in a whisper. It's still loud in this place, a tomb of old machines and their secrets.

The clockwork shaman wobbles and turns to regard Cassandra for a moment. "Do you feel my prezence in the same fashion?" he asks.

"If only we could clear this earth somehow..." Gerald says. "But that would require a small army, wouldn't it?"

Wulfgang looks to Gerald, "Probably not even a small one."

Cassandra is taken aback by 36's question. "Now that you mention it, no. Not you, nor the boys, nor their pet diamond. Without your help - the dream-walking and the like - I only sense the Herald."

36 thinks a moment. "The young gentlemen zeem to have found a tazk. Perhaps thiz place blocks the.." His voice detunes into static for a moment. "Will you pleaze accompany me to the surface?"

Choi taps at the flooring. "An army to dig it out. An army to build it in the first place. Where are they, then?"

After a few minutes, and with Cassandra's aid, 36's intellectual question is resolved: the girl's spiritual awareness is more focused than it might otherwise be. Nor does it seem tied to the building itself. Satisfied, he descends again.

Gerald glances at Choi, then returns his contemplative gaze to the earthen barrier. "Where are they? In the City, I suspect. In the countryside. In foreign lands. They left this place, and forgot." He looks up, toward where the spire's top must be. "When the spire was uncovered, it must've protected the whole plateau. Now only the last ten feet are aboveground, and it only protects the valley."

Fredric suggests that the explorers work in pairs - Choi with Wulfgang, 36 with Cassandra, and himself with Gerald. And it's Fredric and Gerald who find the next unanswered question...

In some parts of the great clockwork, there are still signs affixed to the walls. They're at head-height and you'd guess a person could read them from a dozen paces in good light. In this darkness it's a bit harder to notice them. The characters are from an unfamiliar alphabet, but they're mixed with iconography that's pretty easy to decipher. One can only go so high here - the top of the hill, presumably - but one can go also go down.

Further down, it seems, than the six levels of catwalks so far discovered... a little exploration turns up another stone shaft, and this one appears to descend further into the earth. Stone steps spiral down along its perimiter. Bundles of rope or cable, thick as a man's wrist, choke the center of the shaft. The cables lead from ports in the walls to a great steel trelliswork that occupies the center of the shaft, and they snake down into the darkness like the roots of a vast mechanical tree.

The cables are innert and unmoving... but perhaps not dead. Like the crystal sphere, absent sunlight, they may only be asleep.

The corridor from the great mirror gallery to this new shaft is about wide enough for two people. No army moved through here; at least, not quickly, and the dust is heavy on the floor.

Gerald peers down the shaft, holding out his lantern as far as he can reach. "Right. Let's have a closer look," he says, marching straightaway down the stairs. By this time, the revolver has been tucked into his belt. There's nothing living down here, and, from the look of it, any potentially dangerous machinery would've long since run out of sunlight ages ago.

You descend the spiralling steps. You make one, two, three, eventually six complete revolutions around the central shaft. Bundles of cable come and go from the central trelliswork.

The lighting is poor and the dust is heavy hear, so you practically trip over the second sphere.

Gerald brushes the dust off the sphere's surface. "Friend of yours?" he asks First of Six, not at all sure their traveling companion can even speak after being in the darkness this long.

First of six is unresponsive, and so is this new sphere. They're of identical substance; indistinguishable, save that the newcomer is about half an inch smaller.

Wulfgang looks, "Maybe we should take both of them up to the curface. Before it gets dark?"

Gerald peers around the shaft. There's another corridor heading toward the lake, but it looks like it goes back a long way. And as Wulfgang points out, the sun will be going down soon. "Good idea. We can have another look tomorrow at first light." He scoops up the second sphere and hands it to Wulfgang. "Let's give this thing something to eat."

"We've still got four hours of daylight," Fredric comments. "And still plenty of fuel."

"True," says Gerald. "But if we let this sphere have that four hours of sunlight it'll wake up all the sooner." He looks down the hallway. "Damn. I don't know which I want to look into first."

"Will the hall remove itzelf in our absence?" 36 asks gently.

Wulfgang looks at Gerald, "I'd rather see what number two, or whever, has to say..."

---

Picking out the path back to the surface is pretty easy. Climbing it is harder. It's almost 100 feet, straight up, through darkness and stale air, and this after a morning of hard labor, after days of travelling through a hostile alien landscape. There's three more hours of daylight topside, but nobody who went below feels much like moving after getting there.

Rodrigo makes up for his lack of spelunking skills, by preparing camp that evening as best he can. "There's no fish in that lake," he complains. "Guess I shouldn't have expected any. So we're still on rations for tonight."

The new sphere - which everyone has taken to Second - seems compatible with First's mirror cradle. Gerald does his best to fit both orbs into the same device and angles it to catch the setting sun.

The spheres wake up only briefly before sunset. They seem to be having a conversation; at least, there's a buzzing noise puncutated by crackles and flashes of light, similar to the exchange between the sphere and the crystal spire in the middle of the lake.

36 kneels by the two spheres and tries to understand the conversation. It moves quickly, and seems to be mostly unidirectional, from First to Second - its experiences above ground.

Second adds some new details to the story - there was a flood. There wasn't a lot of warning; somehow it knows that there was an earthquake many miles to the northeast, and then... a blanket of boiling mud.

After a few minutes, 36 pulls back. His gears tick away in the background, of course, but he seems.. quiet. "Professor Fredric," he asks at last. "A mudzlide wazz the perfect thing to shut off the solar reflection zyztem we obzzerved.. Iz it possible that this was not an accident?"

Fredric scratches his chin. "It is awfully... convenient... for the red life, isn't it? And we did come from the east. But how could anything - even a Spirit," he forces the emphasis, "rewrite the landscape thus?"

"I will azk them zzoon," answers 36.
