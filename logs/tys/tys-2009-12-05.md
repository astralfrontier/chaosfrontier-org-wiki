# University of Tys 2009-12-05

Deep in the northern wilderness, the expedition has breached a buried building that seems to be the origin of the crystal sphere. The exhausted explorers make camp above ground near the building's entrance.

That night, only Gerald dreams...

It's one of those dreams where the boundaries between senses blurs. Gerald awakens - or so he thinks - to the sound of a voice calling his name... but as soon as he opens his eyes, the voice is gone.

In its place, he sees a blue glow. It trails like mist from where he slept, to the stone well leading into the buried building.

On the horizon to the east, Gerald also sees a red glow that seems all too familiar now - and he is certain that it is not the rising sun.

The crystal pylon in the middle of the lake shares the blue miasma. Gerald also notices that the lake itself has a pale green aura... so dim that he only catches it from the corner of his eye.

Gerald rubs his eyes. "Weird..." he mumbles to himself. Natural things do not glow this way, he's sure... but then, he's a long way from the university. He crosses over to Wulfgang's bedroll and shakes his shoulder, to no effect. Shrugging, he picks up a lantern, lights it, and heads into the buried building, following the bluish glow.

The lantern burns brightly in the stone well. The light plays across the gears and mirrors in the machine gallery, making chaotic mirages that dance like birds of fire in the darkness. Gerald follows the mist to the deeper tunnel, and would swear more than once that he sees the fat bundles of cables moving in the corner of his eye... only to cease when he looks directly at them.

The blue mist is a reliable guide. If Gerald ever loses sight of it, he can hear it calling his name. When he sees it, the lantern seems redundant; it illuminates nearby machines as brightly and evenly as starlight. It leads Gerald in one direction... down.

Gerald soon comes to the final landing of the well of cables. There's an impression in the dust on the floor, where the second crystal sphere was found. Here the blue mist seems to concentrate for a moment, hovering and gathering in the spot until it takes on the likeness of the thing, before losing shape again and flowing down a low, narrow hall - barely big enough for a man to stand in.

And here the passage seems to end, ten meters from the final landing, in ankle-deep drifted dust, at what Gerald can only describe as a vault door. The fitted stone slabs that make up this place curve smoothly at the end into a rectangular frame, occupied by a heavy metallic slab.

The slab is featureless in lantern light - but the must crawls along the floor, and slides up over the metal in a thick layer. Then... the mist seems to sink into the surface of the thing, and yet Gerald can still see the blue tracery glowing within. It shows a complex, interlocking, irregular grid, like the streets of some great city or the veins and pores of some great leaf viewed under a microscope.

The mist still calls. "Gerald," it says. "Gerald Linkletter. Come home."

Gerald sets the lantern down on the floor and walks up to the slab, tracing the blue glow as it stretches along the wall. "So... what is this _for_?" he mumbles to himself. "Is this the plans for this building?" He looks for reference points... either geographical or mental... that will help hiim understand what he sees.

By looking closely at the pattern, Gerald can see that it's divided into four layers - one spot in particular glows brightly, and it seems to mark the boundary between the first and second layers. As Gerald traces the pattern on the slab, the lights react. The blue glow becomes brighter and follows his fingertips. Something ripples in the trailing lights, patterns of swirls and whorls that seem quite familiar.

Gerald draws his hand back sharply sa the light flows around him... then laughs in delight and begins running it along the slab. "Now we're getting somewhere!" he enthuses, while the back of his mind still tries to work out what seems so familiar.

The lights eventually coalesce into a ripple around Gerald's palm. The young mechanician suddenly feels a tingling in the skin of his fingertips, followed my a moment of numbess. The lights freeze for a moment, then something that might be lettering scrolls across the door, from the right to the left. There seem to be four different symbols in the set, and they match some of the symbols seen on the unreadable signage on the walls in the machine gallery.

The symbols accelerate, until Gerald can only see a blurred blue band across the center of the diagram. The rest of the thing remains, and Gerald has time to study it; whatever it is, it's a very complex machine, and it is divided into four layers. This door might be one small part of it, between one layer and the next.

Abruptly, the lights surge into a flash, and when Gerald is able to see again, the heavy door is gone. The blue mist remains; in fact, the chamber beyond seems to be suffused with it.

Gerald grins. "Now there's a thing," he says. "Knock, knock," he says, rapping lightly on the doorframe before plunging into the mist.

The corridor continues for a long distance and takes about five minutes to walk end to end. Gerald is aware that he's heading back towards the lake - perhaps even exactly towards the crystal pylon at its center. The blue mist coalesces into patterns on the wall as Gerald passes, following him as guides or possibly even pets... until the corridor reaches its end.

There may have been a door here, but it's gone now. The floor is free of dust so it's hard to tell when the last time someone might have walked this way... but Gerald hardly cares as he steps out in the vast chamber that must be beneath the lake, and sees what lives within.

The pattern on the door described a vast machine, and this is its second layer; the chamber is as wide as a city block and arcs overhead, fifty or sixty feet high. The entire space is filled with a blue glow from hundreds of small creatures made from crystal, or perhaps even just made from light itself. Some are small and spiderlike; others are larger and move like jungle animals brought back from the southern continent. Some even fly. They move alone or in ordered formations of dozens.

The creatures dart to and fro among other unmoving machines of every size from the proverbial breadbox to small houses. Across every one, the blue mist runs like rain down the windows of a cathedral. As Gerald suspects, at the center of it all, is the crystal pylon, glowing bright as noonday.

It is only now that Gerald realizes that his lantern is not providing any illumination, and the oil flame - admittedly feeble by comparison - has no effect on the brightness or color of the things around him.

Gerald puts out the lantern, to save oil, and strides toward one of larger machines. "What did you do, I wonder?" he says softly to it. Patting it lightly on one of its surfaces, he gravitates toward the crystal pylon.

To his surprise, Gerald hears an answer. It is muted and comes from deep within the machine. "You are known to us," it says. "We built this place, long ago, from native stone and the light of stars. Here we remain, though our job is done."

Gerald stops in his tracks and turns back. "When you say 'this place', what do you mean, exactly? This city of machines and crystal creatures? Or something more?"

"More," it whispers. "Much more. An entire world in which to live and breathe... approach and be illuminated.

Gerald's eyes widen. "An entire world..." he says softly, and steps toward the machine, seeking some manner of ingress.

To Gerald's amazement, the crystal yields to his touch. For a sickening moment he feels like he's falling, yet he doesn't move. He simply floats within the substance of the thing. "An entire world in which to live and breathe," the voice repeats. The image beyond the pylon slips slowly towards the roof; then Gerald realizes, he is descending after all, though he cannot feel it.

Gerald is uncertain of the distance when he enters what must be the third layer - the pylon still in its center, and Gerald within the pylon. This chamber is even larger than the last, and Gerald is certain that it's a city, meant for people like him. The blue glow beyond the walls is not as dense as in the chamber above; it flows on the buildings, but there are far fewer machine-creatures. "A nursery to nurture another generation," the voice continues. "And every generation must eventually leave its nursery."

The pylon again passes through the ultimate floor of the chamber, and Gerald with it. He emerges at last into the fourth part of the great machine - a spherical chamber, the bottom half of which is filled with a blue-green fluid, glowing so brightly as to blind him. "Your arrival has been anticipated," the voice whispers. "Now be illuminated..."

"Man, the guys are never gonna believe this," Gerald mutters to himself, still grinning maniacally. And as he approaches the surface of the... water?... well, whatever it is, he takes a deep breath. Just in case.

Gerald slips noiselessly beneath the surface of the fluid, and... time... stops...

At the expedition camp, morning arrives, and Gerald is missing.

Wulfgang yawns awake, and looks over at Gerald's bedroll. "Hey sleepyhead..." Wulfgang begins, then realises that he isn't there. He stands up, and looks down, prodding the empty bedroll with his toe. "Anyone seen Gerald?"

36 rouses himself to consciousness. A humming noise comes from his chest, and then an abrupt crunch as a pair of gears slide out of alignment. Unsteadily the mechanical man gets to his feet, clacking his iron fingers together and watching them go askew. "Mr. Gerald iz not here?" he asks.

Fredric organizes everyone into pairs to search for the missing student, seeming intent on searching above ground, but Cassandra is the first to point out the obvious. "We know where he's gone. There's only one place worth going." She makes a stabbing motion towards the ground.

Wulfgang gestures down the hole, "Lead the way, then." He beams an obnoxious smile at the girl.

"That iz not the only pozzibility," 36 points out. "If he waz taken - or went - to meet with the red life, he might have gone zomewhere elze." Nevertheless he follows the group's direction.

Cassandra scowls at Wulfgang. "If you insist on allowing a fair maiden rescue your friend, then I'm game! I'll be sure to tell him all the perils I faced on the way."

Wulfgang's obnoxious smile doesn't flinch an inch, "I just figured you would be eager to fetch your beau." He shrugs, "Of course I would never dream of sending you alone." He trails off, givign slightly nervous glances at Fredric or Choi.

36 tromps toward the entrance. He reaches Cassandra, and his head swivels to face her. "Mr. Fredric's teachingz on ladylike behavior have taken root," he hums in amusement. But he doesn't stop heading underground.

Choi gives a small shake of his head, and 'rescues' the youths by bringing over their weapons. "Shall we get on with it, m'lords?" he asks. Not waiting for an answer, he herds the two ahead, catching up to 36 as the little machine-man reaches the first landing of the well.

Wulfgang shrugs, and heads down the hole again, "You know Choi, My father probably didn't need to leave detailed instructions... just one sheet with the words 'No Fun' on it, eh?" He shrugs, as he disapears down the ladder.

"Someday you will laugh at this," Choi replies in his mild, laconic way. "Or cry. You will choose which."

The dust is heavy in a lot of places, and was disturbed by yesterday's foray. However, there's no reason why it should be disturbed beyond the point in the cable well where the second sphere was found - and sure enough, there's a trail of footprints leading beyond, and into a narrow corridor at the bottom of the well.

A change in the pattern of the stone walls of the shows where a door may once have been. Now there is just a six-inch thick ring of some unfamiliar metal inlaid into the wall. It marks the boundary between the dust of the well and a near-pristine floor beyond... pristine, except for bootprints that must be Gerald's, that continue down the corridor.

There's no light or markings anywhere, save for what the expedition has brought with them: oil lamps and carbine miner's helmets that brightly illuinate the granite walls for a dozen paces ahead, before being swallowed up by inky blackness.

The corridor opens into a huge gallery. It smells stale and a bit damp; the miner's lights pick out large, blocklike structures all over the place, some as large as houses. There are also derilect machine-creatures all over the place, ranging in size from a few inches across to the size of a man. They litter the floor like unburied metal bones, chewed up and left by long years of neglect. The only other source of light seems to come from somewhere near the center of the vast chamber; a pale echo of sunlight coming down the crystal pylon from the exposed tip. If not for the utter darkness of the place it would be undetectable.

Gerald's footprints lead almost directly towards the center of the chamber, and the crystal pylon. His discarded lantern is nearby. Fredric picks it up. "Oh, hell," he says. "If he dropped this, how could he even see?"

Wulfgang takes a look around, "I'd hate to be around when all of this comes back to life." He looks at his comrands, and sees noone stepping forward.. he strades confidently to the middle of the room, looking back at Fredric, "I'm sure he found a way..." He looks up at the pylon, examining closely.

36 picks his way through some of the machinery here, idly curious.

Wulfgang discovers that Gerald's footprints lead right to the pylon... and stop. Nothing leads away. The pylon seems solid enough; pressing his face against it, Wulfgang can just make out a distorted image of sunlight coming from above... and something else coming from below, a blue-green light of a type that he doesn't associate with the sky.

36, who has made a thorough observeration of all flora and fauna available to him, finds nothing familiar among the mechanical remains. There are bits and pieces that certainly have something in common with the natural world. 36 finds legs, claws, cilia, even a few that might have moved like snakes. But if these are living things, they aren't like the other life of the World, because he also finds wheels and tracks. Neither, for that matter, are they like 36 himself - the little shaman's body is obviously a man-made thing, but these things are sculpted from perfect materials with uncanny workmanship.

Wulfgang looks carefully at where Gerald's tracks end. "I see." He says, with no comprehension at all. He attempts to stand himself right in Gerald's tracks, his body looking around for teh source of his friend's abductor left, right, up, down, etc...

Wulfgang feels... something... when he stands in Gerald's footprints, leaning against the pylon. His palms feel numb, and out of the corners of his eyes he catches sight of something that moves... just a flash of movement that shouldn't be down in this inky blackness.

Wulfgang looks quickly at something that escapes his notice out the corner of his eye. He shrugs, and wanders over to the rest of the group.

At the same time, 36 invites the local spirits to speak to him. A loud crackle of noise comes from his speaker grill... in it, a few noises that may or may not be words... 'known to us'...

"Down," says 36 at last. "There iz something below."

"Right," Fredric says. "Umm... how?"

Wulfgang says, "I bet Choi brought some shovels."

"We muzt find our friend," says 36 - both aloud, and to the spiritual presence here. "Pleaze assist uz."

A loud noise, like a door banging open, sounds through the cavern. It seems to come from a direction where nobody's been yet - if the tunnel back to the surface is north, then this might be somewhere to the southwest.

More noise from 36's speaker. Embedded in it, another possible word: 'follow...'

"Thank you," the mechanical man replies. His gears engage and he starts walking, although there's a slight twitch in his left arm.

At Fredric's suggestion, the group splits into two groups: Choi and Wulfgang in one direction, Fredric, Cassandra, and 36 in the other.

Sound travels oddly down here, and one can't help but trip over cables and machinery. The carbide flames flicker, casting errie, malevolent shadows from all the disabled machine-beasts. This place was does not seem like it was built with people in mind. But 36 and Wulfgang seem to have a knack for navigating through it: 36, from the whispers of the spirits of this place, and Wulfgang, from something else... just a knowledge of what makes sense to a machine.

Though the two groups start out going in different directions, they converge on the same spot: a small metal shack, with a large roll-up metal door in the front: shockingly primitive, given the surroundings. Wulfgang and 36 spot each other from a good thirty feet away, followed closely by Cassandra. The two adults arrive a moment later.

Wulfgang looks at 36, "I believe this is your department, sir."

Wulfgang gestures to the metal door, too.

36 plods forward, giving the door a try.

The rollup door does, eventually, give way, with a groan of metal and a shower of dust. It hasn't moved in years; Gerald couldn't have come this way. The room within is some kind of workshop. The wall to the left is lined with a workbench and several workstools, though no tools are present. Three cylindrical chambers abut the back wall, each with a pair of sliding doors set into the front. The right wall is occupied by metal lockers. Each is larger than a man, and all but one hangs open on its hinges.

Wulfgang looks around, "Well, this seems sot of obvious.." He states, and walks, again confidently, walks over to the closed cylender.

The doors in the front of the chambers are translucent; two are stuck tight, but the middle one opens easily, revealing... more stairs, descending into the darkness. Unlike the wells in the machine gallery, which were arranged in spirals, these simply alternate left and right sides with landings every fifteen feet or so, as in the taller buildings in town.

The expedition passes one... two... three landings before noticing that the lighting has improved. There are strips set into the walls, just above head-height, and now they glow with a pale white light. The explorers reach a doorway on the fifth landing, and by then, it's bright enough to see unaided. A door leads out of the stairwell here, and there are three more floors below.

Wulfgang calls up the stairs to the rest of the crew, "We should all probably take an exit, and then meet back here after 10 minutes or so. That way, we can cover more ground. Everything here seems dead anyway...." He reasons, then starts heading down to the lowest level.
