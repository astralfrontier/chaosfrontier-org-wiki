# University of Tys 2009-12-19

Elsewhere in the city, Gerald is in communion with... something. It appears as a swirling mass of blue-green. The spirit of this place, perhaps. In Gerald's altered state, he intuitively understands that he's suspended in the heart and soul of this place. The young man has always had more understanding of machines than of nature or shamanism, and perhaps that is why the green retreats, leaving a lake of bright blue light.

The light resolves into a complex pattern, at once wormlike and angular... like the locking mechanism on the door that led Gerald here, but many times more complex. And it speaks to him...

"Be enlightened," it says. "We told you that we built this place. We built more, as well..."

Gerald begins to see, as through another's eyes. Somehow he understand that they are eyes of a machine; but not like 36. 36 is alive; these machines are... something else. Something very patient. The first were quite like the crystal spheres: immortal beings of diamond and memory, and they lived on the warm breath of stars and stones.

For the first time, Gerald understands some truths of the physical universe in a way that his tutors, clumsy, limited beings that they are, have only been able to allude to and hint upon. Energy takes on all forms; and all forms are energy, tamed and made constant. "The world is made of fire," he hears a voice say. "But that is not all..."

There is a relationship between energy and knowledge... information... plans. Patterns that lived in crystal shards for ... a length of time he cannot comprehend. The plan for an entire world, that came here, from somewhere else. The plan became a living thing. "Through fire and stone, wind and rain, we made this place," the voice says.

Gerald sees how it began: the plan made machines, and they explored the world. A red world, with a poisoned red sky. The first memories of the machines are sparse, slow, primitive, almost comprehensible...

Gerald can barely take it all in. He is reminded of the way a hick from a small country town would feel if they were dropped right into the University, and realizes that he's in a similar situation, except on an even larger scale. And yet... and yet... somehow, even the parts he can't understand, he feels absolutely confident that he _could_ understand, given time.

The memories accelerate, become too fast to follow. Gerald understands what he's seeing, though: the red world becoming green; the machine plan coming to life. It's painfully bright... Gerald feels something within his mind and his bones - sees a glimpse of something, a twisted, multicolored ladder or millions of rungs. Then it's gone, and the voice returns.

"We knew you would return," it says; there's approval in the voice, a note of expectation fulfulled. "The time is coming for the cycle to repeat. Be enlightened."

Gerald now sees something in the pattern of lights around him. It's not just a sphere - it's a globe. The World. Information once flowed around it, but it becomes dimmer as the world becomes green. Six points are the brightest of all: one at the center of each major continent, making five, and a sixth upon the vast ice at the bottom of the world.

Elsewhere in the underground city, the explorers are making their way through the chambers of an abandoned building. The air is stale, though there's surprisingly little dust. The walls are mostly the same precision-cut granite of the upper galleries, though increasingly they are made of another substance, more waxy but just as smooth.

Most of the floors of this building are divided into smaller rooms; and some of them have bed-frames or beds in them. They all seem to be similarly sized - for a single person, or two at a real pinch. The matresses, where they remain, are heavy and thick - as luxurious as the bedchamber of any of the Lords of the city. The metallic frames can be found in positions from seated upright to fully flat, though there's no joints or obvious way to move them.

The outer walls have windows, but they show only inky blackness beyond - except on one side. The front side of the building overlooks a hemispherical well, a hundred feet wide and about fifty feet deep, which is ringed by low stone benches in dozens of tiers. The well surrounds the crystal spire, which rises from the central stage - at that depth, it appears ten feet thick. It tapers as it rises, until it disappears into the living rock of the cieling.

The spire glows with a pale blue light, just enough to illuminate the amphitheater and the front face of the building.

Wulfgang wanders close to a wall, as a feeling aobut this place strikes him. As his companions watch on, he seems to loose 'sight' of them, if that is even the proper word. He looks at one of the columns. He pounds his fist against it, "Hey. Wake up. Where's you take my friend?"

Choi watches Wulfgang carefully, but does not interfere. A minute passes before he says anything. "Did that help?" he asks.

The wall, one of the waxy ones, gives all appearances of refusing to answer. Then, out of a corner of his eye, Wulfgang sees a tracery of lights, like fireflies in a jar, moving where he struck it. It appears, fades, appears again, fades again. As it fades, it seems to flow towards the windows overlooking the amphitheater.

It's so dim, the lights might not have been there at all; Choi gives no sign of having seen them.

A floor away, 36, Fredric, and Cassandra are exploring. Some of the rooms near the middle of the floor are walled with inch-thick sheets of pure transparent crystal - maybe not diamond, but something really hard. Within are rows of empty vertical tubes, tightly spaced and each about a meter across.

The little metal man has been tromping slowly along, making the human parts of his group wait for him. Now, however, he seems to be in advance of them. "Oh," he says out loud, with no particular sign or prompting for it. "Thiz plaze is daydreaming. Zo then... Mr. Fredric, Miss Cassandra, pleaze continue on without me."

Cassandra hasn't relaxed the grip on her sword, but it seems more habit than worry. Fredric has been prodding the walls, floors, and fixtures with pocket tools and a magnifying glass, muttering all the while about how poor the light is. 36's announcement takes him by surprise. "Umm... well, if you need a moment, then. Cassandra, please help me find something... I don't know... portable. Something I can sample." The academic sighs. "It must be diamond - whole sheets of it. Fascinating, but if I can't scratch it, I can't prove it!"

36 has a few minutes to himself, in an empty room, with only the faint blue glow out the window for company. The little machine-man can stand still, quiet his limbs, slow his gears... sleeping, like the city beyond sleeps.

It turns out, even a sleeping city can dream...

---

This was once a place of healing. It daydreams of the people who came and went - and they were people. Strangely dressed, speaking unfamiliar languages, but people, for sure. It recognizes 36's friends as the same type of being, and reminisces about humans it used to know.

Its period of occupation was shockingly short. From the time this place came to be, until it was abandoned, was less than two human lifetimes. A few people who were young when it was built, spent their lifetimes here caring for their fellows, and then moved on to somewhere else in old age.

It was part of the plan. People are meant to live in the air and under the sky. Once they were ready, they moved on, and this place... went to sleep. Now it dreams at the speed of stone. Little disturbs its slumber - a slight bump, centuries ago, when a mudslide covered the valley above.

What does it take to wake a city? The city does seem to be waiting for something. A short list of conditions, also on the geologic scale: major movements of the earth. Shifts in the currents of the seas. Objects in the sky. In its daydreams it imagines these things.

And one other condition... it imagines a return of people. A particular type of person. The city will know the descendants of its old masters.

In response to this, 36 offers a dream that may be of interest to it: the red life, spreading its tendrils out from the plateau. In his counter-vision, the diaspora of people find themselves chased, pursued, caught - like Cassandra. Her pain and fear of the red life are an elemental force and one that 36 has experienced first-hand. _You must wake up. We need you._

Suddenly, the lights come on...

The next thing 36 is aware of, Gerald, Fredric, Choi, and Wulfgang are standing in front of him. The building is now brightly lit; the cieling tiles are emitting a pleasant, even, flicker-free light. The amphitheater outside is now similarly lit - the floors and benches glow with the same even light, and meter-wide glowing globes float along the aisles and alleys. The rest of the city is still dark.

The crystal spheres, which have been anemic, sleepy passengers since their discovery, now float of their own accord. One of them - probably First - buzzes, making a facsimile of speech. "Follow us," it says.

36 twists his head about, listening to the soft groan of gears. "Thank you," he buzzes.

Fredric stares wide-eyed at 36. "What did you _do_?"

36 looks blank for a few moments. "I zpoke to it," he explains.

Gerald is wide-eyed, wearing a somewhat manic grin. "Oh hi guys. Glad you could catch up. Oh _man_, the things I've..." He's cut off by the sphere. "Never mind. Let's let these guys lead the tour. I'll tell you later."

---

The spheres lead the explorers to the center of the amphitheater. crystal pylon glows with an internal blue light. Up close, it's easy to see that even this isn't the bottom. The clear walls of the crystal clearly descend at least another thirty feet into the earth. That might be the end of it, though, because a dark shadow is visible within the object at that depth: four limbs, body, head. Human-shaped. Gerald-shaped.

"You have learned to zpirit walk," observes 36, looking at Gerald.

Gerald peers at the shape. "Looks like it. That's _me_ down there, I guess, and the me over here is a dream with you guys. Thought you showed up awfully suddenly." He scratches his head. "Not sure it's me doing it, tell you the truth."

Wulfgang looks down, "So, are we going to get him back? I mean, in one piece and such." He points down to the shadowy figure, as if his subject wern't obvious by context.
