# University of Tys 2010-03-27

It is late evening in the Chancellor's Office, on the top floor of the University Manor. Several pots of coffee and heavy breakfast tea have gone from full to empty while telling the tale of the 'Steam Expedition' to the continental interior. After listening carefully to the story, Bandwul, the Chancellor, has just announced that Cassandra's possession is not a unique case.

Cassandra hides her surprise badly. "What? No! I mean... what do you mean?"

Wulfgang perks up as well, looking at Mr. Bandwul. Not only who.. but how did he get this information...

Bandwul pulls a thick notebook from his desk. It looks recently made, but quite well-thumbed for that. "When Miss Cassandra ran off after you lot, Captain Teague - her father - was understandably... perturbed. He sent a lieutenant to the University to get some answers. I gave him my personal guarantee that his daughter would return safe and sound." The Chancellor glares at Fredric for a moment. "Which, fortunately for all of us, was a true statement."

Fredric shifts for a moment, but then glares right back. "Everyone was within their rights, and decorum was maintained."

Alec scratches his chin. "Possessions. What are you lot doing about it, then?" he asks finally.

Bandwul shrugs, relaxes. "Mostly, we just catalog them. Since all the witnesses - you fellows - were off in the wilderness, that meant our library." He opens the notebook. "So the least and the most I could do about it was tally up similar cases of Possession we've recorded. There's been... quite a few."

"Yeah, but.." Alec's face contorts a little bit as he tries to put word to thought. "Now that you _know_, what are you doing about it?"

Wulfgang looks to Alec. "Most likely the answer is the same, of course. Us."

Wulfgang looks to Bandwul, "Where are these cases coming from? ANy in the city?"

"There's a few cases of possession here every year," Bandwul replies. "And we hear about a few more from shamans that come to the University for their own reasons. Per capita, it seems more common outside the city than in, but our records are only as old as the University - about one hundred years." He flips a few pages. "Cassandra's case is the most severe recorded, and the first case to mention the 'Herald' by name. Earlier Possessions have involved similar symptoms, however... strange weather in the days before, nightmares lasting weeks or months, visions of monsters. Often they go away on their own. Sometimes a Shaman intervenes, performing some sort of ritual involving herbs, immersion in rivers and streams, a real bag of tricks." He looks over at Alec. "No offense intended. Shamansim is inherently unpredictable, to scientific eyes."

Bandwul slides the notebook over towards Wulfgang. The page has a newspaper clipping pasted onto it - a somewhat lurid account of an exorcism on a farm just outside the city wall, five years ago. "Since you ask, start with that one."

Wulfgang looks back to Bandwul, "Between Alec and 36, I have found shamanism to be fairly reliable." He smiles, "Reliable enough to deliver Ms. Cassandra safely through to here, anyway." He pauses and looks at the paper in front of him, reading it over.

"Perhaps," Bandwul grants. "So many discoveries are based on patterns that went un-noticed for years, even though the evidence was right in front of us. This might be one of them."

"There've always been stories of odd things, yeah," Gerald comments. "Just like the legends of where people came from. Now that we've got a framework for understanding them, it's time to revisit the stories."

The newspaper story tells, in rather sensational language, the story of a family matron on a small farm who encountered a ghost during a storm in late fall. The storm was rather violent, and it was claimed that it smashed a barn, scattered the family's horses, and blown over several might oaks. Bandwul has thoughtfully attached an insurance report on the facing page - a claim to the County Office for a much more modest amount of damage, witnessed and endorsed by a government clerk. The storm seems genuine, however, and is corroborated by a log entry from the Fleets' Observatory.

Over a period of three weeks, the afflicted Matron had a number of 'visitations', fainting spells, troubled dreams, sleepwalking, and moments of hysteria. The article depicts evil spirits as being physically present in the family manor, though Bandwul notes that nobody else in the family actually saw anything during the hysteric episodes.

The matron visited a hospital in the City, though not the University. Herbal remedies were tried, but were of a rather crude nature that just served to keep the woman anaesthetized. Finally, after two months of Possession, a shaman showed up at their door and performed an exorcism - the ritual itself being little more than an hours-long meditation with the family in their Ancestral Chapel. The woman recovered soon after.

Bandwul has underlined a particular paragraph in pencil, where the woman describes one of her sleepwalking visions: 'I stood in the high cupola of our manor... I saw a tide of demons and foul beasts, crashing out of the forest and bubbling up from deep wells in the earth. They devoured or corrupted all that they touched and the world turned black in their wake.'

Bandwul gestures at Wulfgang. "Some of the really interesting entries come to us from overseas. As you know, we put naturalists on ships bound for far ports - that was where Fredric was, prior to supervising your expedition."

Fredric rolls his eyes. "Yes. Then I had three whole weeks in civilization."

Bandwul ignores this dig, politely failing to point out that Fredric volunteered. The Chancellor continues. "As unreliable as folklore is, there are accounts from naturalists' journals, speaking to shamans and local leaders overseas, that seem to name the Herald, though somewhat imprecisely. Yes, that one." He points to a page that Wulfgang has reached.

"One of the more believable accounts," Bandwul says. "The son of a Western missionary, on some island off the coast of the southern continent. The boy didn't speak a word of the local language - except during his fits. The name he gave his tormenter was the word for 'Great Messenger' in the local language."

This case didn't end well; the Mission was accompanied by a ranking Knight of some obscure Western order. He blamed a local shaman for cursing the boy and murdered the man. The boy did not recover until months later, when the Mission was abandoned, and everyone returned home to the Western kingdoms.

"So how _long_ has a Herald been cropping up in these stories?" asks Gerald. "I'm getting the impression that Possession in general has been turning up for quite some time - but is the Herald a new element?"

"That account is twenty years old, told to one of our professors by the alleged Knight himself. As to how far back it goes..." Bandwul points at the notebook. "We've only been paying attention for a hundred years. If some old man told the old Lord a ghost story that he heard as a child, then the event could go back twice as far. But would you trust it?" Bandwul shakes his head. "I've found potential matches going back at least that far. Reliable ones... perhaps only fifty years or so. I do not know if they are becoming more frequent, or we've simply collected more of them lately."

"Anyway..." Bandwul looks at the clock. "It's late. You've all done well - very well - to go as far as you did, and come back with such... interesting... observations. But whatever is going on, has been going on for a very long time. Return to your studies, and we'll work out what all this means in the coming weeks."

Rooms in the Young Men's Dormitory are just the way they were left - in fact, it doesn't seem that anybody has even opened the door to Wulfgang or Gerald's rooms for over a month. For some reason, the porters expected Cassandra and Alec to be living in the city; but after a few moments of confusion, they simply assign them to the vacant Concierge's Apartment.

Wulfgang puts away his belongings as they are brought in by the porter, admiring himself in the mirror. Less pale, more toned, the young man has changed much, given the short time, relatively, that he has been gone.

Alec introduces Cassandra to a few of the more curious boys who see fit to introduce themselves. During that time, he attempts to impress upon all of them two indisputable facts: first, that she has a brother, and second, that both of them are armed.

For Gerald, it's as if he were moving into the dorms for the first time, all over again. After the strangeness of the journey into the Hinterlands, it almost seems as if the University is now the strange place.

All of the students are curious about a collection of their peers showing up in the middle of the term; however, all of them are also fatigued, at the end of a long day in the middle of a week. The last few gawkers soon clatter away into the dorm halls, and night comes to the University.

Morning follows night. After weeks in the back country, it's something of a shock to awaken indoors, to the sound of people instead of wildlife... or worse. It's equally strange that someone has made breakfast, and there's no need to strike camp; also strange when nearly all of the students depart for classes at the eighth bell, leaving the dorms mostly empty.

Some of the students, recognizing Gerald and Wulfgang, pepper them with questions over breakfast. The rumor mill has been active. Cassandra is either a foreign Princess or Wulfgang's wife or some kind of Western holy woman. Alec is various her husband or her mute-mongoloid bodyguard. Some people heard that Wulfgang got eaten by bears. Others think it was Gerald.

Wulfgang quips, "Oh, it was definately Gerald who got eaten by bears. We just dressed 36 up to look like him."

Gerald does his best to mime the inimitable accent. "Yezzz, that izzzzz correct."

Alec stays to himself and pokes at breakfast curiously. He's frankly a little baffled about what he's supposed to _do_ here, and the noisy crowd doesn't help.

Wulfgang looks at Gerald, "I wonder what classes we were signed up for in our absense." WUlfgang, really, is hinting at the possibility that no such thing occured.

As if in response to Wulfgang's comment about classes, a Porter brings over two stacks of mail, tied with twine and small paper labels that read 'STENTZ' and 'LINKLETTER'. Most of them are form letters from the registration office, reminding the boys that they aren't required to register for class while on field assignment. Several more are requests for confirmation of the progress of the field assignment. It seems they were sent every week. So were notices from the payroll office, which apparently paid a small sum to the boys' families for their labor, before billing them a much larger sum for their attendance. There are also a few letters from home, lost in the sea of paper.

Wulfgang looks at Gerald, "I guess we sould have left a forwarding address..."

Alec has been loitering about, and now scratches his chin before speaking. "So, hey. What are my responsibilities as student here? Any watches or details I need?"

Wulfgang shrugs at Alec, "It's touch to say. Most students are either enrolled in classes, or attached to some research project or another. I'm honestly not sure where you would rank, though I doubt that I see classes in your future." He shrugs, "I'd be happy to accompany you to the registrar tomorrow so we can puzzle that out, but I best go see my father. I'm surprised he hasn't sown up at the gates yet."

Alec blinks and squints. He doesn't get it, clearly. "Alright."

Cassandra pipes up. "If I understand what Gerald and Wulfgang have told of this place, you sign up for classes, then every day, you get up early, they feed you too well, then you sit in lectures for the next four hours." She grins. "And evil professors give tests on paper at uncertain intervals, and if you fail them, you have to do it all over again next year. So it's kind of like being a Cadet, with more reading and writing involved."

Alec shakes his head uncertainly. "Well fine, that's fine, but that's not what I'm asking. I mean what do you guys _do_?"

"Uh... we learn. Study?" Gerald says, finding himself at a loss. "Well, in my case, I'd started out with the idea of becoming an expert in clockwork and machinery. Of course, _now_ I'm going to be talking to Frederic about a research project."

Wulfgang blinks, "Test's aren't that evil. It's more akin to training exercises. Something you have to do, but don't always want too." He looks curiously at Alec, as if asking a deep philosophical question, "You mean before we became impromptu naturalists?" He thinks on this for a second, "I'm learning politics, diplomacy, that sort of thing." He generalizes, waving his hand.

"Oh. You're apprenticing." This makes Alec's world fall into place. All is well. "Alright, so I'll watch you guys work for awhile. I finished with that."

The first stop is Fredric's office. The room is high and narrow, just wide enough for the desk and two big rows of floor-to-cieling bookshelves crammed with papers and curios and a thin patina of dust. The professor looks more rested than he did yesterday, but still somewhat haunted and worried. He makes an effort to calm down when his students arrive. "Oh, Gerald. Alec." He offers seats - battered wooden chairs facing the just as battered desk. "It seems we've come back in mid-term. I expect you're still trying to figure out how to fill the time. I must confess I'm stuck for options myself. I still hadn't unpacked from the last trip..." he trails off. "What can I do for you?"

"Well, I _do_ have an idea for how to fill the time," Gerald says, shuffling his feet. "You see... in the crystal city, I..." He scratches his head. "I guess you could say I was exposed to a... new metaphysics. And I'd like to have the opportunity to develop it."

Fredric leans against a bookshelf. "Yes... there is that. You know, we've seen all sorts of people claiming all sorts of strange powers. Isn't it odd that only shamanism is at all repeatable?" He folds his arms. "But we've seen strange things with our own eyes. So perhaps you're really on to something. Very well. We can build a plan of study around this, and I can beg space from the mechanical lab." He hands over a blank notebook. "Start with a survey of sorcerous tales in the library. We can work out the experiments and specifics later."

Choi shows up at the dormitories shortly after Gerald departs. While the elder Stentz hasn't been battering down the gates, he's clearly sent his instructions. Choi holds up a small piece of paper on family letterhead. "It said, 'Open Immediately'," he says. "I decided 'Immediately' means 'When you look ready.' You look ready now." A hackney cab whisks the two to the Stentz estate, just outside the eastern wall.

Wulfgang looks at Choi. "I must say I appriciate that." Wulfgang gulps, and enters the estate, his eyes takin gin the familiar sites for the first time in a while. HIs father was always a worrier. He suffers little of the servants and other helpers, seeking out his father as expediantly as possible.

Wulfgang's father and mother are in the drawing room. Both practically cheer as Wulfgang enters, though his mother proves the swifter of her two. She throws an energetic hug around her son that leaves no doubt about how much she was worried. "When your father sent you on that trip I was sure that you'd be eaten by some _horrible_ monster. And things we've heard! And is it true there was a _girl_ with you? All that way with no bed or bath?" She sounds like she could go on for hours; the elder Stentz rolls his eyes.

Wulfgang was, of course, expecting this. He assumes his normal henpecked voice. Inherited from his father, of course. "I've had a bath when I got back. There was a girl along, nothing happened. Gerald was eaten by a bear, but we replaced him with a mechanical man." He smiles at this last, and looks at his father, "You'll be happy to hear," He begins, assumign a more upbeat, but still somewhat put upon voice, "That the steam power boat behaved itself admirably on both sea and land."

The elder Stentz quirks his brows at this. "Really? How curious. Lisbet! Let the boy breathe. Didn't you say a dozen times how much we should have tea together when he arrives?" He gently extracts Wulfgang from the wave of matronly concern.

"Oh, really, father," she says, with mock indignity. "This is our son, not one of your agents! But you are correct. Pursue your conspiracy while I adjourn to the pantry."

Somewhere in the shuffle, Choi has disappeared, leaving Wulfgang and his father alone. "Well. Got a few minutes. I am glad to see you back. I gather we may have sent you further into the wolves' den than I thought. Sorry about that, but I guess it did no harm. So how did it go?"

Wulfgang nods, "Nothing that was as bad as all that, honestly. And Choi was much help. Thank you for that." He stammers out the words, as much as it might hurt him to do so. "It went as well as can be expected. Well, probably better than that actually. It went well."

"I've heard a few things," Stentz says, settling into an overstuffed chair, and motioning for Wulfgang to do the same. "Honestly, I envy you. When I was just a bit older than you, I went with a Fleet to the Eastern Empire. The weather turned bad and I was seasick for half the trip. When we got into port it was all I could do to stand up at roll call." Still, the older smiles. "Later trips were better. Even fun. I never get to do that sort of thing anymore. So..." He leans back. "What's this about a boat that works on land?"

Wulfgang smiles, "Interested? You remember my friend Gerald? Maybe I'll bring him by sometime. Given his interests in this trip, you two may have a lot to talk about." Wulfgang strugs, "I wasn't that involved really. It was pretty helpful, however..." And he leaves it at that.

Stentz sighs, shakes his head. "You're too modest. I'm sure you had your nose right in the action, whatever it was, and know as much as your machinist friend. Anyway. You've gotten folks talking about steam-vessels. Hasn't made the floor of Parliament yet, but it's certainly made the tea room. Ah! Speaking of which..." Wulfgang's mother returns, followed by a servant and a trolley bearing a tea service.

Wulfgang spends the morning telling his tale to his parents, and in early afternoon, a cab brings him back to the University. Choi accompanies him for the return trip, and says a few words before leaving. "Father says, the school is safe. I say, the boy knows how to find trouble. So father says, before boy finds trouble, he calls Choi." The big man grins. "Scary foreigner standing in back of room, is cheap, powerful negotiating tool." He gets back into the cab. "Hitting something costs extra."

Alec finds it's pretty easy to get an appointment with Bandwul... but the wait is never less than fifteen minutes, even though he can see that the Chancellor's calendar is clearly empty most afternoons. And precisely fifteen minutes later, he's shown into the Chancellor's office. Bandwul trades piles of papers with the receptionist without rising, and waves the lad into a chair.

"So," Bandwul begins. "I imagine you're looking for something to do." His tone is not unkind; he seems to have been expecting this.

Alec nods politely - shaking hands is something he does only on special occasions - and has a seat. "Well sir, it's more that I reckon something more ought to be done along the lines of what I'm already doin', which is watching over my sister."

Bandwul frowns. "I think you mean something more than guarding her person here on campus. She is quite safe here, you know."

Alec nods slowly. "Y'see, we'd treat a single horse thief a lot different than an organized lot of 'em back at the fort, sir. Now a single thief, maybe he's just down on his luck, or feelin' malicious, but he's no harm and he's easily caught. But if you got a whole circle of 'em, an organized operation as it were, now that means that any number of unexpected and unpleasant things could befall you if you don't do somethin' about it. And as I see it, if what happened to Cass isn't an isolated incident, I'd have to say, sir, an organized assault is what you're facin'."

Bandwul nods. "Yes. A direct, military approach." He sighs. "I think I understand what you're saying, and why, but... the University isn't like the Army, or even a hospital. We study things. We try to teach students how to think. We have about as much influence in Parliament as a single Lord, but no actual vote, and no police or military mission."

Alec nods slowly, watching Bandwul's face intently. "Alright," he says at last. "But then these men won't know what to look for, or how to proceed, unless you and yours instruct them. So I reckon I need to go back to Gerald and Wulfgang. One's got some line on some sort of new metaphoric, and the other's got a well-off old man. And if the Army'll listen and see what we've talked about, I'll come back here for whatever men you feel you ought to send. Thank you for your time, sir."

Bandwul holds up a hand. "Wait," he says evenly. "Don't leave yet."

Bandwul removes a pipe from a drawer in his desk, begins filling it. "You're not the usual sort we get here. You know about action. Most of us, including me, are in academics precisely because we're poor at action. The 'threat' that your sister ran into, up on the plateau, that's something new to everyone. And you're right, the City is going to need us to understand the Red beings."

Bandwul lights the pipe and takes a long pull before continuing. "I honestly don't know how much danger we're in - if any. But those fellows down in Parliament, they're pretty poor at action as well. They know how to do the things they've always done. Cargo missions. Treaties. Once in a while, send some gunships to roust out some pirates. Something entirely new..." he grins around his pipe. "That's just as beyond them, as chasing horse-thieves is to me."

"So you've actually got the right idea," Bandwul continues. "Or so I think. But if you charge in like you're raising the alarum at the Fort, nobody is going to be prepared to believe it." He slides a notebook across the desk - it's his Herald research, from last night. "Start with this. Tread carefully. Make us understand. If it's a real threat, then I'll lend my name on your plan of campaign."

Alec nods. "I reckon you're gonna make an academic outta me after all with this, eh?" he asks wrly, but he accepts the notebook anyway. "Well if that's how it'll be, sir, I will do my utmost to make you proud of me."

"For some students, the best path of study does not lead to a classroom." He pulls another folder out of his inbox. "And now if you'll forgive me, I have to get back to this."
