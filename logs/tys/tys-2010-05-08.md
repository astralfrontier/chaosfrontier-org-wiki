# University of Tys 2010-05-08

A laboratory has been turned over to Gerald for his 'etheric studies.' Gerald can quickly see why it's fallen into disuse. It's on the uppermost floor of the Steam and Mechanics building, occupying its northwest corner. There were once glass windows on two sides, but the chimneys for the steam boilers in the basement occluded the view. Wooden shutters remain in their places, some of which have been colonized by pigeons.

A lot of surplus equipment and pieces of equipment seems to have wound up here, so to its credit, the place is well-stocked for physical experiments. There's even steam and gas lines plumbed into a large, marble-topped workbench. Though the marble is dusty, scarred, and discolored, it does appear that the place was used for serious work in recent memory.

Gerald regards the mess with his hands on his hips. "Well. Not exactly the crystal city, but I bet we can do something with it," he says, as he walks along the benches cataloguing the equipment. "I bet the heroes in the penny dreadfuls don't have to dust..." he mutters.

Gerald spends several hours tidying up the old lab. By the time he's done, he's got a working workbench and has dealt with the worst of the dust and birds' nests. With the shutters open, the sun setting, and a gentle breeze blowing, it's a nice enough place... but all the gear emphasizes the enormity of the task. There's no prescibed experiment, no standard procedure, no 'etheric spectrograph'. The cloister bell rings, signalling the end of classes for the day, and the building grows quieter as everyone leaves. Gerald is suddenly, acutely aware silence and frustration...

... and one other sound. Like a whisper, coming from the workbench.

The sound comes and goes. Gerald swears that a piece of gear on the bench was... singing? no. But making some kind of sound. Several times he thinks he's seen movement from the corner of his eye, but there's nobody else up here, and no loose paper to blow in the breeze. Soon the youth settles into a crouch, staring across the top of the bench with an intense concentration...

Some tiny piece of a balance scale, a sliver of quartz scarcely larger than a grain of wheat, is... glowing. It lasts only for the width of an eyeblink... and then Gerald is aware of the dinner bell. He's gotten into one of his moods, he's lost track of time, and he's left with a monstrous headache. But the youth now knows of a place in his mind where such things can be seen.

"Ugh," says Gerald, rubbing his forehead. "Right. First thing tomorrow, find out what's special about that bit." Still, as he locks up the lab behind him, he's whistling a happy tune. The insight feels different without the city's spirit to guide him, but now he knows he has the tools he needs to proceed.

The following morning, Wulfgang finds that a message has been left in his dormitory pigeonhole. The stationary looks pretty upscale, the return address is in the better part of town, and the addressee is 'Stentz of the Steam Expedition'. Within the envelope is a single folded sheet - an invitation to Wulfgang ("And Your Stalwart Companions") to the Late Spring Lawn Party at the Estate of Lord Aldous Fowler.

Wulfgang looks at the invitation. He's, of coruse, seen them a few times. But it's one of the first that's ever been adressed specifically to him. He smiles, and bolts out of his room, finding Gerald, and flapping the invitation around, "I hope you have a suit ready!" Wulfgang is excited.

Gerald rubs his eyes; he looks like he hasn't shaved yet, and something about his stance says that the mug of coffee in his hand is the only reason he's upright. "Suit? Wheremi gonna get a suit?" he mumbles blearily.

Wulfgang gives Gerald a practically neolithic look, "Everyone has at least one suit." He pauses, "If you need one, we can go pick one up. I imagine Alec would have left his back home." Wulfgang notes Gerald's lack of excitement, and runs off to find Alec. "You gotta go too! And your sister..." Wulfgang pauses...

Alec can be found polishing and adjusting the sights of a long lever-action rifle he somehow wrangled out of the custody of the University. "Go where?" he asks calmly.

Wulfgang erks, and produces teh finely written invitation, "It's a party." He smiles, and looks Alec over. "Er..." He pauses, "Perhaps you should be the one to tell Cassandra..."

Alec peers at the invitation, turning it over a couple times for inspection. "What's this?" he asks at last.

Wulfgang smiles, "A party. A gathering. A get togther. A social function for the mixing and impressing of our peers." Wulfgang looks at Alec, "You had parties at the fort?"

The look on the young man's face changes instantly to recognition. "Ah yeah. So then, where are we gettin' whiskey from around here? I've been meanin' to ask anyway."

Wulfgang eyes Alec back, "I'm sure that aperitifs will be served." He is no longer smiling, "I'm sure we can get you some whisky. Though.." He stumbles across his words for a moment, "You need to be .. carefull.." He finishes, lamely.

Alec scratches his head. "Careful? If they're servin' bad liquor, just don't go, man." He shrugs. "I'll tell Cassie anyhow."

Cassandra emerges from the powder room, dressed for a day in the classrooms. The clothes issued by the University have a way of making everyone look boyish and somewhat dusty, but it's still an improvement over travelling gear. "I imagine that they do things somewhat differently in the City, brother. Do you remember when Father would go off to the Officer's Ball and leave Seargent Jens in charge? By the end of the week, Jens would stink of whiskey and everyone above Lieutenant of wine."

"Yeah but we can't afford that nice stuff, you know that," protests Alec.

Wulfgang open his mouth, then closes. His eyes move to Cassandra, and he tilts his head, "Howdy." Wulfgang straightens, "ANyway, becoming.. " he stresses, "too drunk, is frowned upon, yes." Wulfgang shrugs, "Money will not be required. Though your attendance will be recommended." He tilts his head again, and turns to depart. He pauses, "A uniform would be appropriate..."

Alec scratches his chin. "Don't have one of those. Reckon I'll need somethin' though, if I'm talkin' to such folk as we have in mind to talk to."

"For Alec and you boys, perhaps, but your livery doesn't suite me." Cassandra taps her chin. "Funny. I thought that perhaps in the city there would be machines to make clothes for you."

Wulfgang nods at Cassandra, "In fact, there are. After a fashion, anyway." He smiles, "I'm sure you wouldn't have a problem finding a dress." Wulfgang looks, "We could go looking, if you like."

Cassandra smiles. "Shall I be in your debt, then?" she says softly. "Well. Why not. And I suppose we're due something for that voyage to the Crystal City." She offers he elbow to Wulfgang. "Alec? Tell Wulfgang to behave himself. Then we shall be off."

"Wulfgang, behave yourself," Alec says dutifully.

Wulfgang takes Cassandra's enbow dutifully, and nods to Alec, "Of course. I am a gentleman." As he and Cassandra leave.

---

Wulfgang rapidly learns two things about Cassandra's shopping trip: this is her first time looking for clothes in the big city, and she wants to try on _everything_. A trip to the tailor might take Wulfgang an hour, or two at the most, if he's getting his shoes repaired as well. Despite leaving just after breakfast, it is well into the afternoon before Cassandra is satisfied with her ensemble.

The party is in three days; the resulting apparel will be delivered to the University tomorrow. Wulfgang swears that he's worn new holes in the soles of his boots from walking around the garment district. But the result, perhaps, will be worth the trouble.

It's easy enough to secure University ceremonial garb for Gerald and Alec, and the Stentz coach for the Saturday trip to the Estate. Nobody thinks to mention the invitation to Fredric until he shows up at the dormitory on Friday afternoon. He finds Wulfgang and Alec in the concierge's apartment. "Um... I suppose it is your invitation, Mister Stentz," he begins mildly. "And it's hardly an academic requirement. But if you think my presence will serve your purpose, I _was_ there." The professor smirks, more bemused than beset.

Wulfgang looks directly at Fredric. "I has just assumed everyone got an invitation. Professor. I assumed we would see you there." He resumes helping Alec into his vestments.

Fredric sighs, and plops down onto a sofa without invitation, far less formal than he usually is. "I have to wonder why. I'd not heard of any 'Lord Fowler' before. His family's run a vineyard out west for nearly eighty years, but he just won a Council seat during the last Auction. I think his interest in the 'steam expedition' is hardly academic. Thus the blow to my ego is mild."

"So what's he want then?" asks Alec.

Wulfgang nods at Alec's question, "In any case, Professor, I would be honored if you came with us." Wulfgang adds, just to resolve the question.

Fredric stands and bows formally, though his tone is light. "Thank you. For purposes of that investigation, I am at your disposal." He departs.

The coach arrives at the University on Saturday morning. Choi is at the reigns, and gets underway with his usual lack of ceremony or speeches.

Fredric joins Choi at the reins, so that Alec, Cassandra, Gerald, and Wulfgang can have the interior to themselves. The coach winds westward along the busy road outside the City's north wall. Numerous small estates, villages, and factories line the road the right, while the wall itself rises some twenty feet high on the left. The wall ends at the river that borders the city on the west side, and the road continues across a wide arc of a stone bridge. The river rushes noisily below, winding its way to the docks to the south: the same docks where the Steam Expedition saw its departure and return.

The road continues west along the coast, through lightly forested hills and two fishing villages. Some fifteen miles from the City wall, Choi turns northwards onto a narrow lane. Nearby is a large granite boulder engraved with the Fowler family crest. Other coaches are visible ahead and behind. The surrounding hills are covered by rows of grapevines and fruit trees; most are topped with windmills, turning lazily in the midday breeze.

Wulfgang looks at the line of coaches, "Well, at least we know there will be a few other people around. " He beams.

At his short time at the University, Alec's been busy. He put his skill at leatherworking to good use, taking a traveler's knapsack and refitting it with pockets and straps. Now it serves as a portable armory, storing a rifle and its ammunition, and two pistols. All he need do is unsnap it and the thing comes open, exposing any of the arms inside for instant use.

Now he makes sure that this pack is stowed safely, securely, and invisibly in the coach - as invisibly as he can muster, but still close enough to grab.

As it happens, there seem to be quite a lot of other people around - six other coaches, carriages, and assorted horsedrawn vehicles seem to have arrived prior to Expedition's, and a few more are rattling up the lane behind. Everyone is parked in a broad, fallow field at the end of the lane. The manor house is a big, old rambling affair. Old as it is, everything seems to have been patched and polished of late.

A footman approaches and greets Fredric. The professor directs him to Wulfgang, with the somewhat glib comment, "Our honorable leader rides within." The footman is a little taken aback by Wulfgang's youth, but accepts the invitation as genuine.

Everyone is given a chance to freshen up. The guest baths are surprising well appointed: hot and cold taps and flush toilets, all with the appearance of recent fitting over older plumbing. The lamps, though unlit, also appear new. The more traditional oil-burning type have been replaced with gaslights: unusual, this far from the city.

Gerald notes a slight irregularity in one of the gaslights and spends a few moments tuning the gas release valve. He's quite confident that the lamp will now light as brightly as the others, and almost completely positive it won't singe the lamplighter's eyebrows off.

Everyone eventually makes their way to the broad lawn behind the manor, where the guests are gathering. Fowler seems to have invited a cross-section of the city's social strata. Though poverty is not in evidence, there are some people who might be 'mere' tradesman, a few Lords, and everything in between.

Cassandra arrives a few moments later. The hard work of Wulfgang and the city's tailors have paid off: her dress is made of a blue, slightly shimmery material, a combination of natural fabrics and a new artifical silk made from coal. Someone decided that finery is not always frippery; the cut of the thing is more reminiscent of riding clothes than ballroom gowns... and she obviously knows how to wear it. Several heads turn as she makes her entrance; if she notices, the young lady doesn't show it.

Wulfgang smiles, and nods. Of course, Wulfgang has seen Cassandra in it before, but in the proper setting it's still nice.

Gerald is certainly distracted enough, though unlike some of the other partygoers he's all too aware that this young woman comes with a chaperone. And he rather likes Alex - he's a decent fellow, and Gerald doesn't want to annoy him.

There are perhaps forty guests and hosts in attendance. Those who toil in the vineyard seem to have the day off, and are absent from both the party and the surrounding fields. Quite a few household staff move hither and thither, managing serving trays and drinks. There doesn't seem to be a formal start to the party, and the protocol where guests are introduced seems to have been skipped. The arrival (and subsequent opening) of the estate's winebottles seem to be the proxy for the formal start, and the guests begin to circulate.
