With Gerald talking to Sonja alone, Alec pulls Wulfgang aside for a moment with a serious look on his face. "We need to have us a man-to-man talk here," he explains quietly.

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "I can respond?"

> (OOC) Alec says, "of course?"

Wulfgang looks at Alec, "Probably we do. I'll tell you, though, I have no intention of ever hurting your sister ever." He looks pretty serious about this. "And nothing's happened yet."

"That ain't my concern," sniffs Alec. "If anything _had_ happened, we wouldn't be _talkin_ right now, if you take my meaning. Naw, it's not that. See, your dad did offend my sister, an' that normally would mean that I'd be steppin' into her place to defend her. But I don't reckon that I can kill the pa of a friend of mine, an' that's what I'd be forced to do. So I'm thinkin' there's another way to resolve this. But what I got to know is - are you goin' to be serious about her?"

Wulfgang looks at Alec, then looks down, then kinda pushes his toe into the ground, "I'm as serious as I can be right now? I can assure you I am not simply playing around, if that's your concern."

"Yeah, that is my concern." Alec scowls a bit. "I ain't lettin anyone drag my sister along again. Not the Herald, nor your father, nor you, nor anyone. An' if this idea of mine works out, then it'll let me see her safely through what happened to her."

Wulfgang looks at Alec, "I would not put up with this if I didn't want it too, ya know?"

Alec brightens a bit. "Well alright then. In that case, I reckon I'll need your help findin' the right things to say. Here's the idea..."

> (OOC) Alec says, "assume that Wulfgang is briefed on the idea"

---

> (OOC) Wulfgang nods.

> (OOC) Alec says, "aaand at this point we slack around until GM shows"

> (OOC) TysGM has connected.

> (OOC) Alec says, "log is running GM"

> (OOC) Alec says, "please delete those"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "I assume there is something in backscroll for me to read."

> (OOC) Alec says, "yes"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "You know, you wouldn't HAVE to kill Stentz. o\_o Duels need not be lethal."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "In fact, they're supposed to NOT be."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Anyway. You want to act on the idea you described to me? And Wulfgang, you're OK with this?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "At what point do you loop in Stentz Sr?"

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "I think it's the now."

> (OOC) Alec says, "yeah, now is fine"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Something happens before that."

Alec and Wulfgang have finished their conference, but before they can find the elder Stentz (or anyone else, for that matter) Wulfgang's mother finds them. She's scowling, but trying to hide it. She nods politely to Alec and gives Wulfgang a strained smile.

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Oh geez mom i'm wearing fresh underware geez"

Wulfgang smiles at Mom, and looks back at Alec, then back at mom, "Hey Mom. What's up?" He smiles a bastard of a smile.

> (OOC) Wulfgang is need idle a bit for babby

"Wulfgang," she begins. "Your father is up to something, and he has not deigned to tell me what that might be... which means that he knows I will disapprove. But I know that you're involved, and so is that young lady... Cassandra. If you tell me what you are scheming, I promise not to get angry... with you, anyway." Her smile seems a bit brittle. "I do not participate in Alonzo's schemes. And I usually thank him to leave me out of them. But where you are concerned, my boy, he should know better."

Wulfgang smiles at Ms. Stentz. "Actually, My friend Alec here had an idea. But in general, the gist of it is to 'Not take well enough lying down.' As I learned from you." He smiles again, his smile a bit softer. "I do wish he'd have told you however, it would be nice to know myself."

"Oh, dear," she replies. "Flattery and evasion at the same time. You are so much his son."

Wulfgang shakes his head, "Oh, I wasn't evading, it's just that Alec explains his idea so much better than I. However, it goes something like..." And the idea is related, unless interrupted.

The plan is related. The three end up at a small table, sharing a pot of tea that was probably 'iced' when the party started, but which is now merely tepid. Mrs. Stentz appears angry and alarmed when she hears about the arranged marriage; but is somewhat more amused to learn that Sonja willingly placed herself in Gerald's care.

She gets serious at the same time the plan gets serious. The first point is simple enough; an expansion to the Army to police the railways. The second is more ambitious, and Mrs. Stentz looks a bit skeptical: extending colonial authority by rail. She interrupts before the boys get to the third point. "So you're suggesting... a 'Rail Fleet'? And setting up Cassandra as, what, 'Rail Duchess'?" She shakes her head and sighs. "Oh, your father will love it. But... son..."

Wulfgang blinks, "Yes?" He asks, truley unaware of what could be seriously wrong here.

"You don't _have_ to do any of that," she replies softly. "Oh, you are so his son. You're only seventeen and already planning to conquer the world!" She holds up her hand, palm out. "Wait, let me explain."

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Not the world, just one girl"

> (OOC) Alec has somethin here too, but waits on mom

"If you'd come to me with this a year ago, I would have just thought you were dreaming, as all boys dream, of wealth and adventure and... women." She pauses, seemingly embarrassed. "And it is like that, sometimes, at least for a while. But things are changing now... I mean, things _do_ change at your age, but this is more than that. It's like something came back with you, from that expedition." Here she pauses, and takes a long, unladylike drink from her tea glass.

Alec speaks up, having remained politely silent for long enough. "Ma'am, with respect, this ain't about your boy, nor about my sister. It's about them too, but it's also for those afflicted by these bouts of possession. My sister was one of the first. But she wasn't the last. People need protectin' as they spread out into these new lands, as they're bound to do. I propose to do the protectin', for all their sakes."

"But, young Master Teague, that is the _problem_!" She chokes on her drink for a moment, then sets it down. "Anyone else in town, I would say, go ahead, enlist in a Fleet, go out and get into some trouble. That's how our best and brightest lads and lasses get their start in life. Most of them come back. But now you're... 'Steam Heroes'. You bite off more, and you can chew more, but you can choke just like the rest of us." She sighs. "Please. All I'm saying, Wulfgang, is... you don't owe anything to him, or to me, or to those dratted Lords. You can choose your own bride, and you don't have become the 'Rail Duke and Duchess' by way of apology!"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Do you think Superman's mom ever asked him when he was going to make an honest woman of that Lane hussy?"

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Yes? They did live on a farm, I know how those people are."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Anyway, she should consider herself lucky. You might have brought home a girl from one of the Beast Tribes of the South."

Wulfgang smiles, "Perhaps this is just my way of making my choice. And as I was stumblign over with Alec just a bit earlier, I want an opportunity to see if Cassandra is my bride. I certainly don't want one right now." Wulfgang shrugs, "This seems like the best way to get everyone what they want. Which is all we're really trying to do."

"I see," Mrs. Stentz replies, seeming to regain some of her composure. "So there's no... urgency to this relationship?" This question seems as much directed at Alec as Wulfgang.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "In other words: 'Oh, thank God, she's not pregnant.'"

"Wulfgang has been and will be a perfect gentleman," Alec replies calmly. 'Or else' is in his voice; he need not actually say it.

> (OOC) Gerald says, "...I was gonna say, "Ah, those pregnant pauses.""

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "@emit "Not yet." Wulfgang quips."

> (OOC) Alec says, "Wulfgang will have two kinds of kids: legitimate offspring or bastard orphans"

"Alright then," she says, rising from her seat. "I'm going to go talk about the tea market with some of the other ladies, so you can try to have it your way with Fowler and your father. I can give him _his_ earful later."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Kitty is helping me gm. Slowing down the game some."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Want to get on with it?"

> (OOC) Alec says, "yah. let's get Gerald back for this too"

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Seems best."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK. Gerald, you ready?"

---

> (OOC) TysGM says, "I'm going to pose some stuff. If any of it is at odds with your intentions, tell me and we'll amend it."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "But First: I would like a roll from each of you. Hold on while I check your sheets."

> (OOC) Gerald is good to go.

> (OOC) Wulfgang rolls 3d6 for 5 (1 2 2)

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Wulfgang, a Politics roll... oh."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK, we'll take that."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Gerald, you're somewhat lacking in social skills. So we'll take a straight IQ roll from you, on the assumption that either Wulfgang or Alec will play spin doctor (eg kick you in the shin) if you go off message."

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Oh, sorry, I thought you were going to compare the roll to something sekrit on my sheet."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Alec, make it a straight roll on Soldier. This is less a case of having to put up with privation and risk and more a case of having to convince a bunch of priveleged wanks that you know something about how the army works."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Which for you probably IS privation and risk."

> (OOC) Alec rolls 3d for 7 (3 1 3) vs. 12, succeeding by 5

> (OOC) Gerald says, "IQ roll."

> (OOC) Gerald rolls 3d6 for 11 (6 2 3) vs. 12, succeeding by 1

> (OOC) TysGM says, "So let's see those for Gerald and Alec. The purpose of this is how well you 'sell' the plan to the collected guests and whether it works as planting a seed in their heads."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "That'll do."

> (OOC) Alec says, "see what, IQ? or is that roll fine?"

Alec and Wulfgang retrieve Gerald from the observatory. His telescope 'repairs' finished about half an hour ago; he's barely begun to tell Sonja about the Steam Expedition. So Sonja, true to form, follows along with a sketch pad and keen interest.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "That roll is fine."

One could begin this sort of thing with a grand announcement; a proclamation from the Steam Heroes, a public declaration of affections (possibly more than one), a plea for funds and loyalty. But it doesn't happen that way.

It's afternoon tea at a lawn party. The way things are done here, is to make sure that everyone either thinks they've had the bright idea themselves, or that everyone else is already in on the plot.

With Wulfgang leading the way, it turns out that it's not all that hard. He starts with his father and Fowler. Finding the two together is an advantage; it means that the elder Stentz will be less eager to discuss the arranged marriage, because then he'd have to bring up the embarrassing incident on the train with Cassandra.

Better than that, is to let Alec lead - not with a challenge over his sister's honor, but a discussion of colonial politics. The problems with extending the rule of law to the frontier. The Army's issues with banditry. The success of the 'steam packet' project: the new courier service piggybacking on the steam boats leased to Fauntgard's guild.

It naturally leads to the discussion between Fauntgard and Wulfgang, about colonization by river and rail. Gerald supplies the facts and figures; the young man's skill is matched only by his lack of guile. Everyone believes him because he seems to lack all competence at deception.

When the party started, less than one person in ten had given a serious thought to colonization or expansion of the city. But now... everyone's speaking like they knew it all along. More than a few are speaking like it was their idea.

And the Steam Heroes? The brave lads and their wondrous inventions? Such useful tools, all. Everyone knows that their job is to go first.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Phew. OK with everyone?"

> (OOC) Alec says, "sure? I had actually written the text earlier to be used, but this is fine"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Two options at this point. Open pose; or, a few NPCs will want to speak to you."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Sorry if I stepped on yhou. Didn't know."

> (OOC) Wulfgang has nothing to really say at this point.

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Excellent so far. :) Now: here in public, with all these people around, is either exactly the right time or exactly the wrong time to discuss rearranged marriages, but Gerald isn't going to be the one to bring it up. :)"

> (OOC) TysGM hmm

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Wulfgang will NOT be adressing the issue around so many people. If he does so Alec should hurt him."

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "It does not do to discuss a ladies disposition in public. c.c"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Tht's a statement that sounds like it's preceded by a shotgun being primed."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Anyway..."

---

There's an obvious lull as the afternoon tea ends; most people will be heading back to their guestrooms. The Steam Heroes remain; as does Isiah Fields.

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "THis is the reporter?"

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Yes."

The journalist and teller-of-tall-tales stands quietly nearby, watching the Great and Good retreat. "I see what you're doing here," he says quietly. "And I imagine you've done it before. How does one so young play a crowd like a harp?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "That question invites a response."

Wulfgang shrugs, "Find the right strings, I guess. You should really ask the composer of the piece, Alec." Wulfgang doesn't seem terribly impressed by his own performance tonight.

Fields looks like he's trying to think of something else to say, when Sonja interrupts. "I remember you. Fields. From the University's 91st Class. We graduated four years ago. Are you with these men as well?"

Fields is surprised. "Yes, I'm Isiah Fields, miss... but um... that is to say, the Steam Heroes invited me along for the weekend, but I've not been to the field with them."

Sonja nods. "Yes. You studied literature. I was in astronomy. So..." Sonja turns to Gerald. "You've got a Chronicler already. Yes, that makes sense."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "If you guys don't have anything else, I'd like to wrap soon. I'm tired."

> (OOC) Alec got nothin

> (OOC) Wulfgang is fine

> (OOC) Gerald can't think of much.

"A chronicler?" Cassandra asks. She seems more cordial now; she's gotten Wulfgang to play 'arm candy' all afternoon, and she doesn't seem to think of Sonja as a rival. "That's one call for what you've written about us, Mister Fields. But what sense does it make that he should?"

"There's a pattern to these things," Sonja replies. "I found a book, on our way back from the West. I think that you'll want to read it."
