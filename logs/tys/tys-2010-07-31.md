# University of Tys 2010-07-31

Most of Lord Fowler's guests have departed. A few have decided to stay for the evening. There's old Uncle Fowler, who seems disinclined to give any other name; Master Gregor, a representative of the Teamster's guild; and Master Clevon, some sort of banker. With Lord and Lady Fowler, there are a total of ten seated at the dinner table.

Choi, as the hired help, was not invited. The big man took only a little offense, and made himself at home in the Servant's Quarters. He shrugs after explaining it to Fredric. "I can hear what I want as well from the scullers as from the wealthy." And with a few bottles of wine left over from the reception, he goes to ply his trade.

The Lord sits at the head of the table, with the Lady at his right and his Uncle at his left. Gregor and Clevon are next in line, followed by Fredric and Cassandra, and then the boys. Alec elects to sit quietly at the opposite end of the table.

There's a politics to dinner seating: closer to the head of the house, means that one is more likely to be listened to. At larger gatherings, the Lord's family would be dispersed to other tables as his surrogates. There's even a pub game based on it played with playing cards, dice, and boards of pegs. One does not have to be an expert in it, though, to infefr that Gregor and Clevon expect to be taken seriously, over the academics.

Still, Fowler seems interested in everybody. There's some talk, over appetizers, of a business venture in the works. The banker is supposed to fund it; Fowler is supposed to run it; it's unclear what the teamster contributes.

Wulfgang chats in with the rest, perhaps more than the others, he missed this sort of interplay. Of course, he has nothing concrete to contribute, but the banter pleases him, even so.

Gerald is less talkative at this point, which is to say, nearly silent except for routine requests to pass condiments along the table. He seems to be focused on following the etiquette rules he was taught, as if he were a clockwork manners machine, and has little more than half an ear for a conversation that seems to have little to do with science or technology.

The main course is soon served - a modest-sized roast turkey, with piles of root vegetables. Not particularly fancy, but the guildsmen don't seem to care. Clevon asks a question during the lull while the butler is carving the turkey. "Professor Fredric... we have heard much of your adventures in the hinterlands, and many persons have seen your steam-craft. But I wonder, your boatman Rodrigo. He's claiming that the thing grew wheels and rolled on its own! And yet you came here in a carriage, like the rest of us. Whatever became of the prototype?"

Wulfgang smiles over, his face trying to give the impression of one on too much wine, even though he's not.. quite yet. "Oh that thing? We left it around. Of course, I'm sure the story becomes more magnificent in the retelling..."

Gerald seems to wake up. Now that the conversation has turned to something that interests him, the thin veneer of social rules blows away like a wispy rag. "Machines don't just _grow_ wheels," he says. "I-" he glances at Wulfgang, "_we_ put them there. It's just a straightforward application of using the steam engine's motive force on cartwheels rather than paddlewheels."

Fredric chuckles. "Simple _for you_, Mister Linkletter. But say on. I think that this is why we were invited?" Fowler looks like he's hiding a grin; Gregor, a scowl. But Clevon seems quite interested.

"So it can work on water, and on land?" Clevon asks. "Using steam for power instead of draft animals? How far did you go, on a cheap ton of coal?"

"Oh," says Gerald. "I didn't really work out how efficient we were on fuel. I thought it was just an accomplishment to get the same engine to work for both. You see, the rotational speed for water mode has to be radically different than for land travel..."

Wulfgang looks at Gerald, "Oh, we want a ways. We're still workin gon the concept, however. Such a maching takes constant tending in order to ensure something.... big doesn't happen."

Clevon smiles. "There, you see, Gregor? It takes tending. Fowler and his Univeristy allies haven't replaced the strong backs yet. And hadn't you said just today that you prefer coal-dust to mule offal?"

Wulfgang perks up, "Really? I can't imagine..."

Gerald blinks at Clevon. "Strong backs? Oh, you mean loading the coal. Yeah, I guess you'd get tired pretty quick if you weren't used to it. What _Wulfgang_ meant was that it takes an engineer, like Wulfgang or myself, to make sure the thing keeps working. I wasn't really trying to make it all that reliable, since we were right there to fix anything that went wrong."

Clevon frowns, and it's Gregor's turn to grin. "Umm..." the banker continues, rather dimly. "Not reliable... but you outran monsters and travelled the lost city in it? I mean, it is reproducible, yes? The Council won't grant the Stentz patent unless it's repeatable."

Wulfgang glares at Gerald, "Of course, mking something that would require lots of time and investment... Many hours to work the bugs out." He loks at Gerald, "Isn't that right, Gerald?"

"Oh, it's repeatable," Gerald says, beaming. "We just need to do more development first. Get a few redundant mechanisms, put together a standardized part list. I ended up casting a lot of the gears by hand - we'd have to make molds for those."

Wulfgang soghs deeply.

Gerald goes on, oblivious to Wulfgang's sigh. "Of course, I think we might do better than cart wheels. It's all I had to hand, but if we use a different size wheel, I can probably save a few gears in the water-to-land transition, that's one less thing to go wrong..." He's started to gaze off into space, lost in the intricacies of his craft.

Gregor gives an amused snort. "So, they've barely built the thing anyway. Well. For the Guild's interest, Stents may have his patent, and you, My Lord," he inclines his head, "may have your experiment. And if it ever comes to port, my brothers in the Guild shall be there for the carrying on and off." He excuses himself from the table. "Please excuse me. I wish you the very best of luck, but it seems my involvement in these discussions is a bit... premature."

Wulfgang looks at Gregor, "Premature? What exactly do you mean by that? I believe the time for investment is now. Our town could be on teh edge of this. We just can't have anythign for you tomorrow"

"All the better, Master Stentz!" he chortles, a deep vibration coming from his bearish frame. "Clevon! They're all yours! Spend your bank's gold as you will!" He doesn't precisely caper as he leaves, but the bow he takes from the door seems a bit theatrical, especially on such a large man. "It's a free country, after all!"

Wulfgang yells after Gregor, "They'll still need someone to drive them, of course." He shakes his head. "Lack of vision."

"No," Cassandra mutters. "Just a blowhard." She demurely picks up her fork and knife and tries continues eating, but has trouble supressing laughter at her own joke. As it happens, the laughter is contagious, spreading to the Fowlers, Clevon, and even Fredric.

Gerald even joins in the laughter, as much out of social pressure as anything else. "But y'know, steering a steam cart is a lot different from handling an animal team. Animals have a mind of their own, and steam engines don't." He looks off into the distance, in the direction he guesses the lost city to be. "Well, some steam engines," he adds, sighing.

"We might get to that some day, Mister Linkletter," Uncle Fowler says. "I think you see the shape of things by now. We wish to connect the outlying farms to the cities with steam-wagons. Perhaps on rails, as they do in the mines. So we'll settle for a non-spiritual machines to take us from here -" he points at the floor - " to there," he points eastwards, to the city.

"Oh! Rails!" Gerald says, his enthusiasm kindling again. "Yes, that solves a _lot_ of problems. I thought we were gonna be working on more amphibious carts, but if all you want to do is go between places on _land_, that's easy."

"Though the carts would still be useful for if you had a farm further out than the rails went, of course," Gerald adds. "Laying rails is gonna take a _lot_ of metal. And if they're out of shape, sproing, off the cart goes."

Clevon smiles widely, almost greedily. "A small matter of engineering, then," he replies. "Yes, my Lord Fowler, I believe we can do business."

The end of the day's entertainment is a visit to Fowler's 'observatory' - a converted outbuilding with a respectable telescope on top. Like the rest of the Fowler estate, it's a mixture of old buildings and new fittins: the gleaming brass and glass instrument, bolted to old twelve-inch timbers blackened with age. The telescope is about eight feet long, and has perhaps an eight-inch primary mirror. Fowler's placed a big overstuffed chair and sketchpad near the eyepiece. He even has an astronomical library, of sorts: a few sketchbooks with his own observations, and several textbooks recognizably printed on the University book-mill. There's also a few hand-written leather-bound volumes marked in the alphabets of the Eastern and Western empires.

Fredric attends out of academic curiosity, as does the Uncle. Lady Fowler and Master Clevon decline. Gregor is nowhere to be seen, apparently having given up on the enterprise.

Gerald understands telescopic optics in the theoretical sense, but not really the practical ones. Lord Fowler and Fredric are busy with the leather-bound books, and Uncle Fowler is doing his best to explain the telescope to Gerald. Gerald can't resist the urge to tinker, and easily finds the catches to open the barrel of the big instrument.

Within is the most perfect mirror he's ever seen, and an array of lenses, perfectly balanced and milled as smoothly as the finest pocketwatch. The youth rather loses awareness of his surroundings then...

Wulfgang smiles and pays a nod to the guests, "I think this will be a great advancement." He pauses just enough for effect, "For the city, of course. Farmer can get their supplies. I could see various towns cropping up around where the train stops, to trade supplies and messages..."

As Wulfgang converses with Lord Fowler and the other guests, Gerald's urge to tinker gets the better of him. A little pocket ruler comes out, measuring the focal lengths and optical diameters. Next comes the screwdriver...

After about an hour of such tinkering, Gerald beams at his 'handiwork'. There wasn't much spare material to work with, and he was fortunately reluctant to cannibalize the parts of the existing mechanism, but the focusing dials have been regeared into a bewildering variety of knobs, each moving the lenses at a different ratio. The eyepiece end of the telescope now bristles with a variety of metal protrusions, some of which are traditional dials, others are oddly shaped pieces of metal that move like keys. He goes over the operation, half to himself. "So, _this_ dial is for coarse adjustments, but if you pull _this_ lever, the dial can be used for the finest setting. This ratchet, _here_, can be used to adjust the pitch in small increments..."

Fowler finally catches up to what Gerald is doing. The aristocrat's jaw drops, followed by a croak halfway between wonder and terror. "Oh my gods! It's... but all the extra levers..." He looks through the eyepiece, and tries to operate the instrument. There's a few tense moments, and Fredric lays a hand gently on Gerald's shoulder. "That's all reversible, right?" he asks evenly.

Gerald blinks. "Well, yeah. This telescope is an exquisite piece of work, sir - it'd be sacrilege to damage any of the parts. I didn't even score calibration marks on the dials."

"It's... exquisite," Fowler finally says. "I can make out the Lunar Quadrangle with twice the sharpness of before..." He reaches for a sketchbook and flips to the last used page. "But I can't work out any of it!" he says in some shock, as he twists one of the many new knobs. "Gods, kid, are you part machine yourself?"

"We're sorry," Fredric says hurridley. "It's just what he does! We'll fix it!"

Gerald laughs. "I wonder sometimes. It's as if me and 36 got crossed or something. He's a machine that's all interested in spiritual stuff, and I'm a person who does gears and levers. No, sir, if you're trying to sharpen the focus you need to turn _this_ wheel..." he adds, trying to explain his handiwork.

Fowler slumps back in defeat in his big chair. "Geniuses," he murmurs, shaking his head. "But I'm not one. No. Unless I'm hiring you to run this thing for me, I can't work it at all, and where's the fun in that? No. Please... just... put it back." He levers himself up and heads for the manse. "You've honored me with your presence and we'll all profit together. But I need a drink."

Gerald sighs. "Oh, all right," he says, opening the mechanism again and sketching a few notes on the revised version. "Maybe I can reuse the principles for something else..."

"I'll stay up here and make sure the result is comprehensible," Fredric tells Uncle Fowler. "Would you please show my other charges to their rooms?" The Uncle obliges, leaving only Fredric and Gerald in the observatory. "Gerald..." Fredric begins. "Oh, never mind." He settles into Fowler's easy chair and picks up the Lord's sketchbooks. "I'm going to look at these. Tell me when you're done."

Gerald, satisfied that he's preserved the crucial details of his modifications, begins the process of dismantling - or perhaps re-mantling - the telescope. "Sorry, sir," Gerald says, not sounding particularly repentant. "I just can't leave things like this alone."

"I've noticed," Fredric replies. "You've learnt everything we have to teach about machines, and I daresay you know some things of sorcerous ken. But... mortal minds need to participate in our world as well. Fowler will prove to be a valuable ally, but you - we - nearly frightened him off. To say nothing of damaging his toy." He flips a page. "Actually, these aren't bad. He could easily teach a first year course in astronomy and possibly drafting. The point is: in the face of a new science, even the Lords are just commoners. And we can't exclude them."
