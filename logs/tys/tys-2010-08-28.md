# University of Tys 2010-08-28

---

The expedition returns to the University from Lord Fowler's estate the following day. The same fifty miles of unpaved, hard-packed coast road slowly spools. The vast blue expanse of the ocean is often visible to the south. On the north side of the road, trails and lanes lead into light woods or farm fields. Cart traffic is fairly heavy, along with the smells and noises of draft animals.

Along the way, Fredric often points to boulders, trees, and streams on the north side of the road. "When Fowler is building his railway, he'll need to move things like those," he explains. "Or go around them. I don't think this will be a simple matter of blazing a trail or laying stone upon stone."

Gerald looks out onto the vista. "Hmmm..." he says, and his pencil scrawls a few marks. "Yes, as I thought. The turns will have to be gentle, or it'll have to move slowly. Otherwise, it'll tip over. We could make a broader wheelbase, but that would put up the cost per mile of track."

Wulfgang looks at Gerald, "Surely there's some chemical that could move the rocks without a lot of.. mechanical or labor effort." He shrugs, "Maybe the teamsters will have something to do after all."

Gerald taps his pencil against his chin. "Chemicals don't _move_ rocks. You could make a gunpowder explosion, but-" **scribble scribble** "-no, it wouldn't have enough force. Hm..."

Fredric looks back at the roadside. "Yes, it will keep a lot of people busy, as long as he can afford to pay them. Nobody should be worried about this putting them out of work. And if it works here, then why not along the river as well? Or along the eastern road?" He settles back onto the bench. "This could be the start of something big."

The coach arrives back at the University gates without incident. Choi departs, taking it back to the Stentz residence. Fredric also says his goodbyes, with the admonition to be ready for class the following day.

Wulfgang has gotten a wild hare, as his mother always said, about this railroad thing. His time is pretty evenly split by doing the absolute minimum that he can during the school year, and given the mounds of 'extra credit' that Frederic gave for their little trip, is not a whole lot of effort. More and more, Wulfgang's time is spent with his father, being in on, and sometimes, arranging the various deals to get the railroad started. He hops in and out of various deals, in particular the inklings of another expedition out that way again, after the term ends of course.

Wulfgang's token efforts at scholarship are sufficient to keep a passing grade, but his real education comes from the railway venture. There's dozens of details to manage, starting with a surveys and engineering plans for the railbed. Then there's laborers and tools to clear the way, more laborers and tools to build the berms and banking where the rails will run, and of course crews to lay the rails themselves. The rails are made of steel, so there's orders for iron and coal, and negotiations with foundries. The very first engines will be little more than mechanized wagons, inspired by the 'rolling barge', and using the same model of engine.

The very first obstacle is obtaining right-of-way from the landholders to either side of the road. Fowler negotiates a vote in the City Council to obtain the necessary rights by 'eminent domain', in return for a municipal share of the new company. They stop short of providing funding, though; the success or failure is entirely on Fowler's shoulders.

The powerful and wealthy of the city are still generally skeptical of the railroad plan, but seem generally disinclined to get in the way. The notable exception are those overseeing the city's mines; anticipating the orders for coal and iron, they provide all the support Fowler needs.

Wulfgang takes several trips outside the city, many of them to those very mines. This proves to be an education in itself...

---

The City's iron mines are run by guild engineers and employ thousands of free laborers, who have cut miles of tunnels deep under the local hills to the northeast. The main galleries follow ancient veins of iron that seem to have been deposited thousands of years ago by a meteoric event. If anyone understands the importance of rails, it's these people; those same miles of tunnel are filled with narrow-gauge railways and furnicular trams.

The coal mines are a different story. The largest coal mine is an open-pit excavation into an ancient, metamorphosed peat bog. They've been digging here for four hundred years without hitting bedrock; the largest pit is a hundred feet deep and half a mile across. Labor here is still mostly man and beast, with a few steam-powered cranes. Horse-drawn carts take tons of coal out of here every day. Also, for many here, 'miner' is a sentence... the largest mine is also a penal colony, where the City sends its violent criminals and thieves.

The elder Stentz invites Gerald to visit both of these, and whichever of his classmates can spare time from their studies. On the coach ride out, he has something to say about the penal colony.

"They're criminals," the elder Stentz begins. "But we can't look down on them. In my younger days, on a voyage to the East, I got into some trouble... I ended up in a place like this. I had too much to drink in the wrong place and when I woke up I was in chains. They gave me a shovel, and enough to eat, and that was about it." He shudders. "I could have died there, if not for Choi." He's silent for several moments, then looks straight at Wulfgang with a piercing gaze. "Never write anyone off, boy. Not everyone in chains belongs there. And even ruffians and urchins should have a chance at a better life. Also, don't get drunk in places where you don't speak the language."

Wulfgang looks at his father in somwher a new light. He .. can't even find a word to say, which is rare for the younger Stentz boy. His mouth opens and closes a couple of times, then he looks at Gerald, and shurgs in that sheepish way of teenage boys embarassed by their father.

Mister Stentz shrugs, looks away, and gives the boys some respite. "Anyway, most of these men do belong here... at least for the moment. Iron and steel are in Guild hands, but the City runs the coal directly. The military handles the penal mines, and City bureaucrats handle the free labor." He grins. "No Guild issues with coal. Just cash-and-carry. This may well be the easiest part of the venture."

Visitors to the once-disused laboratory in the northwest end of the Mechanics building - where Gerald slinks off to every time his regular class schedule allows, and occasionally needs to be dragged out of for other classes - would hardly know what to make of the place.

The entire space is festooned floor-to-ceiling with half-done experiments - here something that looks like a miniature paddlewheel with its paddles painted in black and white on opposing sides, there a gas burner boiling steam into a series of tubes that looks like a drunken glassblower had the hiccups. Among the oddities is a man-sized pendulum with a series of wooden blocks in a circle around it; a few of the blocks are down, and they all have numbers painted on them. Next to the pendulum is a tattered blanket and pillow, which Gerald dragged in at some point.

Should a visitor happen to enter the laboratory when Gerald is in full swing, they would generally find it nigh impossible to gain his attention. Even Frederic was once greeted with "Oh hi. Can you pull on that rope over there while I close the blinds? Thanks" - all said without Gerald even looking up. And although Gerald doesn't seem to be working on developing anything combustible, something about the rickety nature of his experimental constructions warns against disturbing them to gain his attention.

Or then again, sometimes a visitor finds Gerald simply staring at one of his contraptions - not taking notes, or recording data, but just staring with a look of intense concentration. It would be a mistake to believe that Gerald is oblivious when in these trances, though. One time, Wulfgang came into the lab asking a question, only to find Gerald apparently captivated by a sealed box. Assuming Gerald wasn't listening, he went away. During dinner that evening, Gerald blurted out a sentence, apparently at random - which was the answer to Wulfgang's question.

The experiments may be the first systematic study of 'sorcery' - a field of endeavor that drives most of its pracitioners mad. For whatever reason, Gerald's exposure to it is gradual... almost controlled. He can often see facts about people as if it was written on their faces; sometimes, he can even see it of _things_. Old bits of rock and crystal - particularly those that resemble the crystal engines of the ancient ruins - have such fascinating stories to tell...

On the right days, Gerald feels like he can hear the earth whispering secrets to him. On the wrong days, though, he can't make it stop.

Gerald's longest 'experiment' begins at sunset one early summer evening. He attended his classes and sat for dinner - physically, anyway. But his mind has been here, in his lab and sanctum. Now the sun is sinking beneath the distant western mountains. Orange light floods in, along with the shouts and laughter from a distant soccer game and the early songs of evening birds.

Gerald continues an earlier experiment, with a shard of old quartz and a mirror array similar to the one that kept First of Six powered on the trip upriver. It causes the crystal to scintillate with such beautiful colors... colors that it seems only Gerald can see. The lad settles into a large padded chair and fixes his gaze on the apparatus once more.

We now know that man is not native to the World. He came across the gulf of space, from somewhere else. The World was a coincidence: the right star, the right year, the right gravity. But the rest was wrong. The World was shaped into the image of the old home by machines... patient machines with thoughts thousands of years long...

Minds like that do _something_ to the world around them, in ways that have nothing to do with chemistry or physics or coal or steam. And they live still; their great, slow thoughts are like the sound of a distant storm, to those who know how to listen...

Gerald awakens suddenly, cold and confused. He's in his laboratory, but the light is all wrong; several hours must have passed. He's also on his back, staring at the cieling. Then Fredric's face swims into view, and he also hears Bandwul's voice. "Hells, man, get a blanket over him! Get him over by the fire!"

There's a blur; then Gerald is sitting in a chair, by the small furnace in the corner of the lab. Someone drapes a wool blanket across his shoulders. Fredric is still there. "Gerald. Can you hear me? What day is it? How many fingers am I holding up?" The Professor is holding up three fingers in a kind of 'w'.

"Three," Gerald says promptly and sharply. Then his eyes defocus again. "Fredr'c? What do you mean. It's Tuesday, of course. Why? W-what happened?"

Bandwul puts a kettle on the furnace; Fredric seems to be checking Gerald's eyes and head for signs of trauma. "Nobody has seen you for a while. Gerald, it's Friday. Friday night. You've missed two exams. We came to see if you were alright."

Gerald sits up sharply. "What?" he exclaims. The sudden effort makes his head spin and he slumps back. "Well... that explains why I'm so hungry," he says. "Wait, wait... what exams?"

Fredric sits back on a clear patch of floor. "_Finals_, Gerald. But I think we can safely give you a medical excuse. I'm sure Chancellor Bandwul is relived that he won't have to explain your demise on our premises to your parents."

"Well, so am I," Gerald says, still sounding a little dazed. "Dying would put a serious crimp in my experimental schedule." He rubs his forehead. "And that would be a shame. The things I've seen... and heard..."

Bandwul's reply starts with a short, snort of a laugh. "Usually when this happens it's because the student is _on_ something. But all I see here are old machines." The chancellor picks his way carefully to the exit. "Fredric, take him to the doctor, make sure there's no side-effects. And you, lad," he points at Gerald. "You'll still be taking those exams, and you'll writing up where you went on your little trip. What you saw and heard. And I'll be reading it." Then he's gone down the stairs; a moment later, the sound of him crossing the yard comes in through the window.

A long moment passes. "So... where _did_ you go?" Fredric asks.

"Into the minds of the Great Machines," Gerald says. "Devices like what we saw in the Crystal City, which remade the World to suit us. They still live... somewhere out there."

Fredric nods slowly. "For you, somehow, that seems very apt." He gets up slowly, and helps Gerald to his feet. "Come on. Let's get to the infirmary. I think I need to hear more of this."
