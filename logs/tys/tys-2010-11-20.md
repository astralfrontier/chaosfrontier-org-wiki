> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "In theory it would run twice a month."

> (OOC) Alec says, "you scheduled to run every 2 weeks. if you run on average every month, you show up about 50% of the time ;)"

Moses Winston, foreman of the purportedly haunted mine of Longfellow's Hole, leads the Steam Heroes to the mine's entrance. It's early afternoon on a Sunday, so strike or not, the mine is closed. A motley assortment of miners are sitting around outside their barracks. Some are reading, some are playing boardgames, and more than a few are muttering desultorily. Most take notice of the foreman and the passing youths, but none seem inclined to speak up or interfere.

> (OOC) TysGM notes: http://pandoraslair.org/sites/default/files/UniversityMineMap1\_1\_Upper\_Galleries.jpg

The mine began as a natural cave, of sorts, but has been widened to a fifteen-foot apeture. The yard in front of the mineshaft is cluttered with minecars on narrow-guage rail, conical piles of mine tailings, and chunks of iron-bearing rock, crated for shipping. The tunnel appears to split a few dozen paces in; one branch heading east, the other north. A few oil lamps can be glimpsed glittering further on. Otherwise, it's pitch-dark.

> (OOC) Alec says, "you are likely to be eaten by a grue."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "If we find a particularly photophobic example of red life, you just gave it a name. o.o"

> (OOC) Alec says, "the miners offering us light sources, or will they provide if asked?"

Wulfgang looks at Alec, then at Gerald. "I suppose we didn't decide to bring a flashlight..."

Winston leads the party to a supply shed before moving on. He hands out miner's helmets to everyone. They're basic steel hats, suspended on a web of leather straps. A small carbide lamp is affixed to the front. He also holds up two types of lantern. "This is an ordinary oil lamp," he says, raising the one in his left hand. It's a typical model with a thick glass shell around the wick. "And this is a firedamp lamp," he says, raising the right one. In place of the glass shell is a fine metal mesh. "Whichever of you is going first, should have one of these. If it starts to turn blue, that means you're walking into mine gas. Back off, unless you want to be blown to the ancestors."

"Ancestors 'n me aren't on speakin' terms," mumbles Alec, taking a lamp.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "I'm assuming you all take the helmets. You can carry a lamp in one hand and a weapon in the other. Anyone \_not\_ taking a lamp?"

> (OOC) Alec says, "GM, SOP will be to crouch and put the lamp down if we see or hear anything unusual. I'll be packin'"

Wulfgang reaches out and grabs one of the firedamp lamp. He smiles back to his peers, "Most expendable, right?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK."

> (OOC) TysGM one sec

Winston's brows knit. "Here you, aren't you the Stentz heir?" He looks imploringly at Frederic. "They're buying all the iron for that big new steam-rail. You can't get him hurt down there!"

"Ain't nobody more expendable here," says Alec firmly, taking Wulfgang by the shoulder and gently easing past him. "How 'bout whoever's most cautious go in front."

"And we're supposed to believe that's you?" Wulfgang smirks, but lets Alec take the lead.

> (OOC) TysGM swaps previous two

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Got one more for you to swap."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Fire away, Gerald. We'll make it right after."

"Well, it sure as hell isn't _you_ Wulfgang," Gerald says, grinning. "Not me, either, I have to say. About as cautious as a puppy with a new toy, me. Thank you, Alex."

Wulfgang smirks at the mine foreman, "Don't worry. I'll be fine." He pats the foreman on the back, "Let's go find your ghosts..."

The foreman, looking less than mollified, leads the way into the tunnel. "Well. You _are_ the Steam Heroes, I suppose you know what you're doing..."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Any more banter?"

> (OOC) Wulfgang is good

The foreman leads the way along the north fork. He carries a firedamp lantern, though he explains that it's unlikely to be necessary, this close to the surface. He also carries a large can of lamp oil; every thirty feet or so, he stops and refills a wall lamp. Some effort has been made to make the floor of the tunnel regular, for the sake of mine cart tracks; the walls are somewhat less regular. Individual tunnels range from six to twenty feet in width. The first large 'room' along the tunnel is just over twenty feet wide and nearly fifty feet long. "This was Longfellow's original dig," the foreman explains. "Just him and his sons, a hundred years ago." He taps the floor with his boot. "Huge lumps of hematite, where an old underground stream came to the surface. When he got all the easy iron, he sold the place off. We've been digging the old streambed ever since."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "underground stream?"

He leads the way through two more similar galleries, then turns left through a large archway. Unlike the usual pine and oak pilings, the arch is made of stones, mortarred into place. "We once though this vein was played out," the foreman continues, as he leads the party down the sloping corridor. The walls are irregularly worked, averaging about fifteen feet. It chokes up at one point to just about five feet to get around a large face of granite. It's getting noticeably cooler; this is maybe forty feet lower than the entrance gallery, though quite a ways back into the hills.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Fixed."

The foreman leads the party through several more galleries. At last, he stops, spreads his arms, and pronounces with some ceremony, "This is the very tip of the Deep Vein."

The chamber is roughly shaped like a flattened ovoid. The rock here is noticeably different, even to an untrained eye. The walls, floor, and ceiling glitter in the lamplight, though it is not the glitter of precious metals. Glass? Mica? Quartz? Perhaps all three. At the rear of the chamber, the shaft continues downwards into darkness. There are no lit lanterns visible within, but it glimmers all the same - whatever is making the walls sparkle here, the shaft has been clearly dug to follow it.

Wulfgang looks at the foreman, "This is where they hear the Ghosts?" Pointing down the indicated shaft.

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Didn't we get mica up on the plateau?"

The foreman puts down his lantern, and nods at Wulfgang. "It takes some twists and turns. Another hundred and fifty feet or so laterally, and another fifty down. Then it breaks out into the Mid Galleries - the works we dug to get at the meteoric iron. Spend any time in there and you'll hear plenty. Men who work the day in there, can't sleep the night after." He shudders. "Myself included, once."

"I've been meaning to ask," says Gerald. "What sort of thing do the ghosts actually _say_?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "There was the huge mirror array and the crystal spire in the middle of the buried city. There was mica and shocked quartz present in the escarpment, in various layers, that seemed to have been laid down between 10,000-20,000 years ago."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Bah. I never did get around to picking up Geology. Been too busy studying magic this semester."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Knowledge spells are all well and good, but to do anything /useful/ with them it seems you need some decent knowledge /skills/ n.n"

> (OOC) TysGM needs a few moments to make a reply to Gerald's excellent good question

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Well, I'm kind of following in 36's footsteps here. Negotiate as a first resort - and to do that, you must actually listen to the other side's bargaining position."

The foreman sits and resettles his helmet, thinking over Gerald's question. "Mostly, it' s a lot of babble," he says, "or buzzing noises. When we think we can make out words, it usually sounds like a name. Usually our own name - but often someone else's, like another miner. That's when we're awake," he adds. "Nobody remembers words from their nightmares. Just a sense like something's coming for them. Something angry. People keep saying that they're dreaming of other places - rocky and foul-smelling, like the mine, but it's outdoors, with a bright red sky. I don't know if they're all the _same_ horrible place, or different places for everyone."

Gerald rubs his chin. "Sounds like your 'ghosts' are as bestial as the little critters that've been crawling out of the hole. In fact, they may _be_ the critters." For once, Gerald seems not to be saying everything that's on his mind - though he does share a glance with his fellow 'Steam Heroes', and particularly Cassandra, whose own dreams were once similarly plagued.

Cassandra nods back at Gerald. "I'm... not hearing anything myself. Yet."

Wulfgang nods, "We probably need to get.. closer. Unfortunately."

Winston stands up, picking up his lantern. "Well. S'pose I owe it to my crew, to lead you in there. I mean, apart from one critter and some bad smells, nobody's been hurt yet. So..." he pauses. "You think it needs exorcising? Or you think it needs hunting?"

"Main difference 'twixt those activities is the tools," Alec answers dryly.

"I suppose you're right," the foreman replies. He leads the way down into the Deep Vein.

---

The tunnel twist and turns. There's a pair of narrow-guage rails along the floor, and winch equipment here and there. It's hard to tell how far it's gone, though Winston assures everyone that it's as he said - fifty feet down, and maybe 150 feet laterally. The tunnel turns right - perhaps this is eastward - and widens into a small gallery. It's warm and stuffy, though better than it was in the shaft. Winston refills and relights the lanterns here, revealing a few mine carts stacked against one wall. A tunnel leads south to a small storage room; another goes north for a short ways before turning east again.

> (OOC) TysGM notes: http://pandoraslair.org/sites/default/files/UniversityMineMap1\_2\_Mid\_Galleries.jpg

> (OOC) Alec brb. assume that if combat breaks out, I shoot Wulfgang

> (OOC) Wulfgang dies helpfully.

Winston waves his lantern around. "We got down here, and found a lot of small tunnels, shafts, and fractures that seemed to link up quite a few natural caverns and cavities. There was a little bit of groundwater here, and a lot of gas. Took weeks to clear." He puts on a glove and reaches into a neglected mine cart. He carefully lifts out his hand, and opens it to reveal a rock... no, a large, transparent crystal, the size of his palm. "Damndest thing," he murmurs. "The place was full of bits of rock with high concentrations of particular metals. Lots of meteoric iron, silver, even some gold. And these... lots of quartz. A few of the chambers are big geodes with semi-gems stuck in the walls."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "You guys got that map open?"

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "I do."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "open"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK. So. Where to?"

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Abouts where are we now?"

> (OOC) Alec says, "player reminder to Gerald & Wulfgang: what was first of six found inside of?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "The arrow at the west edge of the map, just below the midline. The big round room in the northeast is where they broke through into a huge gas pocket that turned the air ammonious."

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Cassandra?"

> (OOC) Alec says, ""

> (OOC) TysGM says, "The geode room is in the southeast - the room with rough walls on the map."

Gerald leans close, examining the crystal. "Did you bring any of this to the surface?"

Winston nods, and hands the crystal to Gerald. "Real pretty, but it doesn't sell for much. Most of it went to jewelers in the City."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Magery picking up anything obvious yet? If not, I'll hang onto this for now."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Good thinking. Yes, this is that same stuff."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "It's sleeping. But you think that it's got a tale to tell."

"Hmm," says Gerald, running a hand over the crystal. "I'd like to have a look at one of the geode rooms."

---

Winston wordlessly leads the way. He stops in the small storeroom to the south to retrieve a can of lamp oil, then leads the way north. After maybe thirty paces the tunnel swings east, and Winston stops to light a lamp. It's a long, low gallery, running more than a hundred feet to the east into inky blackness. Other tunnels branch off to the north and south; Winston ignores these. The ninth lamp is on a wall, opposite the entrance to a cramped tunnel leading south. The southbound tunnel is only large enough to admit one person at a time, and badly hunched over.

Winston holds his firedamp lantern into the tunnel, but it burns with a clean yellow-white flame. "Looks okay," he says. "But it's cramped, and there's no other way in or out. So I don't suggest that we all go in there at once."

"I'll take post here," volunteers Alec.

"Then I'll go in with Gerald," Frederic says. "The rest of you should stay here."

> (OOC) TysGM hmms. Party split.

> (OOC) TysGM makes some notes.

Winston describes the passage to Frederic. Eighty feet south; then a twisting section that leads east for about fifty feet, before rapidly widening into a small chamber that intersects the geode. Frederic insists on going first, pushing the firedamp lantern before him.

It's slow, and tedious, muddy, and sometimes painful. The cramped tunnel is in parts only passable by crawling. The rock here seems vaguely sedimentary, but run through with sharp shards of quartz. Several minutes later, Frederic and Gerald emerge into the interior of the largest geode anyone has ever seen...

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Anyone have claustrophobia?"

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Gerald does not."

There's a decent size room here, a natural cavity of some kind. The wall to the north has crumbled, and the floor is covered by fragments of soft, calcinous rock and large, very regular gragments of quartz. Beyond the wall is the inside of a sphere, some twenty feet in diameter. The inside of the wall is completely lined with quartz crystals. They vary from finger-sizes to the thickness and length of a man's forearm. All are clear as glass and seem to be flawless. Even with light as dim as miner's helmets and lanterns, the slightest movement is enough to set off a dazzling storm of reflections and refractions.

Frederic can only stand agape. He's set his lantern down on the floor, but even the slight movement of the head that comes from breathing is enough to cause the whole room to scintillate. "By all that came before me," he breathes softly. "This image alone..."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Then you can act freely. It cost fatigue to go through that rat-hole, but we'll worry about that if you get into a fight."

Gerald's eyes glitter in the light reflected from all around. "Great gears..." he whispers. "What I wouldn't give to project sunlight into _this_ place. Though I think I'd need to wear a blindfold..."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Now: I wouldn't mind a little assistance on using knowledge magic effectively to analyze what, if anything, might be in here."

> (OOC) TysGM hmm

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Just a moment."

> (OOC) Alec has some spell suggestions as well if you drop by

> (OOC) Gerald says, "One moment, then."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "You can attempt any of the Knowledge spells by paying the fatigue cost. This may help you: http://www.io.com/~jwilson/gurps/data/gsp-xls.zip"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Since the thing is so damn big, it's going to be pretty easy to study. Under other circumstances it might count as a fucking el grande powerstone. But it's been buried, and is totally inert."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "It's more that I don't know what I'm looking for, have a limited fatigue pool, and am still working on what the various spells can actually /do/."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "At the risk of sounding like a dick, the four of you who are left in the main gallery - Winston, Cassandra, Wulfgang, and Alec - are going to have an encounter."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "While these other two are occupied with the big rock."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Well, divination will take an hour anyway."

> (OOC) Alec says, "encounter as in, we sit around and talk about our feelings"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "So we can easily leave both for next time."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "no... Encounter, as in..."

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "An encounter as in, Acel shoots Wulfgang."

---

Four people remain in the main gallery, watching the small tunnel down which Gerald and Fredric disappeared. Wulfgang, Alec, Cassandra, and Moses Winston are waiting, making the best furniture they can out of local terrain.

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Geomancy and crystal gazing /as described/ aren't technically eligible under the circumstances, but I've got to be able to do /something/ with crystal gazing inside a damn geode."

Everyone, save for Alec, catches the sound at the same time. A shuffling, rustling, and squeaking - hard to localize down here, but certainly originating somewhere between the party's present location, and the entrance to the Deep Vein. And it's getting louder...

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Let me check my notes, Gerald."

> (OOC) TysGM grumbles. Should have worked this out in advance. Just a moment.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "I don't have descriptions for Divination, or for Crystal Gazing. Sorry."

> (OOC) Alec says, "of the spell? or the specific outcome it'll have?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Specific outcome."

> (OOC) Alec says, "it's all good"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Looks like it's just another variety of Divination."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "SO here's another ad-hoc mechanic:"

> (OOC) Gerald says, "IN general, Divination answers a simple question in a way appropriate to the form of divination. Crystal-gazing is usually done with a special-carved crystal ball (First of Six would assuredly work if it wanted to), and the result is a vision relevant to the question."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "You've got the Wildcard Spell for Knowledge, so you can definitely attempt it. The base time for the spell is listed as 1 hr with a cost of 10, which means that it will knock you on your ass. This is consistent with a previous interactions Gerald has had with the crystals."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "That's pretty much what I have in mind. And... you mentioned getting here has a fatigue cost. I think Gerald's gonna spend another hour or so getting up the strength to return."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "My next XP buys are going to be upgrades to my fatigue pool."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "However. Your 'aetheric science' is far more developed now than it was. And this thing, though unpowered, is enormous. So if you successfully interface to it, you'll enter a trance for the duration, but we'll but the fatigue cost in half."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "We'll put you down 1 for crawling here, and down 5 more for the divination. Leaving you with 4 fatigue, so you're ambulatory."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "That's fine."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Meanwhile, there's a fight brewing outside. And I think we'd best address both issues next week."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "All right."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "...next session, you mean? I know Futile Octave isn't running next week, but..."

> (OOC) Wulfgang like, 100%% won't be here.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "In two weeks, you mean, Wulfgang?"

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "No, next week. Sorry."

> (OOC) Alec says, "next week would have been FO, and I bumped that"

> (OOC) Gerald says, "OK, let's make sure we have this straight. Next week is no game. Week after that is FUTILE OCTAVE. Is this viable for all involved?"

> (OOC) TysGM y

> (OOC) Gerald says, "...crap, I'm confused. Week after next is Tys, right?"

> (OOC) Alec says, "this is what we have the calendar for ;)"

> (OOC) Alec says, "today's 11/20. next week is 11/27 = holiday"

> (OOC) Alec says, "12/4 is open for Tys. 12/11 is FO. 12/18 = open. 12/25 = holiday"

> (OOC) Alec says, "ask any questions which survived this explanation."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Yes, let's do that. We can get DeGroot killed off for my 37th birthday."
