# University of Tys 2010-12-04

> (OOC) Log "Tys-2010-12-04" started by TysGM at Sat Dec 4 19:07:28 2010 CST (OOC)

In the deepest reaches of one of the City's iron mines, two of the Steam Heros - Gerald and Professor Frederic - have crawled through a narrow tunnel into the interior of a large geode, packed with quartz crystals. Meanwhile, the remainder of the party, along with mine foreman Moses Winston, prepare for something that is approaching through the dimly-lit galleries and shafts.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "May I have basic speeds for Wulfgang and Alec please."

> (OOC) Alec says, "speed 6.0 dx 12"

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Spd 5 DX 10"

> (OOC) TysGM will be ready in a moment

> (OOC) Alec says, "If we've been expecting trouble, Alec will have his sword planted or propped up as the ground provides, shield next to it, ready to be grabbed. rifle will be out and loaded"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "You have time to prepare. Alec won't hear what's coming but everyone else will, and it seems to be coming from both directions anyway."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "What type of sword you using? Also, is Wulfgang using a staff or something else?"

> (OOC) TysGM Shall assume 'staff' since that's what he's got skillz for.

> (OOC) Alec says, "I have a shortsword and light shield. also Winchester M1873 chambered for .440-40, and a Colt Navy pistol as backup"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "We should go over spending points after this arc. Wulfgang's got 29 unspent."

> (OOC) Wulfgang will has a staff

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Anyway. Order is... everyone on 6, including Alec, Cassandra, and THEM;"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Then the foreman; then Wulfgang. So. Round one."

> (OOC) Alec says, "k, how many of what, and how far?"

The sound they make is a skittering and slithering that is difficult to localize underground. It seems to be coming from both directions, east and west, thought lighting is better to the west; the first of them comes into view, at a distance of about fifty yards back down the tunnel. Their precise shape is hard to make out: perhaps three in number, a bit smaller than a man, but topped with several thick, waving tentacles that turn the lamplight into horrid shadows.

> (OOC) Alec says, "my action: Aim at the first one I can see from the west."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "You have four turns until they are in melee range. They are moving fast, right towards you."

> (OOC) Alec says, "also: what cover options do we have?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Not a lot. They kept the floor here free of detritus so they could get the minecarts through.... hmmm."

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Are there traintracks/carttracks? Like steel?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Yes, they are."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "There's a pair of empty carts that have been taken off the rails here. They're not the best cover but it is all you've got."

> (OOC) Alec says, "assume I'll be using them then."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK. Alec hides behind one of the carts with a big gun and aims. Next on list: Cassandra. She's armed with a rapier; she'll stay back with the foreman and keep him covered. Because he's got the light source, and is armed with... let's see...."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "A discarded pick. Goes without saying that he's not a combat monster."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "That brings us to those. They're running at you from the west and cover 12 yards. They are now 36 yards distant. They are not any prettier."

> (OOC) Wulfgang will be moving next to the cart where Alec is, staff at the ready, as I have been instructed. Still an ameture, of course.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Wulfgang?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK. Posing."

A pair of disused mine carts are the only cover available. Alec takes up a position behind one, steadying his rifle over its top. He centers one of the approaching shapes in the weapon's iron sights. Wulfgang, carrying the iron-shod staff given him by his father, crouches behind the other. Cassandra sticks close to Moses Winston, though it's obvious that the girl will be protecting him. Her rapier sings a high note as she draws it from the sheath; the mine foreman finds only a discarded pickaxe. And he looks none too certain of its martial application.

Meanwhile, the shapes advance, as fast as a man can run. They pass from the bright pool of one lantern into the next, the shadows on the wall knotting weirdly from their rolling, flailing gait.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Round 2. Actually, please tell me what you'll do for round 2 and 3, since they can't attack you before then."

> (OOC) Alec says, "I'm morally certain these guys are attacking us, so Self-Defense passes. taking my shot on round 2, aiming on round 3."

> (OOC) Wulfgang is bacially braced for melee at this point.

> (OOC) Alec says, "Actually round 3 is me dropping rifle and grabbing sword."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Alec, take your shot. Add accuracy, since you aimed, and subtract 5, since they are 36 yards away. I should take off for their speed but they aren't evading."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "You can take the full ROF if you want."

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Relative speed is zero anyway."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Also, add 1 for being braced."

> (OOC) Alec says, "if they're 36 yards, that's -8. even if they moved first, that's 24 yards or -7."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK, I read the wrong row on the table. If you want to make it harder. c\_c"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "I make your to-hit as 10."

> (OOC) Alec says, "base skill 13, -8, +5 for acc (I have a scope), +1 for bracing is 11"

> (OOC) Alec rolls 3d for 12 (4 3 5) vs. 11, failing by 1

Alec takes his shot, unsuccessfully, and reaches for his sword, resting propped against the mine-cart. "What's our exit?" he calls over his shoulder at Moses.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Want to take the second shot with -2 for recoil? Your weapon has an ROF of 2."

> (OOC) Alec rolls 3d for 15 (4 5 6) vs. 9, failing by 6

> (OOC) Alec says, "not really how ROF works but okay."

"They're in it," Moses calls back, pointing at the advancing shapes. "But we might be able to get out that way!" He points again, this time at a nearby narrow tunnel that leads north off the main corridor.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "To refresh your memory: http://pandoraslair.org/sites/default/files/UniversityMineMap1\_2\_Mid\_Galleries.jpg"

> (OOC) Alec says, "and where are we on this?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Fredric and Gerald are in the crumbling chamber in the southeast (north is up.) You guys are right outside the single tunnel leading to it, or if you prefer, one square west of that, nearer the t-junction."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Squares are six yards."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "This east-west tunnel is six yards wide, or more, all the way back to the exit at the western edge of the map. Not all tunnels are the full six hards wide, though."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Anything else?"

> (OOC) Alec says, "nyet. we're about to be overrun so we need to fall back."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "At the end of round 2, they are 24 yards away. Alec readies his melee weapons; everyone else is still readied; at the end of round 3, they will be 12 yards (2 squares) away. That is the last window that you will be able to run down another corridor before they get there."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Your sister seems inclined to follow your lead. Run (which way), or stand and fight?"

> (OOC) Alec says, "still not certain about numbers?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "It is clear that three are approaching from the west."

> (OOC) Alec says, "k."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "You see no signs of others approaching from the west."

"Fall back then!" barks Alec, gesturing north.

> (OOC) TysGM hmm.

Wulfgang grips his staff in his hands, and gestures along, "Come on!" He calls, looking warily at the oncoming things.

> (OOC) Alec says, "I know, worst tactical choice of all."

The northern tunnel is narrower than the main gallery, and not as well-lit... but it is passable. The mine foreman leads the way, followed by Cassandra, Wulfgang, and Alec. The advancing creatures arrive at the junction just moments after Alec leaves it; they spend a precious second flailing tentacles against the places where everyone was just standing... attacking? Tasting? Who can say? But they're back in pursuit soon enough.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Your slowest member moves at 5; they move at 6. You were at 12 meters and they stopped for a second, so assuming you're hauling ass, your range is now 22."

"There's a crawlway ahead!" the foreman calls hoarsely. "Through a rubble-pile!"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "This is something that doesn't appear on the map. Said crawlway goes east through the wall of the tunnel you are in, and comes out in the partially-crumbled chamber near the map's center. If you keep running, you can enter it at the end of next turn."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "What next?"

"Take it," Alec replies, looking down the tunnel intently. If the party can avoid being trapped in a pincer - and if they can keep the creatures from going after Gerald and Fredric - then so much the better.

Wulfgang turns to Alec, "Maybe you can stop and fire on them from the crawlway." He suggests, his hand moving out to grab Cassandras as they retreat, "Come on!"

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "That should say 'you' not 'we'.. I'm going to fix."

> (OOC) Alec says, "basically I'm trying to find us a spot in the tunnels where a tunnel widens out. we'll hang out in the wider area and choke them with the tunnel"

> (OOC) Alec says, "the crawlway seems our best bet for that right now"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "The crawlway - or its exit - is as you describe."

> (OOC) TysGM hmm.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Can I have DX checks from everyone?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "In this order: Cassandra, Wulfgang, foreman, Alec"

> (OOC) Alec rolls 3d for 13 (4 4 5) vs. 12, failing by 1

> (OOC) Alec sorry. -\_-

> (OOC) TysGM rolls 3d6 for 15 (5 5 5)

> (OOC) TysGM rolls 3d6 for 11 (3 2 6)

> (OOC) Gerald says, "You forgot the fifth member of the party - Charlie Foxtrot."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK. You do not exactly get through the crawlway acrobatically. Nor do you get hung up. So here is how things stand on the other side of the rubble pile:"

> (OOC) Wulfgang rolls 3d6 for 13 (3 5 5)

> (OOC) Wulfgang has a fail too.

The 'crawlway' must have, at another time, been a much larger passage. It seems to have filled up with silt and gravel, though, until there isn't quite enough headroom to move at a crouch. It's claustrophobic, footing is unsure, and some of the rocks are quite sharp. It seems to take minutes, through it must only be a few seconds, before everyone tumbles down the gravel heap on the far side, dusty, bruised, and cut. The single saving grace is that the monsters don't find it easy going either, and seem to be attempting the passage only one at a time. By the moment everyone is righted, a fresh slide of gravel indicates the approach of the first of the tentacled beasts.

> (OOC) Alec says, "good. now we start shooting. -\_-"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "For sake of simplicity: You are on your feet and ready, in whatever formation you wish, and there is one monster at a range of five yards."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Alec, you and Cassandra go first. Hit it with your best shot."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "No modifiers for size or speed. Range is -2."

> (OOC) Alec says, "snap shot with skill 13, range 5 yd = effective 11. with a turn to aim it's 16."

> (OOC) Alec rolls 3d for 6 (1 3 2) vs. 11, succeeding by 5

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Do damage."

> (OOC) Alec says, "damage is 3d+1 pi+ (so 3d+1, x1.5 after DR unless they have some special resistance"

> (OOC) Alec rolls 3d+1 for 10 (2 5 2 1) damage

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Wulfgang, you can engage if you walk up to it. That will put you closer to the monsters than Alec, but you can attack this turn."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "They have some resistance, but not that much. Damage round up or down?"

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "That's fine. Is cassy going?"

> (OOC) Alec says, "round down"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK. You did 13."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "And it fails its health check. The first one is down and seems to be expiring messily."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Cassy would go before you, but didn't. She seems to be waiting for them to come to her."

> (OOC) TysGM poses results of gunshot.

The sound Alec's rifle is loud - deafening in such cramped spaces. But the shot strikes home, causing a fearsome wound in the first creature to emerge from the crawlway. The thing lets out an inhuman shriek and tumbles down the slope, thrashing frantically and leaving a slick of reddish-purple blood.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "You gonna go, Wulfgang? Otherwise it's next round."

> (OOC) Wulfgang is going.

> (OOC) Wulfgang rolls 3d6 for 5 (3 1 1) vs. 9, succeeding by 4

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Okay? I move up and hit something, yes?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Defense roll. It can only dodge."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Well... Alec just killed one, but there's two more coming."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Do you want to finish off the one he just shot, or wait for the next one?"

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Wait for the next one, please."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK. You can save that to-hit roll."

Two more beasts appear at the top of the rubble heap. They're moving more slowly, as if they're aware of the harm done to their sibling, and are moving more cautiously.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Alec, if I'm getting this right, Wulfgang just did a step and hold. He's at the end of the round. If this is another round, do you go again before he does?"

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "I can hold my action until it would become my turn again, so yes."

> (OOC) Alec says, "His Wait triggers whenever the action he Waited for takes place."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Then he gets the first crack at these."

> (OOC) Alec says, "correct."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK. They have a basic move of 6, which gives a dodge of 9."

> (OOC) TysGM rolls 3d6 for 10 (6 2 2)

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Failed to dodge. Wulfgang, do your damage."

> (OOC) Wulfgang rolls 1d6+2 for 6 (4 2)

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "A Swing. Posing:"

Wulfgang moves up to the opening, waiting for another to emerge. As one charges through the opening, Wulfgang swings his staff, and connects squarely in the stomach of the first to emerge.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Splat."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "It takes 5. It is still moving."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Then this happens."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Cassandra steps up and tries to stick the thing with her rapier. Apparently she was waiting on you, or didn't expect you to move forward."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Wulfgang, you're not really sure, but you think that she might be doing this to protect you."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Anyway. Her to-hit is 12."

> (OOC) TysGM rolls 3d6 for 8 (1 6 1)

> (OOC) TysGM says, "She hits. Does it dodge? Well, no, it tried to dodge Wulfgang and failed."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Damage."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Or rather, default crappy defense roll, in case it gets lucky."

> (OOC) TysGM rolls 3d6 for 8 (3 4 1)

> (OOC) TysGM says, "It didn't. Damage"

> (OOC) TysGM rolls 1d-1 for 0 (1 -1)

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Nothing. Well that was impressive."

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Isn't 1d-1 minimum 1? and what's her str anyway?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "str 9. And even if she did 1, they have dr 1."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Rapier is a thrusting weapon, thrust +1 . str 9 says she's got 1d-2 for thrusting damage. So... 1d-1."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Anyway..."

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Okay okay"

Cassandra emits an takes three quick steps and is suddenly standing right next to Wulfgang. She stabs forward with her rapier, uttering an unladylike curse, but it seems like a hurried move, and glances off the thing's tough hide.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Alec. Go ahead. Then cassandra again, then two monstas, then Wulfgang."

> (OOC) Alec says, "there's a third one, unwounded? aiming at that one, bracing against the tunnel walls if I can."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK. You can take the aim and braced bonuses. Range will still be 5 yards."

> (OOC) Alec says, "k. that gives them a round to finish this one off, I think?"

> (OOC) TysGM tries Cassandra again

> (OOC) TysGM says, "It could go that way, yes."

> (OOC) TysGM rolls 3d6 for 15 (4 6 5)

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Swing and a miss. I won't make a second pose for it. Now they go."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Cassandra and Wulfgang are in melee with one, which Wulfgang has injured. Even it goes after her, odd it goes after him."

> (OOC) TysGM rolls 1d6 for 4 (4)

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Even. It flails at her."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "To-hit of 12, natural weapons."

> (OOC) TysGM rolls 3d6 for 9 (5 2 2)

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Hits. Cassandra will attempt a parry."

> (OOC) Alec says, "so it doesn't take shock penalties for havin been hit earlier? :)"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Well, no, she won't parry, it's the same as her dodge."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Hmm. Well, it took 5..."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK, guess that's a miss instead. But it didn't fall over from shock."

> (OOC) TysGM poses

The beast returns the favor, flailing at Cassandra with three of its thick, writhing limbs, but she's fortunate enough to stay out of its way.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "That was #2. #3 is following its dead friend down the slope towards Alec."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "This is a Move and Attack. It gets a single attack against Alec with a penalty of -4."

> (OOC) TysGM rolls 3d6 for 9 (4 2 3)

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Fails to hit. The foreman COULD have a go with his pick, but he doesn't. Wulfgang, you're up. You're welcome to lay into #2 with your stick again."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "And when this fight is done, we'll give a look-in on Gerald and Fredric."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Wulfgang?"

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Sorry."

> (OOC) Wulfgang rolls 3d6 for 12 (3 3 6)

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "That's a miss, most likely."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Yes."

> (OOC) Wulfgang will pose.

Wulfgang notices Cassandra walk up beside him, her sword flaining out against the thing with a florish. He's so caught up my Cassandra's intrusion, that he times his next swing against the thing wrong, and his staff bounces against the cave wall.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Top of the round. Alec."

> (OOC) Alec says, "takin' my shot. 5 yards is -2, skill 13 + acc 5, effective 16"

> (OOC) Alec says, "17 with brace, but that doesn't matter."

> (OOC) Alec rolls 3d for 15 (6 5 4) vs. 17, succeeding by 2

> (OOC) Alec rolls 3d+1 for 14 (5 3 5 1) damage

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Well, he tried to hit you, so he's at 1 yd range now. Not that it would have stopped you."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "14 - 1 is 13, \* 1.5 = 19. That's more than twice its hit points in one shot. It is dead."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Gonna keep going the rest of the turn to see if Cassandra or Wulfgang gets the bragging rights for #2. Alec, please pose the death of #3."

> (OOC) TysGM rolls 3d6 for 5 (2 2 1)

> (OOC) TysGM rolls 3d6 for 10 (1 4 5)

> (OOC) TysGM rolls 1d6-1 for 0 (1 -1)

Alec braces his rifle against the mine shaft's walls, swiveling it carefully. As the third creature draws near enough to strike, he fires with calm precision. The thing slumps over immediately.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Cassandra hits and does nada."

> (OOC) TysGM rolls 3d6 for 11 (2 5 4)

> (OOC) TysGM says, "It fails to hit back."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Wulfgang: Try to kill it. We can assume you'll win, but I'd like to know who finishes it."

> (OOC) Wulfgang rolls 3d6 for 9 (2 4 3)

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "That's exactly my skill. Do I hit?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Yes."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Does it dodge?"

> (OOC) TysGM rolls 3d6 for 15 (4 6 5)

> (OOC) Wulfgang rolls 1d6+2 for 5 (3 2)

> (OOC) TysGM says, "no. Do damage."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "It is at 0hp."

> (OOC) TysGM rolls 3d6 for 9 (2 4 3)

> (OOC) TysGM says, "It succeeds its health check. But basically, it's going to go down in short order."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Fight over. Posing."

With a last breath, and also from having been caught crimson-cheeked next to Cassandra, his staff raises above Wulfgang's head, and he plants it down with a fiberous squeltch into the last of the approaching things.

Alec glances around, taking stock. "Any others?" he asks tensely.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "... impressively lurid. o\_o"

There is no sound to be heard at the moment, save the labored breathing of the Steam Heros and their guide...

> (OOC) TysGM rolls 3d6 for 16 (6 5 5)

> (OOC) TysGM rolls 3d6 for 12 (4 6 2)

> (OOC) TysGM rolls 3d6 for 9 (4 3 2)

> (OOC) TysGM poses, apology for pre-emption

> (OOC) TysGM rolls 3d6 for 13 (4 3 6)

A moment later, Cassandra and Wulfgang both hear the same noise, distant and faint, and look at each other. "Gunshots," she whispers. "It must be Fredric!"

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "It's SO HARD to not. I sware I'm not trying. cc."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "'Have you ever been with a warrior woman?'"

"Right. Let's move." Alec hustles.

---

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Dun dun duuuuun."

Moses Winston leads the way back down side-corridors to the main gallery. Within a minute, you're back at the junction where the fight started. The narrow tunnel leading off into the great geode is at waist-height in the south wall. The dirt there has been disturbed... something else has passed through since you were last here, and it wasn't Fredric or Gerald.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Speaking of which...."

---

Gerald is... somewhere else. He remembers this place only dimly, from a midnight somnambulence in the lost city, several months and hundreds of dusty miles ago.

The distance to this place is not measured in miles, however. Nor can it be found on any map, though it is intimately linked to the World's geography in a way that Gerald doesn't... quite... grasp...

Still, Gerald recognizes the sensation. This crystal chamber, buried under a hill, is the same order of life as the blue crystal spires of the lost city, and the flitting sphere that he keeps in his lab. A form of life that is not part of the natural order - _any_ natural order, green or red. But somehow, it brought natural order to be in this place.

Gerald can't feel his own heartbeat anymore, nor feel his own breath. He can, however, hear the voice of this thing, weak though it is. It knows he has a question to ask, and it is ready to answer.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "So. This is a kind of divination. What do you want to know?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "This is directed at Gerald, btw."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "I was having trouble coming up with this last week. z.z"

> (OOC) Gerald says, "In /general/ terms, what I want to know is how best to contain the red life in this mine. I'm having trouble formulating anything more specific than that..."

> (OOC) TysGM hmm

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Roll your considerable IQ."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "what's the command for the target number?"

> (OOC) Alec says, "roll 3d on 14"

> (OOC) Alec says, "or whatever the number is"

> (OOC) Gerald rolls 3d for 15 (6 6 3) vs. 12, failing by 3

> (OOC) TysGM says, "That's... not great. :/"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Still, it has an answer for you."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "In that case, I'll simply consider myself asking the question directly, and expecting a vague answer at best. ^^"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Pose the ask, then."

What Gerald feels is something almost akin to stage fright. Even after the lost city - or perhaps _because_ of it - he finds himself at a loss to formulate the problem at hand with the usual clarity. He eventually settles for the direct question: 'What is the best way for us to contain the red life that has become disturbed in these caves?'

The thing to which Gerald is speaking - the 'blue spirit' - thinks very slowly; so slowly that swifter forms of life - such as himself - wouldn't even recognize it as thought. Even by its own standards, this thing has been long-dormant and buried, and is barely awake now.

And that makes the answer all the more impressive. It's a sudden torrent of thoughts that Gerald can barely tolerate. If his mind had touched such a thing when it was at full-strength, it would have been maddening... mind-breaking.

But all the right things happened today. In this sunless labyrinth, the crystal being is barely awake, and Gerald remembers the obelisks of the lost city. He can comprehend the nature and scope of the answer, if not all the details. The crystal beings changed the planet over thousands of years - from a hellish red, to a blue-green paradise where men now thrive. This being was one small part of the plan. It fell here from high in the sky, landing in an ancient bog. It spread seeds of its own design, awakening _green_ in the land where once _red_ held sway.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Two more."

Gerald realizes that, in those days, the red life was not awake and aware. The betentacled, barrel-shaped beasts, though clearly the same type of life, were not present when the sphere fell from the sky. The things that used to live in the bog were sessile - great, fleshy, fernlike plants in blacks, reds, and purples. The ground underfoot was laced with something akin to mushrooms - vast mats of simple vegetation without distinct individuals.

The central thread of the crystal's answer is: _There was a plan of pacification (bring the world to order. bring the makers back to life. bring breath-of-earth to this place.) We awaken the green (seeds of earth. cells of earth. <disease?> of earth. <serum?> of earth. the mind of earth awakens in this place) and cause slumber in the red. It was successful (ten thousand turnings of the sun. makers breath the air and know not from whence they came.) If the native life is resurgent, execute the plan once more._ But these thoughts are only the currents in the torrent: to write down as words, all the thoughts for which they are a capstone, would fill many libraries.

A final thought comes to Gerald, clearer than all the others: _Do not disturb the red. Cover it over simply, with stone and water and green. It may have its world back, but not until you are done with it._

> (OOC) TysGM says, "You will be waking up shortly. Anything else you want to try?"

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Not really. All I'd have would be a closing pose."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "At least, closing the scene."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Go ahead, then."

Understanding the work of the Crystals, Gerald realizes, will be a lifetime's work - but for now, at least, he has some idea in which direction to turn his studies. As he allows the rapport to fade, retreating from the torrent of knowledge, his final thought is: _I don't think the foreman's going to like this answer..._

As Gerald returns to an understanding of his own flesh and blood, he is aware that there are sounds in his ears... familiar sounds... violent sounds... weapons. A firearm, discharging. Fredric's revolver.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "We'll be ending soon."

> (OOC) Alec says, "we need to find Fredric & Gerald asap"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "That would likely mean following them down the chute. Anyone want to go?"

> (OOC) Alec will be doing so :P

> (OOC) TysGM says, "In that case..."

> (OOC) Alec says, "(and calling out that I am, so they don't shoot me)"

Alec squeezes his way through the narrow tunnel, but is forced to stop when he encounters one of the creatures wedged into the tunnel in front of him... dead, and covered in its own blood. He calls out to Fredric, and after a few momenths the body is removed. He emerges into the crystal chamber - impressively brilliant, even in lamplight, but marred by carnage. Two of the beasts are here, both dead. The professor looks somewhat worse for the wear: his clothing is dishevellend and torn in many places. He breathes raggedly and open-mouthed, and his face is bruising as if he were slapped by something large and heavy, with his nose bleeding and obviously broken. In one hand he holds a revolver; in the other, a long and bloody knife. The air in here is thick with the smell of blood and gunsmoke. "Gerald's fine," he croaks. "Can we leave?"

> (OOC) Alec says, "Pausing to administer first aid."

> (OOC) Alec says, "aside from that I got nothin. that seems like a good closer."

Wulfgang looks at Fredric, "Well, for now, that might be prudent.."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Alright. You'll reach the surface without difficulty."
