# University of Tys 2010-12-30

> (OOC) Log "Tys-2010-12-30" started by TysGM at Thu Dec 30 21:12:12 2010 CST (OOC)

It's late afternoon on the surface, and the exit of the Team Heroes from the mine is a dramatic picture. Choi and Winston carry Frederic between them; the professor is bloodied, bruised, and limping. Others in the party smell of gunsmoke and alien blood. The only one who is untouched is Gerald, who only recently awakened from a trance.

Many of the miners are on hand to see this. The roughnecks and diggers keep a respectful distance, murmuring to each other. "Did ya get it?" a few ask. "Is it dead?" A few loud discussions open up around the camp, seeming to involve articles of faith, union rules on mine safety, and the difference between an 'exorcism' and a 'brawl'.

"We shot a few," Alec answers. "Might be more."

Wulfgang looks at the miners, then at Alec, "Investigations are still proceeding." He says, gruffly.

One of the miners near the front of the pack, shorter and louder than the others, manages to get himself heard. "But hey, you shot them, so guns work on them, right? That's all it takes?"

Though Gerald is physically unharmed, his face is pale and drawn. "The important thing..." he says softly, "is to seal the hole. There are many more below, and they must not come to the surface. Once it is sealed, the ones below will sleep once more."

"Let's get inside," Frederic manages to say. "Talk then."

> (OOC) TysGM assumes...

---

It looks like the mine office will be a temporary camp of sorts. A room in the back has a small coal stove and bunks for the clerks; Frederic slumps into one of these, carrying his hip flask. The hubbub in the camp seems likely to continue for some time. The foreman sums it up. "If they know they can kill it with rifles, they might be inclined to try," he says. "So what do I tell them?"

"Tell 'em they'll run out of bullets and then be overrun," suggests Alec.

Wulfgang looks, "Well, you can lie and say that we use Magic rifles impused with awesome cosmic power." He grins an silly grin, "Or you can tell them that we're going to take care of it a different way. THe way I figure, if they think someone ELSE will take care of it, they'll be less inclined to try."

Wulfgang looks at Gerald. "Welcome back. You were perhaps saying something about sealing them in?"

Gerald blinks and raises his head. "Yes. The... crystal geodes are like the crystals we saw before. Their job was to bury the creatures and send them into sleep. If we seal the hole that the miners opened - the one where the ammonia stench came from - the creatures left inside will sleep again. After that... there can't be _that_ many creatures who've come up just yet?"

The foreman rubs his chin. "We'll... we've got rifles, and could seal the tunnel in the mid galleries easy enough... but are you sure that will keep them down there?"

> (OOC) Gerald says, "That /was/ basically what the crystal told me, isn't it?"

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "They don't seem inclined to try and get their way out."

> (OOC) TysGM rereads log to make sure he got it right.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "The crystals did say 'Cover it over simply, with stone and water and green'. So simply burying it and forgetting about it, sounds viable to you."

Gerald nods. "Yes. That is what the vision said." He scratches his head. "From a mundane perspective... I'd guess it's our air that irritates them, just like theirs irritates us." He looks toward the tunnel entrance. "What worries me... are you planning any other expansion of the mines?"

The foreman points to the roll of maps, still on the table. "We were digging iron. That mostly goes back into the hill, to the north, and at a fairly high plane. This stuff we were finding in the middle galleries... the quartz, jade, and silver... well..." he shrugs. "We don't _have_ to dig it. We just... want to. It's worth a lot more than iron."

Wulfgang looks at the foreman, "How many more men's worth that iron is it? Because that seems to be the primary choice you have..."

Gerald stares at the map, almost sleepily. "There... may be a way. It depends on how big the vault is." He rubs his forehead. "I may be able to tell you where you must not dig. After I've had some rest, of course. And once we've cleared the mid galleries."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Would Earth Vision allow me to tell the difference between rock and not-rock? i.e. could I use it to see the boundaries of the vault?"

"Rest is good," Frederic mumbles. "Rest and whiskey. And maybe check if I've got any cracked ribs.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Hmm. That's a good one. Let's see."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "p.51 GURPS Magic"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Formal description is that earth and uncut stone are transparent, stone and metal are opaque. So I'm going to say that if you succeed with both the spell and perception checks, you can judge areas of higher or lesser density, and determine if there's a clean barrier of the type you're looking for."

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Clearly your services would be contracted from teh University. c.c"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Does Gerald have any actual geology or metallurgy? Let's see."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "I don't believe I do."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Nope. I'd be limping along at my default, which wouldn't be reliable enough."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "I don't have GURPS magic handy. 9\_9 But Bill was asking about using spirits to divine the location of precious metals within the earth, and that was possible. So I think this should be, too."

> (OOC) Alec says, "PDF is available on the usual site."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "We'll call it straight Perception, then. I don't see any other things on your sheet to provide bonuses or pentalties."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Anyone else want to weigh in on this?"

> (OOC) Alec says, "the interaction of powers with abilities usually boils down to a tools bonus - if you have a superpower that subs in for tools for a task, it's +0 (if you are making do with the power instead of normal tools), +2 (if the power is as good as high-quality tools) and +4 (if the power is superior to any possible tool)."

Wulfgang looks at Frederic and Gerald, "Of course, the University might require research materials and time to perform such a feat."

> (OOC) Alec says, "The question being asked here is 'can I see the boundaries of the vault'. That sounds like a basic Perception challenge, and Earth Vision provides him the mechanism to do so. If the question were more complicated, and actually involved actual geology (e.g. 'what are the qualities of the surrounding rock'), that would seem to call for a skill roll."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Trying to find the actual quartz, jade, and other valuable deposits /would/ require a skill roll. Distinguishing rock from not-rock... what Alec said."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "I'm not sure how to interpret that. Short of digging up the whole hill, no tool is going to let you do this. But it seems like a pretty big application."

"Ahhh," Moses replies. "That sounds like a _quid pro quo_, Master Stentz."

Wulfgang shrugs, "Maybe so. Maybe so.."

> (OOC) Alec says, "what I'm saying is that 'can I see X' is generally answered with a Per roll, which anyone can do. If he was asking 'can I distinguish trained quality X', that's a skill roll, BUT being able to simply see it all in his field of vision is an awesome tool for that skill."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Here's the proposal. Spend 10 energy to give me fifty yards' worth of Earth Vision, then look in every direction for thirty seconds. If I assume that the void in the rock starting from the breach is the red-life vault, I can determine that much of the boundaries of the vault."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Worst case, I discover that the vault goes as far as I can see in any direction, and we tell the foreman to give up on the mid galleries."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "50 yards isn't very far underground, but it might be enough. It will give you a good chunk of the map as it is on the site."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "So shall we call that a plan? Although I want to finish Wulfgang's negotiation here."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Well, I can also make an attempt once every 100 minutes, so I can map out 3-4 different spheres in a day, depending on my luck."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "We'll call it a +2 then, and we'll be making the rolls shortly."

Wulfgang looks at the foreman, "Look. What I need is iron. What the Univertisy wants, is it's iron. Maybe we can get you your map, and we can get our iron. ANd believe me, if what we're doing goes off, Iron might be more valuable than quartz."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Give me a Diplomacy roll, take a +3. So you've got 14."

> (OOC) Wulfgang rolls 3d6 for 13 (5 4 4)

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Ha ha. Well. It's a success. So..."

Winston nods. "Alright. You tell us where to dig, and where not to dig. We'll plug the hole we opened, and stay out of the monsters' way. And then we all get paid."

Wulfgang nods. "Alright."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Gerald, if 10 energy == 10 fatigue, you're going to be exhausting yourself every time you do this trick. Is that what you intend?"

> (OOC) Gerald says, "I can put it down to 8 fatigue and cut my range to 40 yards."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "The range is 10 yards per 2 FP."

> (OOC) Alec says, "hay GM, any reason Gerald can't use ceremonial magic?"

> (OOC) Alec says, "if he can, how many miners are willing to participate in a ceremony?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "After appropriate reassurances, most of them. :)"

> (OOC) Alec says, "each of them can contribute 1 FP to the effort. cast time is x10 but Earth Vision shouldn't be that long to cast."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "You've got about fifty-odd people here, mostly men of different ages."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "All true. So this is a better plan, and it would let you get it all in one go. And be appropriately impressive. I approve this plan."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "IIRc, you need a roll for the ceremony and a roll for the spell, right?"

> (OOC) Alec says, "no, there's one leader and he rolls his usual skill."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "It's also possible to divert excess energy into improving the skill roll."

---

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Well. Either I can pose the setup, or you can."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "I'll cover the result. Take yer pick, then make der roll. :)"

> (OOC) Gerald says, "We should probably cover the sealing first, at least in pose form. With a whole army of guys with rifles, clearing through to the breach and mopping up should be straightforward."

> (OOC) TysGM hmm

> (OOC) Gerald in the meantime, works on poses for the ceremony.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Alec, you mind if I use you to lead the militia?"

> (OOC) Alec says, "goferit"

A few worthies are found among the miners who are willing to help close the well leading from the middle galleries to whatever lies below. Alec again leads them into the tunnels. A dozen more of the tentacled beasts are found roaming the mines, and are dispatched. The mouth of the well lies in the center of a large, ovoid chamber at the eastern edge of the middle galleries. What is visible, is a single large tubule, wide as a man is tall, and lined with glittering flecks of mica and quartz. There's no need to venture within; a gang of workers maneuvers boulders into place and collapses supports to reseal the well.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Meanwhile, topside, Gerald. Go."

As the militia returns from the expedition, Gerald passes out candles to them, as well as to the miners who remained topside. Once all the workers are assembled, he turns to address them - acutely aware of his youth. "You all have a lot of experience with this place. Much more than I do, I'm certain. So, in a way, I'm borrowing a bit of your experience with this ceremony. When I give the signal, light your candle and concentrate on the flame. Think about working the mine - how hard or soft the rock is, the sound of your pick hitting stone... that sort of thing."

One of the miners raises his hand. "I don't understand what yer doin' here. What's gonna happen? Are we gonna have more weird dreams, like when those critters came up?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Was that Gerald posing that? If so, keep going, just curious."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Yeah, that was me."

> (OOC) Gerald is used to taking a few liberties with the free posing. Like this one:

Gerald rubs his chin. "Well... I've never done this before. Not with a group," he begins, as Frederic and Wulfgang slap their hands to their foreheads. "But I'm pretty sure you won't feel anything much, except a little tired. Perhaps... perhaps you might just get a vague sense of... I don't know how to say it. The texture of the world? And it will pass quickly."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "I like this. Keep it up."

There is some muttering amongst the workers, but Winston gives them a look, and says, "Just do what the kid says, and we'll get it over with." The muttering dies down, and Gerald takes a seated position, several of the quartz crystals planted in the ground in a circle around him. He looks around him, his face suddenly taking on a serene expression that belies his youth. "Begin," he says.

And as the miners begin to concentrate, Gerald closes his eyes. This is quite different than in the crystal chamber below - as before, he is opening his mind to the world around him, but this time, rather than the focused thoughts of the crystals, he is simply seeking to hear - or rather, to see - the thoughts of the rock itself. And by extension, to see where the rock is not.

> (OOC) Gerald says, "And that's the end of the posing."

> (OOC) TysGM hmm.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK, give me the roll for the spell, with the +2."

> (OOC) Gerald rolls 3d6 for 15 (6 5 4) vs. 14, failing by 1

> (OOC) Gerald says, "This may take a couple of tries. c.c"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Give me another try, We'll just say that it takes longer."

> (OOC) Gerald rolls 3d6 for 16 (6 5 5) vs. 14, failing by 2

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Oh come on."

> (OOC) TysGM 9\_9

> (OOC) TysGM says, "One more. But after that long the miners are probably going to get upset."

> (OOC) Gerald rolls 3d6 for 9 (3 1 5) vs. 14, succeeding by 5

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Good."

It takes... longer than anticipated. Gerald has never done this before, and the miners certainly haven't. There doesn't seem to be any steady rhythm to the chants or the prayers. Gerald's mind keeps wandering, and not in the way he wants.

But... after close to forty minutes... the ritual does seem to find its way. The quartz shards ringed around Gerald are from the very earth below his feet; and further, have given every sign of being part of a complex organism - if not a life form, then something very much like one - that never truly dies. And soon, the feeling of disappearing into it overtakes him.

The dirt below Gerald's feet seems to dissolve into a light mist, punctuated with darker nodes that he somehow knows to be boulders and veins of iron ore. The place is rife with it - the minders who founded this place, chose well.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "You will have to go into the mine to see everything. Even with 20 people backing you up, your range of 600 yards does not cover the whole thing. You would have known this, and planned for it - OOC I will tell you, they will see you sleepwalking. Are you OK with that?"

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Yes, I'm okay with this."

The miners see Gerald rise to his feet and walk towards the mine, one step at a time, eyes still closed. Cassandra and Wulfgang follow closely behind, but his footing seems sure and his direction deliberate. For several minutes he wanders the tunnels and galleries, never once opening his eyes, but never once tripping or walking into a wall. Gerald mutters as he walks - a steady stream of notes about the hidden layout of the mines. It's not the same as a trance: he's just totally occupied with his task.

Gerald discovers that the red life - whatever it is - is indeed buried. The hill under which they now stand covers what was once a massive bog, peat from which is quarried daily from nearby ares to fuel the furances of the City's industry. But nobody has encountered the tentacled beasts in those quarries. this place is somehow different: a junction of sorts, for something that Gerald can only conceive of as the 'roots of the world'. Here they cross, and here life quickens. "Maybe not just red life," the young sorceror murmurs. "Maybe any life..."

> (OOC) TysGM whoops.

> (OOC) TysGM removes.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "And then we have to call it."

"The crystals... shaped this place," Gerald can be heard to mutter, by the other Steam Heroes who escort him. "Much was buried. But... here," he says, pointing at the ground. "The red life is close to the surface. And here, and here. Map, map, give me a map..." he says, sticking out a hand.

Wulfgang hands him the chart of the mid galleries, and Gerald pulls it in front of him, half opening his eyes. Several sites are quickly marked in pencil - the plugged shaft, of course, but several other sites as well. A few more marks near the edge, some with numbers by them. "These. These are the places we must not dig, lest we disturb their slumber."

It takes more than one map, but Gerald does get the data down. There's no need for the mines to disturb the red life; and the foreman has assured the Steam Heroes that they won't. That will have to do for now.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Sorry, gotta go. :) Thanks guys."
