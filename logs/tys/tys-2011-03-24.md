# University of Tys 2011-03-24

Midsummer. It's hard to believe that everything that the Steam Heros has done, has occured in the five short months since Thawing. But happen it has; tales of adventure and steam have taken hold in the City; steam-boats now ply the river in both directions; and the railroad venture is putting down hundreds of feet of new track every day.

The financial prime movers of the rail venture are as important as its engines. These include Lord Fowler, whose parliamentary seat gives him influence among the landed; the Stentzes, for their influence among the iron and coal brokers; and a major banking house. Several new guilds have formed among the laborers who are making a career out laying track. And of course, there's the University, which is happy to see full employment for students of steam-engineering.

To celebrate the success, Lord Fowler has invited quite a few parties to an informal ball. It's supposed to be the first rail voyage from the City to his estate. This is something of a conceit; the railroad has been used to carry its own supplies for weeks. It will, however, be the first real passenger service, and that's enough to get some attention.

The Steam Heros have gathered at the newly-built 'passenger terminal' at the west side of the city, which is also near the very wharves and docks from which they launched their expedition. And it's not exaggerating to say that the building is new. It's really only a single large room, with an enclosed office for the stationmaster at one end. The walls are made of unpainted planks and still smell as though freshly cut. The varnish on the floors shows nary a scratch or scuff. The benches seem to have been moved here from some other waiting room. The doors on the near side swing open onto a cobbled section of the east-west highway; the doors on the far side slide open onto a broad, elevated rail platform.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "You are all here. If you want to chatter a bit, speak up; otherwise, moving you on."

> (OOC) Wulfgang will put something in here.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Cassandra and Fredric are also present. Wulfgang, your father is not. he may be avoiding you this morning."

Alec whistles appreciatively.

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "That's not a nice way to treat your sister, ALec."

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Oh right, I'm supposed to get married."

Wulfgang is obviously excited, his body bobbing on the seat, "Isn't this neat? Isn't this exciting?" He smiles, looking pointedly at Alex, and Gerald, and then his eyes scan over to Cassandra. He then frowns, and remembering the forgotten letter at home. He reaches into his pocket, and fingers the note.

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Is the train present yet?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Not yet. Some more people are supposed to show up, then the train with Fowler will come and take you all to la-la land... er... his house."

Gerald cranes his neck. "Yeah," he says. He looks excited too, although 'impatient' is a more accurate term, as he cranes his neck, looking along the empty track. As far as he's concerned, the star of today's show has yet to arrive: namely, the locomotive.

For her part, Cassandra is keeping quiet. She's been looking Wulfgang over expectantly, almost petulantly. Several times she's asked why the elder Stentz is absent, as if she were expecting to speak to him as well. More than a dozen other people arrive in the next half-hour; Wulfgang's father is not among them.

Alec scratches his chin. "Figure y'gotta keep the excitement goin," he suggests quietly to Gerald and Wulfgang. "Else people'll start lettin' the scared get to 'em."

Wulfgang just shrugs at Cassandra as she asks, shrugging as if he knows nothing. He says flatly, "There's bigger thing sto be scared of than several tonnes of barely held together steam powered iron, boys."

The train itself soon arrives. Everyone can feel it, before they can hear it; and hear it, before they can see it. The ground shakes in a way that is deeper and more regular than the volumes of cart traffic passing by the front door; this is soon replaced by the steady, distant chug of the steam engine, punctuated by the occasional high-pitched blast of the machine's whistle. The machine itself comes into view next: the squat, square profile of the engine, pushing clouds of grey smoke from its stack. It's pulling a coal tender, two passenger cars, and several unladen flatbed cars. As the train heaves to a stop next to the platform, Fowler himself leans from the passenger car and waves, to a smattering of applause.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Ping if you want to say something."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Otherwise, we'll be on rails for a bit."

> (OOC) Gerald doesn't have anythin at the moment

Fowler descends from the train to shake hands with his guests. Several more people have shown up, in twos and threes and fours. Fowler seems to recognize them all.

Wulfgang catches something out of the corner of his eye, someone stuffed in the corner a bit, a seemingly familiar face. He waves to the other guys, "Just a sec." As he wanders over to the gentleman, "Hi. I'm Wulfgang Stentz. I believe we've met?"

Wulfgang is talking to a man in his late 20's, who has been walking around the station - not speaking to anyone, not avoiding anyone, altogether too casual. His brown hair and nondescript face could fit in anywhere; his suit is of a cut that was popular four or five years ago. It's been well-cared for and mended a few times since - but most definitely not the level of clothing that most of Fowler's guests where. He startles as Wulfgang addresses him. "Oh! The younger Stentz," he brightens. "Yes, of course you'd be here. How have things gone since the Expedition?"

Wulfgang blinks, and looks at the man, "Well," Wulfgang gestures around himself, "THing seem to be going pretty well for us. At least so far nothing major has happened." He looks at the man more carefully, "What have you been up too?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Gerald, feel free to go drool over the train. It's one of your own designs. One of the simpler ones, sadly. There just isn't enough zirconium in town to handle the kind of steam pressures you really want to see."

"Oh. Well, reporting on the Summer of Steam." The young man catches Wulfgang's blank look, and continues. "For the paper. That I publish." A hurt expression flickers across his face as he retrieves a business card from a breast pocket and passes it over. It's fairly high-quality paper, with writing in raised ink: 'Isaiah Fields - Independent Press and Journal'. "I thought you remembered me," he explains.

Wulfgang frowns and shakes his head, truly distressed by this, "I'm sorry, I do not." He looks the card over carefully, and more than a little embarassed.

Alec has unobtrusively snuck up on the pair. "Perhaps Lord Fowler will remember ya better, sir," he suggests casually.

Fields startles again - skittish man, for a reporter. He turns to see Alec, obviously recognizing him as another of the Steam party. "I don't believe he has a subscription, sir, and I'm not on his guest list. But the station is a public building, and this is where his guests have chosen to muster." Fields points discreetly. "That man. Sabinian Clevon. Sits on the board of the second-biggest bank in the city, he can trace his line directly back to the first flotilla of settlers that came here from the West. And that one, over there," he gestures again. "Fauntgard. Head of the biggest Boatman's Association serving the northern townships. He's on board with this now, too." He eyes Wulfgang for a moment. "And the rumor is that it's after he spoke to you at a corner cafe in Government Square."

> (OOC) Alec has somethin here, but most of this is probably for Wulfgang

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Please feel free!"

Alec shrugs a little. "Well if you ain't invited, why be here with the folks who are? Why not just write whatever comes into your head like y'all usually do?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "'The hard-faced woman over there, runs an escort service in Arsunt. Very exclusive clientele. And that one over there - ' 'Spacing guild representative, how could I miss him?'"

Wulfgang's eyes flit over, and Wulfgang nods, looking back at Fields, "Politics is the grease of Industry. You seem to know this as well as anyone, I suspect." Sulfgang pauses, "Know more about these fine folk than I, anyway." Wulfgang looks over at Alec, makes a face, "Familiar with his work?"

> (OOC) TysGM hmm

> (OOC) Wulfgang idle just a bit for wife aggro.

Fields grins. "I never lie, and only rarely embellish. Why not invite me along, and then I'll have the facts?"

Alec hums. "Well, 'cause it ain't my house," he finally announces.

Wulfgang hrms, "I know who's house it is though." ANd Wulfgang starts over to Mr. Fields. He has a smirk on his face anyway. . o O ( I'll show my father to set me up... ) "Hey! Mr. Fowler! Can I add a late guest?" He calls over, mid-platform, and somewhat loudly, so at least a few others hear.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "I think you mean 'Fowler' on that second one, but OK."

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Oh certainyl I do, thanks. Fixed in log."

> (OOC) TysGM Moves Gerald's line here

> (OOC) Gerald says, "feel free to shuffle that around to wherever it needs to be"

Fowler has almost finished making his round of introductions among the bankers, merchants, and union leaders; Wulfgang's voice seems to free him from a round of pleasantries with Fauntgard the boatman. "Wulfgang!" he cries. "I thought I saw the Steam Heroes from the train!" He looks Fields over, and offers his hand. "I'm Aldous Fowler. Have we met? My uncle's done many deals with the University's press, you have the look about you."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Sure, thanks Gerald."

Fields' grin falters; he obviously hadn't expected Wulfgang to be so blatant, nor possibly for Fowler to hit so close to home. "Well, not _just_ the University's press, but I do business with them quite often. Mechanical printing's been a boon to small publishers," he adds, a bit weakly.

"Well," Fowler replies. "The Steam Heroes have quite a lot of staff these days, or so I hear from Mister Stentz. We've room for him, of course," he addresses Wulfgang, "but you can feel free to impinge on my household staff for the weekend as well. They're getting more used to sudden guests. Speaking of which..." The door has opened, admitting another well-to-do couple; Fowler moves off to greet them.

Meanwhile, in the absence of Frederick, or any other responsible adult, forcing Gerald to be sociable, the young engineer has made his way straight for the locomotive. It's not at its best when not in motion, but even now Gerald can appreciate the elegant simplicity of the design - even the otherwise-complicated gearbox is, to his eyes, a marvel of efficiency, in part count if perhaps not in power.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK. Say on, if you've got anything. :)"

Wulfgang smiles at Mr. Fields, "Well, come on along." He grins. The not so subtile jabs wern't really missed on Wulfgang, but what is he going to say. Wulfgang, seemingly having completed that transaction, moves back to Gerald and Cassandra, "Shall we aboard?"

Fields looks a bit shocked, but soon recovers. "Well. For once I don't have to gate-crash." He retrieves a small suitcase and follows the others on board.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Last words before <hr>?"

Gerald blinks, emerging partially from his engineer-trance. "What? Oh, yes, right," he says. There's a brief glance at Fields, but no comment.

> (OOC) Gerald is done

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK. A few things happen on the train..."

---

The passenger cars have large, well-padded bench seats on either side of a narrow aisle. Each car could probably hold an even forty people, but here's no passengers other than Fowler's guests, so they're only about half-full. There doesn't seem to be a conductor, so each party seems to settle in by itself or with chatty neighbors.

There's a few thumps as the engine disconnects from the head of the train, and a delay of a few minutes while it reverses, then passes the train on an adjacent rail... then a few more thumps as it joins the front of the train. A moment later, the whistle sounds; the passenger cars jolt and shudder; and the train is moving.

The trip of twenty-two miles would take nearly five hours by cart or carriage. The draft schedules, which have a ten-minute stop at each of five villages along the way, put the journey at ninety minutes. Today's special non-stop service will cover it in less than an hour, start to stop. A blue-uniformed conductor clicks a stopwatch as the train begins to move, and makes a notation on a clipboard. If it all goes according to plan, this will be a new record in passenger travel.

It's not a hard ride, but it's a shocking one for some. A few older passengers have white-knuckle grips on their seats; one older woman, the wife of Clevon the banker, looks like she might faint. There's a lot of noise from both the wheels and the engine, and the constant strong tang of burning carbon in the air. At least there's ventilation: pushing a window out a mere inch is like riding on horseback into a breeze, or facing into the wind on the deck of a ship.

It appears that Wulfgang's father did make the train; he arrived at the last minute, and boarded at the last minute. He's in the back of the third car, with a small group of guildmasters who are busily adapting card games designed shipboard play to railway use. He hasn't come forward to visit the University party yet. But it does seem that Cassandra has noted his presence. After a few minutes, she plops herself down into the seat exactly opposite Wulfgang and looks directly at him, for the first time in what might be days.

> (OOC) Alec says, "GM, taking the Aim maneuver."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Noted. We'll assume your powder is dry and your weapon oiled, since Wulfgang's involved."

> (OOC) TysGM whoops

"So, Wulfgang," she begins evenly. "Has your father given you any... courtship advice, of late?"

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Subtile like a steel trap. "

Wulfgang looks back at Cassandra, his little bit of 'mischief' putting him back on the happy side of things. The right corner of his lips draw up as Cassandra fires the first volley. And it's not a warning shot. "Oh, just mostly the normal dad talk." He says, looking into her eyes, speaking levelly. "And when it's my dad, he's lucky he stayed on course the whole time."

"No doubt," she says, not unamused. "He does like to take his time about making a point. But he... _did_ make a point, yes?"

Wulfgang sighs, "Yes yes." He reaches into his pocket, and fishes out the offending letter. "In writing and everything. Just like him." He tosses it lightly over to Cassandra.

Cassandra catches it, a sudden grin on her face. "Really? He did?" She almost squeaks as she reads it. Then she looks confused. "I... don't get it. This is a dossier for Fowler's sister-in-law." The look of horror starts somewhere between her eyes and spreads across her face like a brushfire. "No! He CAN'T be serious!"

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Oh good I didn't miss something."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "We're almost done for today, btw. But I want this part first."

Wulfgang's face is overcome with palor again, as he watchs Cassandra's reaction. No doubt he'll get blamed for some part of this too. "Who did what who now?" he asks. He didn't really expect to tall Cassandra in.. quite this way, but, there we go, "I'm..." He looks down and says lamely, "I'm sorry."

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "I more meant last tiem."

Cassandra looks like she might be turning red, and if her arm muscles are any indication, she's tensed up enough to punch out a horse. Her lips form the beginnings of several things that might be words. After a few seconds (though it seems much longer), she rises from her seat. In one smooth move, she retrieves a small packet of letters from her pocket and hurls them at Wulfgang, though not violently; it's more of an offhand toss as she charges off towards the rear of the train... where the older Stentz man is seated.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Any of you three that want to do something, you better declare it now, because she's not gonna stop for anyone."

> (OOC) Wulfgang is seeing how many people he can indirectly happen to today.

> (OOC) Alec is gonna follow if he sees this go down

> (OOC) Gerald has nothing. This looks like people stuff.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Everyone on the train is going to see this go down."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "And, Wulfgang? You're about to happen to your dad. By proxy."

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "That's what I meant!"

Wulfgang, knowing himself to be ultimately powerless to stop this, simply smirks to himself to how well this day is going, he's already indirectly happened to two people. Anyway, he thumbs through the letter so deposited in his lap, looking for answers. He stops, and watches Alec move, and decides it would be best to follow, and see father. In fact, he will try and take Cassandra by hand before the reaches the last car.

> (OOC) TysGM hmm

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Interesting. We have several things to adjudicate here."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Wulfgang, the letters were between Cassandra and her father, and her father and YOUR father. You can't really tell the contents at a glance, but you think she might have been asking her father to give his permission, to you, for you to court her. Which is a little weird; you're supposed to ask him, not her on your behalf. But it can happen."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "As to catching up to her... Alec, are you trying to /catch/ her or just follow?"

> (OOC) Alec says, "follow"

> (OOC) Alec says, "if anyone gets in her face, my job is to get them out again"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK. We're gonna roll a Quick Contest, then, DX vs DX, Wulfgang vs Cassandra. Alec's presence guarantees that there's no other players."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Wulfgang, roll vs. DX (10)"

> (OOC) Wulfgang rolls 3d6 for 12 (6 3 3) vs. 11, failing by 1

> (OOC) TysGM rolls 3d6 for 11 (1 4 6)

> (OOC) TysGM says, "She has a 10. So it's a close call. Here's what happens:"

Wulfgang follows Cassandra down the center aisle of the train, through one door, across the shaking platform between cars, and through another door. Wulfgang nearly takes the second door in the face, but makes it through barely feet behind the girl. Alec, for his part, is not far behind, waving back into their seats anyone who thinks to stand. For some reason, nobody argues with the odd tableau.

Cassandra comes within range of Mister Stentz, who is seated among a small knot of businessmen. They've improvised a table from a large shipping trunk, and it's covered with cards, poker chips, and a few foul-smelling cocktails. Cassandra picks one up. Stentz follows the moving drink to its new owner. His eyes make the barest twitch of recognition before she hurls the contents of the glass into his face. It's a perfect hit; every last drop lands somewhere between his chest and his receding hairline.

For a moment, nobody acts; nobody says anything; even the ladies in the car seem too shocked to even gasp. The only movement is Wulfgang and Alec coming to a sudden halt just short of the scene.

> (OOC) Wulfgang has something here.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Go ahead."

Wulfgang has managed to keep quiet all this time. The moment passes after the drink hits father, Wulfgang sighs heavily. "Very good, Cassandra. Now, it might be best to return to our seat and have the rest of this conversation later, yes?" He smiles, careful not to try and touch her again, just gesturing back. "Good hit though. Wish I could do that." He says, under his breath. Hopefully only ALec and Cassandra will hear, but that seems unlikely.

Cassandra looks at Wulfgang, just once, then back at his father. She sets the glass down roughly. "If I were a man," she states flatly, "I would demand satisfaction." She stalks back up the car, suddenly quiet; probably because Wulfgang asked, but possibly because she's about to start crying and refuses to do it in front of witnesses.

Mister Stentz is still shocked, sponging off the remains of his gin and tonic with a small towel. He looks at Cassandra's retreating back; once, at Wulfgang; once more, at Alec; then gets up from his seat and moves towards a washroom at the rear of the train, in the opposite direction from Cassandra.

Wulfgang turns to Alec. "That went as well as I think anyone could expect. Don't you agree?"

It's an uncomfortable moment. A lot of the other passengers are going back to what they were doing, trying to pretend nothing happened. One of Stentz's companions comments about inventing ettiquette for the steam age; nobody else laughs, so he just pours himself another drink.

Alec shrugs. "Come on," he says, following his sister once again.

> (OOC) Wulfgang follows.

> (OOC) Alec gonna find her

> (OOC) TysGM says, "We'll leave that for next time. I've got one more pose, though."

As Alec and Wulfgang head up the train car, they pass only two people that make eye contact. Wulfgang's mother, who just gives a knowing look, before heading back to find her husband. The other is Isaiah Fields. He has his notepad open and pencil ready. Then he catches the look in Alec's eye, and quickly puts it away again. He shakes his head once, and the message is clear: whatever just happened, for once, it's off the record.
