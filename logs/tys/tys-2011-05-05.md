> (OOC) TysGM says, "Now... did anyone have anything they want to attempt at Fowler's place, given the way we left things last time?"

> (OOC) Alec is gonna keep a close eye on Cassandra. things aren't quite yet resolved, though we did pawn Sonja off on Gerald.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Gerald?"

> (OOC) TysGM sees Vulfgang is still asleep.

> (OOC) Gerald is here after a fashion.

> (OOC) Alec says, "I wanna see what Sonja makes of this, actually"

> (OOC) Wulfgang has connected.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Well. Given what we have, we can either game out your coversation with her, or gloss over. I'm willing to paint in broad strokes if you tell me a few things:"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "a) Your general demeanor b) Anything you intend to get out of the conversation c) The result of a roll on a social skill of your choosing, or adequate default... OR alternatively a roll on the scientific skill of your choice."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "The general demeanor is going to be shy nervousness, which I'll probably try to work through by immersing myself in the SCIENCE she's doing."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Mostly, I hope to impress her 'somehow'."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Ahyes. Science."

> (OOC) TysGM hmm

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Well. Give me a roll against Mathematics, then. Your base skill is 12."

> (OOC) Gerald rolls 3d6 for 14 (6 3 5) vs. 12, failing by 2

> (OOC) TysGM says, "That's the closest you have to Astronomy... hmm."

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "http://xkcd.com/55/"

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Honestly, I think it's entirely appropriate for Gerald to go all tongue-tied and get some math thing wrong. Shyness, you know."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "The question is how well you succeed."

> (OOC) Gerald rolls 3d6 for 3 (1 1 1) vs. 14, succeeding by 11

> (OOC) Gerald says, "holy crap."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Oh hai I upgraded ur telescope"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Well well well. This will be an interesting conversation."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "And very apropos. Mind if I pose some stuff?"

> (OOC) Gerald says, "By all means."

Gerald has been left with Miss Sonja Appleton, an intimidating young lady. Intimidating, more by accident than design: firstly, she's a good five years older than he is. Secondly, she's a lady - something more mysterious to Gerald than the ancient crystal machines or the stars in the sky. Finally, she's a brilliant mathemetician and astronomer. Her workbench is covered in notes and notebooks written a clear and elegant hand, but they're still indecipherably dense. It's quite likely that she's the only person in the world who can read them.

But this is mostly a consequence of appearances that Gerald is prone to misinterpreting. Sonja isn't trying to intimidate anyone. She's simply obsessed with a field that she's largely invented, and comes off as quite absent-minded in many other ways - perhaps even careless. Her clothing is immaculate, but appears to be several years out of date. Her hair is, charitably described, a mess; early in the conversation she attributes its ruin to "tropical sun and sea". Her central notebook - the collected theses on planetary dynamics - is carefully organized and indexed. But the rest of the table is a blizzard of indecipherable notes on every type of paper imaginable, from grocery bags to shipping manifests.

Sonja tries to explain it to Gerald. "It starts with a question of latitude, really," she says. "From our position here in the northern hemisphere, we can only see about half of the sky - if you're patient and can wait a year for the world to turn. But there's these objects here" - she points to a random sketch - "which have extemely long orbital periods. But look, here, in the sixth decimal place..." and from there it degenerates into a discussion of error measurements, statistics, and differential calculus. Gerald rapidly loses track.

Finally, she reaches a crescendo. "So, obviously, I needed to go to sea." She doesn't seem to notice that Gerald lost track three full minutes ago. For his part, Gerald only notices that when Sonja warms to her subject, she begins to **breathe** and **pace** in the most fascinating way. It takes him a few moments more to realize that she's said 'go to sea' and not 'go to see'.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Invited to comment here, Mike."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Or not. But give me a sign if you're still awake. o-o"

Gerald has been engaged mostly in conversational filler for the past... how long has it been? he wonders. He finds himself stammering as he realizes his misunderstanding, then finally manages to correct himself. "Y-you've been to sea? What was it like?"

Gerald realizes, belatedly, that there was a question in her voice, a kind of hope that he recognizes: it's the same hope he was when he tries to explain his new Aetheric Theory to... well, anyone, really. The hope that something he says, anything, will make sense to another human being.

> (OOC) Gerald says, "am I to continue?"

If Sonja is disappointed, she doesn't show it. She shrugs. "A little monotonous, really. I went as a guest, rather than a commissionaire, so the crew refused to allow me near anything to do with the ship. It's just as well. I'm quite clumsy when it comes to sheets and ropes and things... but it made me feel, I don't know, incompetent. Like a pet, or a peasant." Then she grins. "But there were some excellent times, past the equator, in the evenings, when the ship was becalmed or anchor?" The grin widens to a smile. "Oh, the seeing was **perfect!**" She pulls out another notebook - no, a sketchbook - and flips to a page near the middle.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "In a few minutes. c\_c"

"That same comet - 306b - I got all the plots I needed to prove the irregularity in its orbital period! There must be planets, planets yet to be seen through any telescope, so far from our sun that... that... the very air we breathe would be a liquid in the shade! Can you even imagine? And look at this!" She flips to another page. It's a pair of immaculate sketches of a globe - though not the globe beneath Gerald's feet. "The next planet out from ours, the one they call Griffin... it has _icecaps_! That wax and wane with the seasons!"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Go ahead if you like."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Or not. ^\_^ But ping me either way."

"Wait, wait... liquid air? How is that..." Gerald begins, incredulously. Then his eyes unfocus for a moment, and he stares into space. The voice he hears when he contemplates the stones is whispering to him now through the air around him, and for a brief moment, he can _see_ the way the ... uh, the little bits (he really needs a word for them) would begin to cling together as they slowed down. "Yes... yes I _see_. Wow, I never thought of it that way..."

> (OOC) Gerald figures we needed a little sorcerous interlude.

Sonja smiles; she sees that Gerald understands. Maybe that impresses her? He's not sure. "Not many people do. I suppose there's no reason why they should. Theory and practice are like wheat and chaff... still... the mechanicians have provided some fascinating instruments..." she pauses here and looks warily at Gerald. "Uncle said that the last time the Steam Heros were here, they did something to his telescope." There seems to be a question that she's unable to speak; Gerald guesses it might be _Did you clods break it?_ But the hope is back... she might find the truth of it... more impressive.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Your entire future hinges on how well you handle this next item. And it's been pointed out to me that it's Sonja, not Cassandra."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Sorry. There was only one lady in the cast for years."

> (OOC) Gerald will do his best.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Note that you've already rolled a Divine Intervention for Mechanics (clockwork)."

"Well," says Gerald. "It's like this. You can get at least twice the magnifying power with the lenses you've got. It's just they made me put everything back the way it was, because Lord Fowler couldn't figure out how to make it - oh wait! I think I know what I did wrong! I think I can save at least three different control knobs if I could remount that gear off-center so that it'd dial the three lenses in sync! Uh, can I borrow that notepad for a moment? I don't want to mess with the actual 'scope again until I've got it exactly right..."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Good. You can go on to make the actual mods, if you like. More coming?"

In his increasing excitement, Gerald reaches for the sketchbook and pencil - hopefully Sonja does not try to hold onto them, or think it rude if he snatches them away - and quickly fills one of the leaves with diagrams and calculations - calculus comes into play a few times, although with subtly different formulae than are used for astronomical bodies. "There! Yes, I think that'll work. If I remember the parts correctly. May I?" He pulls out his multifunctional screwdriver, and without waiting to see if Sonja gives permission, unfastens the casing of the telescope.

> (OOC) Gerald says, "more"

> (OOC) Alec says, "j-j-j-jam it in!"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Excellent. o\_o"

Sonja begins to object, then quiets again. Gerald is not charging in ham-handed, like one of the amateur mechanics trained to work on the simple locomotives. Rather, he operates with the delicate precision of a jeweler... no, more than that. He isn't dismantling the telescope... he's _treating_ it, giving each tiny screw, each miniature brass shaft, the care that one might give to doctoring a beloved pet. As he works, he mumbles softly, talking to the telescope, explaining tenderly how every step of the way would make it work better.

> (OOC) Gerald says, "one more"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Hey, you're on a roll. Go ahead."

There are tales of 'horse whisperers', men who seem to know the secret language of horses, who can tame the most recalcitrant stallion with a few quiet words. Gerald is a machinery whisperer, a telescope whisperer... it's almost as if his _words_, as much as his carefully planned redesigns, are encouraging the telescope to do its job better. And though Sonja is primarily an end user of a telescope rather than a designer, her own mathematical background helps her see the elegant logic behind the subtly redesigned controls - this time simple enough even for Lord Fowler to understand, but with enough versatility to let someone like Sonja use the device to its full potential.

> (OOC) Gerald says, "I am satisfied."

Gerald eventually finishes and steps back, beaming with an easy confidence as he wipes his hands and folds them behind his back. The sun has reached its zenith; the lawn-party has been going on for some time. Neither Gerald nor Sonja seems to care. The young lady glances between Gerald and the telescope with a look of pure awe, for both the instrument and the young man. She steps forward and slowly puts a finger on one of the new controls; the whole mechanism swings easily and effortlessly away from the sun and towards the eastern horizon. The bearings don't even squeak. She leans forward and puts her eye to the monocular - Gerald notices that the eyepiece has been remoulded, and it takes a moment to sink in that he did himself and barely noticed.

A few minutes pass as Sonja silently swings the telescope to various points on the terrestrial horizon. The sun's too bright to see any celestial bodies, but she's got a few sketches of local geography... perhaps she was 'tuning up.' In any case, Gerald waits patiently, knowing in his bones that every single one of them will be crystal clear.

Finally the girl steps back. Gerald is still two paces away; she looks him up and down, head to toe, twice. "They... they tell stories about men like you," she says softly. "But they're always monstrous. Madmen throwing fire and lightning. How..." Sonja sinks into a chair. She's doing that 'breathing' thing again. "Why are you here? What are you 'Steam Heroes' meant to do?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "You can respond however you like, only, Gerald is feeling his oats right now, so he probably won't say anything 'underconfident'."

"Whatever the situation calls for," says Gerald. "We solve the problems that baffle ordinary people, or that they don't even know exist. We go places that most people don't bother to go, and find the knowledge that they've missed." He smiles. "I'd love to take an ocean voyage myself someday. Who knows what I might be able to see there... or hear."

> (OOC) Alec says, "we are the Laundry. o\_o"

> (OOC) Alec says, "'that guy is a financier and machine empath.' 'the guy next to him?' 'techno-sorcerer.' 'and the taller guy in the stetson?' 'his special power is that he shoots stuff.'"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "You really don't want to annoy the nice man with all the guns."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "sorry for delay. guild dragged me into this pvp thing"

Sonja regains her feet and crosses to the dome's apeture. She looks out at the lawn party below. Her eyes find where Wulfgang and Cassandra are making the rounds, arm in arm, free and easy as the Mayor and his Lady Wife. "Yes. You and your friends. Even the bandit girl. There are tales that were told..."

Sonja crosses the room and retrieves a carpet bag. She begins to remove its contents: books of every shape and size... leather tomes, cheap notebooks, even papyrus scroll cases. "Uncle said the Steam Heroes were full of fascinating young men. I want to hear it all. Especially what that tall fellow meant about the true origin of man. Comets be damned; I'm not missing this."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "I think that shall be the close, OK?"
