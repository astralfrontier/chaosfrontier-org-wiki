> (OOC) TysGM says, "Well let's start with this: How far do you think Gerlad should have progressed with his aetheric studies by now, given the time and points invested; and how might you explain them to Sonja, who is exhibiting some belief that you're a mythic hero of some kind?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Any IC comments you make, you can consider to have happened earlier or later than the last log, where Sonja mentions her book about western legends."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "I'm a bit behind on XP expenditure, but in general I figure I've got a fairly solid handle on the Knowledge spells."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Alright. So Gerald will know this much:"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "There's two parts to Knowledge (and possibly all 'aetherics'). The first part is tied to the crystals. They were tools used to shape the planet and they're all over the world. So Gerald seems to have the gift to telepathically contact them and rummage in them like an old computer."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "That is actually the lesser part of the thing. There seems to be something larger that the crystals themselves used to be connected to, in the same way that Gerald now connects to the crystals."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "..."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "That is the greater part. And Gerald suspects that it's what usually drives the sorcerors of legend insane."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "It looks like we've got no other players, so if you've got anything you can do with that, go ahead. If not, we'll log out in a bit and try again when we're all less nobbled."

> (OOC) Gerald hmm.

> (OOC) Gerald thinks about this for a bit. afk

> (OOC) TysGM kk

> (OOC) Gerald says, "My main challenge is, I don't know where I would start."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Alright. Let's leave it for another time, then."
