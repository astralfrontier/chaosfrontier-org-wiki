It is evening at the Fowler Estate. Dinner is served on the lawn; Fowler's dining room isn't big enough for all his guests this time. By accident or by design, the Steam Heroes are seated at different tables, with guests that reprsent a cross-section of the city's elites: bankers, Fleet officers, Lords and their Ladies. It's just as interesting to see who _isn't_ here - there's a few Guildmasters (particularly from the boatmen and mining guilds), who, along with the Steam Heroes themselves, are the closest representation that the working class of the city has at the event. Fredric and Sonja are the only full-time academics; Alec and Cassandra, the closest things to Army officer. Although 36 is mentioned both by name and by epithets ('The Brass Monk' is most common), there isn't a Shaman in sight.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "If you have any specific goals while mingling, go ahead and state them; otherwise, moving on."

Isiah Fields is, of course, scribbling constantly in his notebook. While the society pages aren't his usual stock-in-trade, he's doing his best to make the most of the event.

> (OOC) Alec doesn't have anything here - mingling is his weak point

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Really, the only mingler among the PCs is Wulfgang."

> (OOC) Alec will talk about colonization to anyone still interested, but yeah

> (OOC) TysGM puts that in, then

> (OOC) Alec also wants to see who got their minds blown with the mention of rails from the stars

There's a lot of gossip to be heard, but there's also a lot of talk about the event that occasionned the party: the railroad. All of these people have something to do with the venture by Fowler and Stentz, and so all of them have reason to listen when the subject is brought up. Wulfgang and Alec take advantage of their attention to push the colonization plan and popularize the idea of the 'rail fleet'.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Mike, you get veto power over this next pose."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Okay."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "It /does/ occur to me that, if there are any heat sources in reach (candles, lanterns, etc.), Gerald might be observing how hot air rises and thinking about the implications."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "while everyone around him wonders when he's going to burn himself or set something on fire. c.c"

The interval between the end of the main course and the serving of cake and coffee is usually an opportunity to change seats so the polite guest has a chance to find more interesting company, or another audience. Several of the more fanciful guests gravitate towards the end of the table where Sonja and Gerald are having an impromptu colloquiam. True to form, Gerald has commandeered the native materials - tea lights, wine glasses, silk napkins, and the like - and set about explaining a theory of lighter-than-air flight. This results in more than a few burned napkins.

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Awesome."

Fowler's Wife is in Gerald's audience, and as lady of the house, it's within her power to absolve him of such minor breaches of etiquette (since it is, after all, For Science), but keeps casting inquiring looks at Sonja. It occurs vaguely to Gerald that Sonja must be Lady Fowler's neice, somewhere between attempts to aerosolize candle parrafin, and deflecting a few inquiries about 'star rails' off towards Alec. "We came here from out there," he mumbles at one confused banker. "It's all in the crystals. Just go have a look."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "The notion doesn't really seem to blow anyone's mind. Not yet, anyway. It's just too fanciful. On the scale of 'memetic permittivity of space travel' ranging from Kepler's Somnium to Gagarin, you're still a few decades short of a John Carter."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Do you want to do more with that? I'm unclear on what you want to do, save find out how well people 'get' the idea."

> (OOC) Alec says, "star rails? most people in the room won't. Sonja and Fields might grasp the implications if they buy the life-here-began-out-there story to begin with"

> (OOC) Alec says, "I imagine it comes down to how many people believe THAT theory to begin with"

> (OOC) Gerald says, "I don't know how advanced layman's cosmology is on this world, but yeah, even the idea that the stars are a place people can go to... well, I wouldn't be surprised if people think Gerald's trying to start a religion."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "And Gerald, for his part, would tend to be aware that the idea isn't ready for prime time, and only even talks about it at all because he doesn't know when to shut up."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Religion in many parts of the world is ancestor-based, even in this more-or-less western culture. A lot of people don't 'get it' because they've never heard of anyone claiming a 'space ancestor'."

> (OOC) Alec says, "to be clear, I the player am more interested in what people think than Alec is :) Alec's goal is the colonization effort"

> (OOC) TysGM hmmm

> (OOC) TysGM hmmm hmmm

> (OOC) Alec hears odd sound, thinks GM has gone 5000 miles without a tuneup

> (OOC) TysGM says, "They just don't seem to be that interested. Odd, because you can get them to listen about the railroad, founding new towns, etc. Maybe they're just thinking about the fortunes to be made at hand."

> (OOC) Alec says, "seems like a compelling thing to think about. good enough"

The evening winds down and eventually the guests adjourn to bedrooms and outbuildings. Gerald hasn't managed to make a napkin float yet, but has some ideas to try when he can get his hands on a steam-loom. With the sun long since down in the west, a calm settles over the Fowler manor.

> (OOC) Alec is taken in the night by the Ascended Masters for talking of the sky-rails, and is never heard from again

Fields is billeted with the Steam Heroes for the evening; Sonja, of course, has a room of her own. Prompted by Wulfgang's mother, Lady Fowler offers to put Cassandra in Sonja's adjoining room, away from such unseemly proximity to young men in a half-finished attic. Cassandra declines, stating that she will not leave her comrades-in-arms, and then more quietly states that Alec is an adequate chaperone.

Wulfgang's father was uncharacteristically quiet at dinner, and retired shortly after dessert. The last anyone sees of Wulfgang's mother, she's heading towards their guestroom with an annoyed look on her face.

And so the day ends.

---

Later that night, there's a clatter of horses coming up the lane, followed by a thumping at the front door, several floors below, and on the other side of the building. Only Fredric hears it; something prompts him to wake Alec. The young soldier awakens with Fredric's hand on his shoulder; the professor is holding a finger of the other hand to his lips - 'shush'.

> (OOC) Alec is gonna slooowly go for his gun.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "You'll have time to prepare."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Want to wake up anyone else?"

> (OOC) Alec says, "Cass and Gerald; Wulfgang, if he's rousable in our current context."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "He is."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Very much so, in fact. Seems that he'd just dozed off."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "If I've been asleep more than an hour, you'll need a crowbar."

> (OOC) Alec says, "good enough. Next thing is to get my rifle, try to get to the roof from inside if possible. if not, I'll hang loose."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "That's surprisingly easy. This is the attic and one of the windows opens out onto the roof, which is more or less navigable shingles."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "What do you do once you're there?"

> (OOC) Alec says, "okay. Belly-crawlin' and takin' up a sniping position"

> (OOC) Alec says, "I want to see who's here and for what"

> (OOC) Gerald , whether roused from deep sleep or not, will follow orders. Are there any spare rifles around?

> (OOC) TysGM poses

> (OOC) TysGM says, "If your usual equipment includes a rifle, you will have it."

> (OOC) Alec says, "if not, you can borrow the Colt .38 I've got as a spare"

> (OOC) Alec declared having a roll of weapons sometime back, so we probably do have spares

> (OOC) TysGM says, "And you make sure to bring it on every trip, I know. So I'm assuming that you've got the guns you normally have, if for no other reason than it will give Alec something to polish if he suspects Wulfgang might be looking down Cassandra's shirt."

> (OOC) Alec says, "damn right. o\_o so what's the situation?"

Alec and Frederic decide to wake the others, excluding Fields. The reporter is on his side, under a thick blanket, and snoring slightly; one can only presume that his usual accomodations are not quite so luxurious.

One of the windows leads out onto the roof; Alec scrambles quietly out and makes his way to the front of the house. In the courtyard below, he can see two horses and two dismounted horsemen. One is leading the horses to a hitching rack; the other is standing near the front door. The two men are dressed in working clothes that appear well-used but not cheap. They don't move like soldiers, and with only two, they can hardly be considered an assault. Still, as Alec watches, one of them pounds insistenly on the front door, loud enough that Alec can hear it.

> (OOC) Alec says, "alright. I'll keep my head down, keep reflective surfaces out of sight, and watch this play out."

The front door opens after a minute or two; one of the household staff must have been up. Alec can hear the tone of their conversation, if not the words; the butler, or whoever it is, sounds more than a little angry. The other man says something, quickly. The butler pauses a moment, then closes the door on him. The man doesn't turn away, rather, he fidgets like someone waiting in line.

Inside the attic, the remaining steam heroes can hear someone approaching up the stairs, and a moment later, a knock on the door. "Professor Fredric?" he asks, quietly but insistently. "I'm sorry, sir, but there's a man here looking for Stentz, or the Steam Heroes. He says it's urgent."

> (OOC) Alec will hop down. false alarm. o\_o;

> (OOC) TysGM says, "This isn't really a risk of a shooting match, unless you overreact. But Alec might want to retain his perch anyway."

> (OOC) Alec says, "if I can hear, then good enough"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Farbeit from me to tell you NOT to be trigger happy."

> (OOC) Alec says, "basically the others can talk or haggle with friendly people who show up in the night. I'm here for the unfriendly visitors"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "And yeah, you do hear it. Leastways, you hear someone coming into the attic and you DON'T hear gunshots."

> (OOC) Alec says, "k, hangin loose while this new development happens"

> (OOC) Gerald says, "So I think I'll go with Wulfgang to visit with the strangers, relying on Alec to keep me covered if it goes pear-shaped."

Fredric admits the butler, who repeats his message. "He says he's from the railway, and he needs to speak to either Stentz or the Steam Heroes. He won't tell me why. I thought I would wake you first; shall I wake the elder Stentz he asks?" The butler startles, nearly falling backwards as Alec hops back through the window, rifle held low to keep his center of mass in check.

"Thought maybe it was disgrunted folk," Alec explains, covering his mouth to stifle a yawn. "We can handle this."

"The railway?" Gerald repeats. Luckily, he hadn't had time to fall properly asleep, and now he's wide awake. If the the Stentz and Fowler clans are the financial parents of the railway, the technology is Gerald's baby, and a serious railway emergency has his full attention. "I'll be right down."

The butler seems relieved. "Very good, sir." He leads everyone down to the front hall, and re-opens the door... careful to stand behind it as it opens. The horseman is still out there; he seems relieved when the butler waves him inside.

"I know you're the Steam Heroes," he says. "My name is Mugge, I'm a foreman... a foreman for the railmen. We've got a camp a few miles up the coast road from yer lane, where the crews sleep while we're laying track. We, uh... well, we found someone." He points out towards the horses. "And we need to know what to do with him."

Mugge gives the butler a look, like he wishes the guy would go away. The butler seems perturbed to have this roustabout in his foyer; Mugge is clean-shaven and not exactly unkempt, but it's hard to keep the dust off while building the railroad.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Any comment so far?"

> (OOC) Alec got nothin?

Gerald scratches his head. "Not sure what the problem is. Is there something wrong with him?" It's rather a leading question - there _must_ be something unusual about this person, or else they wouldn't be going to the Steam Heroes.

"It would be easier to show you," Mugge replies. He leads anyone outside who will follow, and seems to get his wish when the butler stays inside the foyer. The other man has finished untying a large canvas bundle from his horse, and has carefully laid it on the ground.

Mugge pulls back the canvas as his fellow lights a lantern. The sputtering light reveals an unpleasant sight: the body of a young man, wearing only a soggy pair of short pants. The body's hair is matted against its head, and his lips are clearly an unhealthy blue even in lantern-light. He looks unpleasantly bloated, and smells strongly of salt water. It's plain that he's dead.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Aaand that's as far as I'm ready to go."

> (OOC) Alec says, "ok"

> (OOC) Gerald says, "All right. Next time: does it look like anyone we know? Where did you find him?"

Gerald's own face goes pale in the lantern light. "I know him," he whispers. "He goes - er, he went to the University."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Alec, unless you have a reaction, that's our closer."

> (OOC) Alec says, "negatory"
