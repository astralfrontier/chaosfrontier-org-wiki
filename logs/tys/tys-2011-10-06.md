# University of Tys 2011-10-06

> (OOC) Log "Tys-2011-10-06" started by TysGM at Thu Oct 6 22:04:13 2011 CDT (OOC)

It's that time of night when it's too early to be tomorrow and too early to be yesterday. The peace at the Fowler Estate has been disturbed by the arrival of a pair of railway guards, bearing bad news... and a corpse. The deceased is known to the Steam Heroes: a fellow student, someone who would have graduated soon. Even in the dim starlight it's plain to see he's had a rough time: the body is dripping wet and deathly pale, with thin blond hair matted to his head.

> (OOC) Gerald says, "So who's here with us? I remember me and Alec; any of the adults?"

Mugge, the railway foreman who brought the lad here, stands nearby, hat in his hands. "Looks like he drowned," he says, sounding reluctant to state the obvious. "We found him by a stream near the school's camp, half a mile down the road, maybe an hour ago. That stream is the eastern border if His Lordship's property, so... here we are."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Gerald, you've got Mugge, Mugge's unnamed lackey, Fowler's butler, and yourselves. Including any NPC steam heroes you want present."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Which could be: Frederic; Isiah Fields (the journalist); Cassandra; Sonja. Cassandra and Sonja are less likely to be here as bringing ladies to see a corpse at 3am is considered rude."

Gerald is fairly pale himself - for all the danger he's seen on the Steam Expedition, this is his first experience with a real live corpse. Or, not so live, he reminds himself. "I... um... we'd better bring him inside, I guess." He glances at the butler, still stammering uncertainly. "Um, I think we need to wake Lord Fowler. What do you think? Or can it keep till morning?"

The butler smiles politely and does a small bow. Even with a dead boy present he's maintained his composure - and slightly contemptuous air. "I shall inquire with His Lordship, young sir." The butler heads back into the house.

As the butler goes, Mugge puts his hat back on his head. "Well. Seems that's that, then. We'll just be off, I suppose."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Any statements of intent yet?"

> (OOC) Alec has nothin yet. I can't shoot or stab a corpse back to life

> (OOC) TysGM oops

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Actually"

> (OOC) TysGM aborts Mugge's departure

"Hang on a moment," Gerald says, rubbing his chin. He looks out into the night, looking troubled. "Um... could you show me where you found the body?" he asks. It could be a perfectly ordinary accident, and he'll be able to sleep a lot better if he could convince himself that's what it was.

Mugge sighs resignedly. "Yes," he says. "Kinda figured you'd want to see that."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Do you wait for fowler?"

---

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Yeah, I'll wait, assuming he shows. Better to have an adult present to verify that kids aren't mucking up the scene of the... event."

Mugge leads Gerald, Fowler, and Frederic down Fowler's front lane and back to the main road. From there, it's about ten minutes of walking east along the coast road, back towards the city, before reaching the stream that marks the eastern border of Fowler's land. Here, the road crosses an old footbridge, just wide enough for a horsedrawn cart. The rail parallels the road, maybe a hundred feet to the north, where a railway trestle has been constructed - so new that the scent of pine and creosote is still in the air. Mugge crosses on the footbridge and leads everyone upstream on the eastern bank. When he stops, it's about four hundred feet north of the footbridge, three hundred feet north of the railway bridge, and some thirty feet east of the stream itself. "'Twas here," he says. And indeed it was; there's a disturbance in the leaves where it looks like someone fell and lay prone.

> (OOC) Alec rolls 3d for 5 (2 2 1) vs. 14, succeeding by 9

Alec borrows a light source and begins studying the ground around the site.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "ZBoth of you OK with the geometry of this situation? Or do I need to make an actual map?"

> (OOC) Gerald says, "I'm fine with this. Thirty feet's a long way for someone to walk to finish downing."

> (OOC) TysGM poses results of ALec's tracking skill

> (OOC) Alec says, "checking the body, do I see any wounds on the leg? First Aid at 11- as well, it's not Diagnosis but it'll have to do"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Well, the body is back at Fowler's place. c\_c But if you did that before coming here, you'll pretty quickly find that he's got a gunshot wound to his left leg. Pretty nasty one too, looks like it grazed the femoral artery. Looks like it bled out and didn't clot."

> (OOC) Alec says, "yeah, you know what I meant. alright."

Alec straightens up after a few moments. "Reckon he was shot in the left leg. 'Bout here." He taps his own leg in illustration. "He was goin' for the water. Let's see from where.." The young man's eyes resume their search of the ground, walking backwards in time as recorded by the soil.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "No abrupt start. It looks like he wandered here from somewhere to the east. I've just told Gerald something interesting about that area."

"... From that way. Not sure how far it goes," announces Alec, after a few minutes of exploration and return from the east.

"Well..." Mugge begins. "That'll be back towards the school's camp. Where they've got the students doing sums and surveying and collecting bugs and plants."

"Yeah, there's a University camp out that way. He must've come from that direction," says Gerald, rubbing his chin. "We'd better be careful. If someone's going around shooting students, we daren't assume they won't take a pot-shot at _us_."

Alec claps Gerald on the shoulder. "Start talkin' to them scholars, then. I'll see if I c'n pick up the trail of whoever done the shootin'."

"Let's do that," agrees Gerald. "Besides, we'd better report this to the camp anyway. At this time of night, he may not have been missed yet."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK. So. Separately: Alec will follow the trail; Gerald will go into the camp. Gerald, tell me your general approach - accosting people and asking questions?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "We'll cover Gerald first."

---

It's easy enough to find the University's camp. By the time Gerald arrives, accompanied by Mugge and Frederic, it's just after 4am. There are a few people up this early - a small contingent of students and university staff are working in the mess tent, on breakfast, by the smell of it. Mugge excuses himself to speak a University porter, and another man who looks like he's a railway guard. Apart from that, the most common sound is snoring - most of the students and tutors are still asleep in their tents.

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Do we have a name for the victim?"

Frederic wakes a tutor and rapidly establishes that the missing boy was one Dane Clay. He was sixteen years old and was studying surveying and engineering - the old sort, which mostly had to do with buildings, roads, and and fortifications.

> (OOC) TysGM fixes the grammar

"He's been missing since yesterday morning," the tutor says. "Or... mostly missing. Some of the students claim to have seen him last evening, but he wasn't there when a tutor came to check."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Gerald has no particular investigation or interrogation skills. It'll all be more or less collecting information and relying on default."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "At least until he has some more specific things to work with."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Alright. Roll me an IQ roll, straight up. I'll tell you what you find."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "I /am/ going to ask if there are any guns around, and if anyone's likely to have heard one last night."

> (OOC) Gerald rolls 3d6 for 10 (3 5 2) vs. 12, succeeding by 2

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK."

Gerald asks around. It takes a few hours, because at first he has to wake up students to get any answers. This makes his subjects a little... uncooperative. But he does piece together some odd events of the previous two days:

First, Dane Clay missed an oral exam the previous morning, in a civil engineering study group. The exam was a major fraction of a course grade, and it's quite possible that he could have failed by missing it.

Second, his bed wasn't slept it last night - or the night before. His last roll-calls was two nights ago, at dinner. University porters didn't find him in a search of the surrounding area, and had been discussion a larger search if he didn't return.

Finally, nobody remembers hearing any gunshots. But during the day, the students are mostly in the field, along and ahead of the railbed, and the construction makes a lot of noise.

> (OOC) TysGM hmm

> (OOC) Gerald thinks about it...

Someone does mention to Gerald that Dane was sweet on a particular girl. He finds the lass in the mess tent, up far earlier than her classmates. She sits desultorily at a camp table, absently sipping at a mug of herbal tea. Gerald can tell it's chamomile blend from the odor - something 36 would often brew up to soothe frayed nerves.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Anything coming?"

For lack of any more immediate leads at the moment, Gerald tries striking up a conversation, in his own awkward way. "H-how are you feeling?" he asks the girl. "You're up early. Without me coming to wake you, even."

"I haven't slept well," the girl says. And she looks it. "I know you. You're Linkletter. The steam fellow." She sniffs, drags he sleeve across her eyes. "Dane's... dead, isn't he? That's why you're here?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Alec, while we're waiting for Gerald..."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Roll me another tracking roll, please. Same target number (14)"

> (OOC) Alec rolls 3d for 9 (1 6 2) vs. 14, succeeding by 5

Gerald nods. "Yeah," he says. "The railway foreman found him a few hours ago. He-" he begins, then remembers he isn't supposed to give away any details. "He's been missing for a while, hasn't he? What was he supposed to be working on, around here?"

The girl looks like she might start crying, but after a few moments, she rebuilds her composure. "The rail-bridge, southwest of here," she says. "The professors made him the apprentice surveyor while they were putting it up. He was supposed to talk about it in his class yesterday," she continues. "But... he left some things until the last minute. At dinner, two nights ago, he said he'd be sneaking out of the camp to do some of his measurements. We didn't see him all day. And then last night..."

Gerald nods, making a mental note to visit the measurement site later. "Go on," he says encouragingly.

Violet shudders, and a few tears do come. She takes a long drink from her mug. Gerald realizes that the tea has some kind of medicine in it, a sedative dissolved in alcohol. A mild dose, to be sure, but it's a powerful antihysteric agent. "Last night... we saw him again. Me and his tentmate, Hans. It was after dinner but before lights-out - not like that matters much, it's been staying bright very late - and he... he walks up..."

Violet takes a deep breath. "He looked like he'd fallen in the river. His clothes were soaked, his hair was a mess, and he was so... pale. He kept repeating answers from the oral exam he'd missed. Length of the bridge. Bearing capacity of an iron rail. Some... ridiculous things about breaking strengths of pine. He stops in front of us and says... this was the only part that made sense... 'The train will sink!' He said that to me and Hans like we were supposed to understand it."

"We got up," she continues, "and we tried to pull him off to the infirmary tent. But..." she pauses. "His skin was cold, and slippery, and I couldn't hold on. He swatted at Hans, and he swatted at me, and just said it again. 'The train will sink!' Then he... he... he sticks his hand in this coffee pot that we'd had on the campfire, and says, 'Sink! Like this!'"

Gerald looks grim - and yet, at the same time, extremely fascinated. What had started out as a more or less normal investigation has suddenly become Steam Hero business after all. Something had definitely come over Dane in his final hours, and it's beyond the science he'd known just a year before.

"But all I could think was, that the coffee was hot enough to scald. He didn't seem to care. He did it again, going on about his damn sinking train. Hans had gone off to get a porter, and I just stood there like a stupid girl." She shudders. "He wandered off into the woods, and I didn't go after him. He'd... he'd liked me. More than I liked him. But..." She sniffs, and the tears are coming for real now. "I knew he'd died already. And I knew that he'd died alone. Maybe if I'd been his girl, it wouldn't have been that way." She downs the mug and chokes back a sob. "May I go now?" It doesn't sound like she really has a choice.

Gerald shakes his head. "Dane must've stumbled into something... well, etheric is the word I'm using for it. I'm going to find out what - but whatever it was, I'm sure you couldn't have helped him. Don't worry. I'm sure you did all you could."

The girl gets up, politely as she can with her tears. She nods and mouths a 'thank you', but doesn't speak as she leaves the tent.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK. Alec."

> (OOC) Alec sup

Alec has spent several hours out in the weeds. The path isn't all that clear; he finds it and loses it several times. Following the path from the stream, alone, is like reading a story in reverse. The boy was limping, favoring his left leg. He was almost able to walk normally when he left the camp, but could barely crawl when he fell near the stream. Though it's barely a thousand feet, he must have wandered for nearly an hour. He stopped and sat, several times, apparently hiding among rocks, leaves, and the gnarled roots of old trees. Either he didn't stay long, or he didn't move very much while he was there.

Not long after Gerald concludes his interview with Violet, Alec finds himself crossing the northwest perimeter of the University's camp. In one way it's like crossing from night into day - the forest at night was dark, almost impeneterable without his borrowed lantern. The camp is more open - a cleared area, probably a caravan halt at other times. Walking into it, is like leaving a piece of himself back in the forest.

> (OOC) Alec says, "no additional tracks, signs of a struggle, etc?"

And then Alec remembers. It was like something had been with him; a sensation he knew well in the months between the night the Herald came, and Cassandra's exorcism. A period when he'd nearly drowned himself. He'd washed up on a riverbank with his mortal hearing dampened - but his ears were still full, always, with the whispers of the world around him. Whispers that followed him while he was alone in the woods, between wild old streams and places where men rule.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Nope."

> (OOC) Alec says, "alright. Find Gerald."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "He's there. Frederic too, if you want him."

Alec hunts down Gerald. "We got a spirit out there," he reports tersely. "No sign of a fight. No signs of gunplay."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "I think we've got time for one more scene. What do you guys want to do?"

Gerald recounts his own conversation with Violet. "Dane must've been possessed. He was going on and on about the train sinking. And I believe him - unless we do something about it." He shakes his head. "Apparently the last thing he said he would do as a normal person was to go take some measurements the night before last. Let's go have a look."

> (OOC) Alec says, "I'm out of immediate clever things to do, so handing this off to Gerald."

> (OOC) Alec says, "k, let's do that"

It's the same railroad trestle that Mugge led everyone past on the way to camp. It looks new; the pine logs and planks are bright yellow-white and unweathered. "We went over this bridge on the way to Fowler's," Fredric remarks. "Look. You can see down there," he points into the distance, to the west. "That's where it stopped to let us off, so we could walk down his lane."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK. You're going to be making vision checks. Alternatively, if you can explain to me how you'll use an engineering skill to inspect the bridge, you can use that instead."

> (OOC) Gerald rolls 3d6 for 9 (5 1 3) vs. 15, succeeding by 6

> (OOC) TysGM poses results

> (OOC) Gerald says, "And after that, unless it opens up a new line of investigation, I have one last trick up my sleeve."

Alec spends a while walking around the bridge, under the bridge, over the bridge. It's not a gigantic edifice; it's constructed about as well as the fort he used to call home. The creek bed here is some sixty feet wide and thirty feet below the road. The creek itself is shallow here but fast-moving, and the marks on the walls of the ravine show that the water level can vary a lot during the season.

Gerald takes a closer look. The bridge is made primarily of pine logs, pins, and planks, banded in places with iron for strength. It's rather rough-hewn, though hardly shoddy. Much like the footbridge further down the stream, it could easily stand for a hundred years with nothing more than the sporadic coat of paint.

Alec scratches his chin. "Cassie talked about a mudslide or somethin', up north where you fellas met those plant folk," he says presently. "Y'think somethin' like that could sweep in along the line?"

But Gerald notices a few things out of place. Some of the joins are made with pins - long dowels inserted to give strength where load-bearing members meet. Some of the pins are splintered. Some are missing. One plank comes away in his hands, and though Gerald isn't familiar with the language of carpentry, he can tell that the beams behind it aren't fitting togther correctly... and for some reason his engineer's mind adds the word 'anymore'.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Last words?"

"Something's wrong," Gerald says, looking at the plank. "The dowels shouldn't be this weak. Let me try something. Where the eyes fail..." he says, and leans close, stroking one of the boards and listening to its voices.

It takes some time. The bridge is nearly new, bare months old. It's a crude construction, by comparison to the crystal city, or even in comparison to the living trees it was made from. But Gerald does eventually make contact.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "What is History supposed to give you?"

> (OOC) Gerald | When cast on any inanimate object (or a 1-yard-radius section of a large object), History lets the caster determine the recent past of that object, users personality, and so on but no names!

> (OOC) Gerald says, "In this case, it'd mostly be a matter of who - or what - might have been messing with it. No names, and I probably couldn't tell the difference between Dane.before and Dane.after, but I'd be able to tell him from something entirely nonhuman."

Nobody's done construction work on the bridge in a few weeks. Four times a weekday, and twice on weekends, a train goes over - not a very large or heavy one. Or so the bridge thinks, insofar as a bridge is given to thinking about anything. But, at night, someone was coming here. Several someones - coarse men, faces hidden, in dark, heavy clothes, with axes, saws, and hammers. Boards were pried away and pinions were splintered. Two nights ago was the final night. They've not been back since.
