_Humanity is dead. Such transitions, historically, take time, but most are not capped by an event so violent, so raw, so misunderstood for decades, and even centuries later as The Fall. Humanity's future was gone. The first question that was to be answered in the decades following was that of Transhumanity's fate. Was this another age? Or was Transhumanity to be humanity's swan song?_ -- Bjorn Friedman. Lectures in History, circa 213 AF

---

The part of Wilhab in the directions leads out from base, as the side where the mining platform is attached has come to be known, pretty far, for the progression of the population, about 30 km out. The area is what people in the Inner System would probably call a slum, but really it's just vibrant with the Transhumanity who remains on Wilhab. Clusters of Transhumanity litter the streets, the loud hum of interaction a buzz above the constant hum of the scooters that zip by, and the Gons that come out this way.

Tonight is Wednesday night, the night of the big Gon fights that happen out here. The mining company disapproves, of course, but there's enough 'mining accidents' to cover the damages. Besides, the days or weeks that your Gon isn't fit for duty is literally that much longer you spend working, so the combatants literally fight with their lives. Fights are mostly for reputation, but the winner of the night manages to find the cushy and slow mining assignments for a week. Besides, the stadium is quite large, and much of the surrounding Transhumanity attend.

As you enter, your Muse informs your of an AR overlay that is required to attend. This is pretty typical with entertainment venues, and the muse, generally, will fore-go informing you about the information exchange, rep checking, code passthrough and other various checks that your muse negotiates with the arena's servers to ensure a safe time, but such things are routine by now. Not foolproof, but what is? After the overlay kicks in, your muse informs you of your table assignment, and the surroundings dim except the illuminated path for you to wall. A cursory glance around shows half tables strewn around in tiered rows. Everyone is shown to the same table.

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Okay, after read text dump, everyon epose at least once saying 'Here I am' and mention what your general appearance is. Eveyone will be on firewall's private netwokr by now, so you can all at least hear Doc, but I think he has something else planned..."

> (OOC) Remus says, "What's a Gon?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "Covered in last time's log. http://pandoraslair.org/logs/untergang-2011-01-08"

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Oh.. They're mechaniod metal crab-like mining drones. ... Prolly read the last times log when you get a chance.. sorry. x.x"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Just did. So do we come here physically in our starting sleeves? Or did we have to egocast here from further out than Saturn?"

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "You came here in your starting sleves. One way or another."

> (OOC) Remus poses

Katja strolls toward the table. She's a blonde haired, green eyed woman of medium height. She's dressed in her standard roaming outfit of boots, brown pants, green shirt, and brown jacket. The jacket has a patch indicating that she is a pilot, as well as one for the Titanian Commonwealth. Kat pulls out a chair and sits back. She seems comfortable in this setting.

Damon glances around the room with a practiced eye for trouble. Clean-shaven, with short brown hair in a buzz-cut, he still looks a lot like the corporate muscle he once was. Indeed, even though he's long since traded the company uniform for a bulky blue coverall, he still looks enough like the Mean Green that he's given a little bit more personal space than usual in a dive like this.

The venue admits all interested parties, but subtle tags accompany virtual people to help distinguish infomorphs and remote viewers. One such avatar, now approaching the table, presents itself as a man, with mixed Chinese and Caucasian features: a certain roughness of the face, a certain elegance to the eyes. He wears hanfu, the traditional northern Chinese clothes, with a zhiduo cut and colored to resemble a lab coat, and glasses which in this day and age can only be an affectation.

Remus Greyrobe finds his way to a small uninhabited table in a corner. He can't see the pit, put the big screen over the bar is pretty clear. He thought he was lucky, to be able to come to WilHab in the flesh - an easy orbital transfer from the Col-Am scum barges currently parked a few million km further out. Maybe even an easy sale, of premium Col-Am sleeves to satisfy the demand from retiring miners. He doesn't feel so lucky now, though. His simple, hooded grey cloak doesn't offer much protection, and his sharp, handsome features stand out among the grimy machines and mongrel population.

> (OOC) Remus says, "Sorry.x \_x"

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "For?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Bad timing."

The AR dims the perception except the ring, as two fighters are introduced. The audible conversation is dimmed, probably another effect of the AR, as each combatant is announced. "In this corner, Fightin' Rex-T!" As his stats, 21-10 appear. "And in this corner, Station Joe!" again, 1-0, known for bringing down last week's contestant in a single blow.

As the action starts below, a voice speaks, identified by your muse as Jackson from f-net, the Firewall network. "Hey guys.. say, did the match start already? Bummer. I'm kind tied up with something right now, so I'll give you the straight this way." A loud metallic crash accompanies a flash of the AR as the Gons in the ring go at it, "So, our sentinals have found some really strange activity at this totally groovy place, man."

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Still posing"

Jackson pauses, "Yeah, man. There's this radical art project a little further near base. They totally have an AR enhanced garden.. you guys should totally check it out." He pauses for a bit. "Anyway, this place runs some majorly hardcore machinery in the back, but lately, they've managed to pick up a bunch of Inner System folks, from industrial grade computational houses. Serious shit, man. We need you guys to go in and figure out what's up. They found something big, and we totally want the 411, you know?"

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Open pose"

> (OOC) Doc on it.

The Chinaman speaks. "What qualifies us to investigate this more than your other sentinels, please?"

"Like, I dunno man." Jackson states, "Really, I'm just passing the word down the pipe."

This seems to satisfy the questioner. "Ah yes. This distributed authority business." Seeming to note his companions for the first time, he nods politely to each in turn. "Doctor Wu Ming. Please call me Doc. We seem to be allies now."

Katja says, "Any security details?"

Katja looks at the Chinaman as if her were an interesting curiousity.

> (OOC) Remus takes his out. Slow fire tonight.

> (OOC) Katja says, "Sorry. I'm quick when I'm actually at my desk. ^^;"

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Eh. Don't take out plz."

> (OOC) Remus puts it back then

> (OOC) Menocal has connected.

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Just viewlog to read the backscroll, then pose in when ready. :) ALso, use "" or :: to OOC, please."

Remus, ever the diplomat, resists rolling his eyes. _Such a tragicaly relaxed attitude._ "Yes. If it's important, have they taken measures to secure it?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "also please 'deleteline 37', log is running :)"

Jackson shrugs, "I knew a guy that did some of their emotional modeling for a while, man, but he said when they threw him out the place went uber tight. You might think it was a corp." He says this last as if spitting on a grave.

Remus nods. "That sounds like a 'yes'. Remus Greyrobe, by the way." He briefly raises a hand, palm-out in greeting.

Menocal perches on a seat-back, listening, head tilted to the right, eyes bright in a grey-skinned face under purple hair. "That sounds like a very interesting thing to look at." She beams, looking at the small group.

Jackson chimes in, "Oh guys, it's the best!" All the while this has been going on, the match has been happening in the background, violent crashes and flashes accompany what is nominally just a pretty good fight. It seems that the 1-0 kid, Station Joe, has been handed his first loss, and the crew are preparing things for the next match.

Katja sighs. She doesn't seem pleased. "So there's no updated info? We'll have to scout it all out."

Damon speaks up for the first time. "Kris Damon here," he says crisply, eyeing his companions - or at least, the physical ones, as his gaze passes across Doc's avatar without stopping - as if sizing them up. "Someone would have to. If it weren't us, it would have been someone else."

"It's a bummer, I know. But, you'll get used to it.", Jackson adds.

Remus shrugs. "I'd ask whether a piece of art can actually be dangerous, but..." he gestures towards the arena. "Behold, the indigenous barn-dance."

Menocal shrugs. "Sneak into the office of a XP company doing really bad things and making their smartwalls show octopus sex, not much harder, I suppose." She pauses. "I am Menocal. Vlatislava. And good art can always be dangerous, or at least interesting."

Katja crosses her arms uncomfortably. "I hope one of you is good at spy ops because I'm not. It's Katja, by the way."

> (OOC) Remus mav'd. o\_o

Jackson adds once last thing, "Oh, and I'll need some sort of status report by tomorrow. No problems for you guys, yeah?"

Katja blinks. "Tomorrow?"

"Yeah yeah. To know where you've gotten." Jackson says.

> (OOC) Damon says, "So what exactly /is/ our target anyway?"

Doc raises a finger and smiles. "Status, not results. Very well, we'll see to it."

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "You can ask that ICly, if you want."

Katja has her muse calculate how quickly she can get off the station once the mission ends.

"So what precisely _is_ our target?" asks Damon. "You need to be a bit clearer when specifying your mission objectives, if you don't mind me saying so." He pauses. "Sir."

Katja's Muse hums for a second, and reports back, "Time, 8 hours. Probability of Success: 23%."

Katja swears in German under her breath.

"Sir? Hey man, I'm just your proxy man.. No need to call me names. You officially have all the info we do, man. Something's up in there, we need to know what. Preferably by acquiring whatever it is." Jackson reports.

> (OOC) Damon says, "We're talking about the art project/AR garden, then?"

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "It's something happening in the same building, yeah."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Sounds more like something is going down in a back room."

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "As part of or with the same project."

"Old habits die hard," Damon says without apologizing. "All right, give me a map reference and I'll get a feel for their meatspace security on the outside. Any of you any good at talking your way into a place?" he asks, looking straight at Menocal.

Doc extends a hand, flourishing four glowing cards. With a gesture, he sends the floating effortlessly in front of his less abstract companions. Each card reads: "Fiddler's Green - immersive infomorph companionship. Program requires read/write access to entoptic augmented reality. Pocket the card to grant permission."

"If you'll be so kind as to keep in touch via my card," offers Doc, "I will also examine their electronic defenses."

Remus examines the card, frowning slightly. "You want to... ride along? That sounds somewhat unhygenic."

"It's cool man. Maybe we can have a smoke later." The location of the front entrance to the project is projected onto your AR, as well as a basic blueprint.

Katja takes the card. "Just don't mess with my HUD, yeah? It's distracting."

Menocal says, "I am pretty good at talking into things. Also pretty good at sneaking into things and stuff." She takes the card, looks at it, and pockets it blythely. "Also good at running, not so good at fighting, just so we are clear."

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "It can easily be noted too that the gardens are free public access, so the front about third of the building is open 24/7 "

> (OOC) Remus misfires

Remus nods. "I'm the most accomplished liar that you will ever meet. That should be worth something. I'll be right behind you." He pockets the card.

Katja studies the map for a few moments before adding some of her own notes. Two rings, one close to the target and one following the entrance to the park. She puts some markers near possible escape routes. "I'll work on extraction. Unless you want to take that?" She looks at Damon.

> (OOC) Remus nominates Menocal as pro tem leader, as she is the most competent-sounding.

Damon slips Doc's virtual card into one of his many coverall pockets. He seems to be focusing on the blueprints. "These blueprints. Public records?" He studies Katja's markers with a practiced eye, and adds a few of his own, indicating suitable nearby cover and fields of fire. "We'll work together on that," he says. "If we're facing a hostile extraction, anyone who _can_ hold a weapon usefully _should_."

Damon's muse notes the hall of records where the blueprints came from and the last time they were updated. 6 months ago.

Katja frowns. "Transport is going to be tough. I need time to work on that." She's still pissed at the odds of leaving anytime soon.

Katja looks up from her notes. She stares blankly at the group for a moment. Pointing at herself, she says, "Pilot and muscle." She points to Damon. "You?"

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 80 for 49 (exceptional success, MoS 31)

Menocal starts to examine the map carefully, looking at things like ventilators, maint shafts, back ways in. "never use front door if back door good, never use back door if garage door good, and chimney best of all.

> (OOC) Remus says, "Dunno what Doc just did, but apparently it worked."

> (OOC) UntergangGM laughs.

Doc stares for a few moments. "Their installed computing capacity exceeds their publically known requirements by at least an order of magnitude," he finally remarks with a grin.

"Just muscle," Damon replies. "But I'm pretty damn good at it. I can fire anything and swing anything, and if I can't, give me a week. Ever had a command, Katja?"

> (OOC) UntergangGM rolls 1d100 vs. 35 for 86 (exceptional failure, MoF 51)

> (OOC) Menocal rolls 1d100 vs. 50 for 3 (exceptional success, MoS 47)

Katja says, "Yes." She looks pointedly at Doc. "What about you? What do you bring to the table?""

Doc holds out his hands. "A command of the sciences, interests in robotics and habitat engineering, and combat software engineering. On the defending side generally."

Menocal smiles. "Oho, not-door, good for in-and-out. Will have to see what can see and how to get there."

Katja has her muse bring up public profiles for everyone at the table, and berates herself for not thinking of it before.

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "So, do we have a plan yet?"

> (OOC) Doc is gonna scope their firewall as announced

> (OOC) UntergangGM must have missed that.

> (OOC) Doc says, "not the public site - I'm gonna worm my way into whatever they have running in the back."

"Well," Greyrobe states simply. "Menocal seems eager to get on with it. Perhaps I should escort the young lady to the place of interest, and see what can be learned. And if she can find a way in, for Doc or herself, so much the better."

Menocal is listed as a retro-coolhunter and fashion designer in her public profile. She also likes to dance, and has been seen arguing with herself.

> (OOC) UntergangGM looks at time and wife. "Actually, I think we'll stop here for today. You guys can come up with how you think you want to approach physically. And we can run it next time. I would normally plan on going for another hour, but work is beating the shit out of me lately.

> (OOC) Damon says, "OK."

> (OOC) Doc says, "we made progress :)"

"I'll come along part way," Damon says. "I need to walk around the building. Blueprints are all well and good, but nothing beats boots on the ground."

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Pose it in!"

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "ANyone else?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "I think that covers it. We've all got places to go. Things to see. People to do."
