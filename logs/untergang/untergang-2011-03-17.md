Day and Night don't mean anything. At least not in this place. Not only is such an idea only a few nibbles and words in the simulation program; but those datum are sent to another subsystem, to be interpreted as experience over the simulated brains of it's inhabitants. At least, those inhabitants who chose to have such a simulation affect them. In this current time. At this place. In actuality, the computer is simulating dozens of locales, to make interaction of those slave to such cycles seem more natural.

But on the security bench for the infomorph farm, it always feels like night. It's not the most glamorous job, the significant firewalls and automatic active patrols make simple and playful hacking attempts as routine as routing eMail. Not too long ago, the daily, (or hourly. Sometimes the skip a whole 48 hours) of the Humanity Alliance Against Infomorph's lackluster attempts to break in occurred. Steady night, along a lonely highway, the headlights show the way, the indicators all stay nominal, interpreting feedback from the monitors hardly ticks over the simulated neurons for the Infomorph on duty.

But for people who's only existence, who's way of life is digital, it's 'worth' having an expert on the panels at all times. A small price to may. And that's where Doc finds himself, glancing over the indicators on another shift on the security bench.

> (OOC) Damon has connected.

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "And when you're done reading, make an InfoSec roll. It's for system monitoring, so any complimentary skills you think should work, let me know."

> (OOC) Doc says, "basic InfoSec:"

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 80 for 60 (success, MoS 20)

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "'k posing."

Of course, tonight won't be one of those lonely nights where you turn in to the truck stop at daybreak. The system thinks something is wrong. One of the users on the system seems to be performing some, unusual tasks. Some trace notes make it seem like 'Yung Mai' isn't who he says he is.

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "So, it's your turn now to do something. Options are on page 256 / 257."

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "He ended up at 'Spotted' status."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Zero In. opposed InfoSec tests"

> (OOC) UntergangGM rolls 1d100 vs. 65 for 89 (failure, MoF 24)

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 80 for 23 (exceptional success, MoS 57)

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Pose pinning the attacker down in the system, please. "

Doc has always favored a physical approach to existence. Setting down his pai gow dominoes, he pulls one of the glowing displays over to him and starts sorting the electronic wheat from the chaff. After a few moments, he has it: another user on the system provided only a mesh ID, but subscribed to file updates being made by Yung Mai and added a stored trigger to the subscription which took advantage of a weakness in the system to run under that user's permissions. Records indicate the subscription's addition; that's the intruder.

A message is added to the subscription, encoded with Doc's public key. The message reads simply: 'Run, Run, fast as you can. You can't catch me I'm the gingerbread man.'

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "He's trying to upgrade status against you. opposed InfoSec"

> (OOC) UntergangGM rolls 1d100 vs. 65 for 66 (critical failure!)

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 80 for 42 (exceptional success, MoS 38)

The hacker, inelegantly tries to hook a cron job in the system, using his current privilege to try and write to a file left open a few days ago to append a new ID to his account. A quick few lines intercept this trick before the hacker can pull it off, however.

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Your turn."

> (OOC) Doc says, "if he's been zeroed in, I have a mesh ID. I have 3 Complex actions (go infomorph), so starting a physical trace on that device/user as first one. Second one is to force users to re-authenticate."

> (OOC) Doc says, "I want to see how long it takes him to try and log back in. The less local he is, the longer it'll take."

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Okay. Thanks for reminding me that you get more speed, I forgot. We'll handle the trace first. You do have the -30 for privace mode, so.. research test. I'll give you a +20 because you can use the system logs to at least help a bit, since his invasion was pretty clumbsy."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Research is 80, so 70"

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 70 for 61 (success, MoS 9)

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Okay. The MeshID he is/was on is traced out of Thoroughgood on Dione around Saturn. You can go ahead and pose the forsed logoff too. AS soon as you finish the trace that MeshID will blink off the net, but you should see it."

Without waiting, Doc starts a bloodhound yapping after the mesh ID the attacker is using - if it's nearby, for example, it could be a physical attack in the offing. Another moment is sufficient for him to slap a hand on the glowing 're-auth all' indicator waiting for him on the security console. Everything around him ripples as his own credentials are renegotiated with the host, but he has the advantage of being extremely local. His attacker does not.

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Let me know if you're going to cycle your third action."

> (OOC) Doc says, "not yet"

> (OOC) Doc says, "the next thing I'm doing is a task action anyway"

> (OOC) UntergangGM rolls 1d100 vs. 65 for 16 (exceptional success, MoS 49)

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Opp InfoSec Test again. (THat was firewall test again) System is in active scan, so you can have +10, and the best he'll come in at is spotted. "

> (OOC) UntergangGM rolls -10 vs. 65 for -10 (-10)

> (OOC) UntergangGM rolls 1d100-10 vs. 65 for 69 (79 -10)

> (OOC) Doc says, "just reduce the 65 to 55"

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Okay."

> (OOC) UntergangGM rolls 1d100 vs. 55 for 53 (success, MoS 2)

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 90 for 39 (exceptional success, MoS 51)

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "posing"

A short while later, a full minute, the system reports another funny intrusion. Again, nothing can be tracked down at this time, but someone else certainly just got in. A quick scan of the MeshIDs reveals that no one of the same MeshID is on the system.

> (OOC) Doc says, "spawning my pre-saved Infosec-oriented delta fork to start a research task (should take one action), and zeroing in."

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "What are you researching? "

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "ANd what's the delta fork's effective skill.. like 60? I forget."

> (OOC) Doc says, "digital activity tracking (p. 252) - other actions taken by this mesh ID. it's a research task, so I'm delegating it ot the fork."

> (OOC) UntergangGM nods.

> (OOC) Doc says, "his research skill will be 40, I'm gonna have him take extra time (3 hours)"

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Okay. Opp InfoSec again."

> (OOC) Doc says, "which should bring the effective skill up to 70. I won't get results now, but it's not something the attacker can conceal on short notice."

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 80 for 2 (exceptional success, MoS 78)

> (OOC) UntergangGM rolls 1d100 vs. 65 for 97 (exceptional failure, MoF 32)

> (OOC) UntergangGM nods.

> (OOC) Doc got pose for this

Drawing a card from his sleeve, Doc throws it nearby the security console. It writhes and grows, taking on the shape of a paper doll vaguely reminiscent of Doc himself in appearance. "Dai Goh," it announces mechanically, and Doc smiles. "Research task. All actions taken by this mesh ID." He pulls a copy of the ID off his security screen and flings it at the delta fork. And while his low-resolution copy starts on its own task, Doc gets back to work drilling down on this new connection.

Another message, delivered to the same subscription as before, and again, encoded with Doc's public key reads: 'Doc, you dance divinely. You are everything they said.' before his id is found again, this time through a pretty pedestrian worm he managed to activate on one of the lower InfoSec members of the combine, his single, on a new MeshID, tagged along this Worm, mostly concentrating on Doc's actions, and sending said note.

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "He's locked down for anything else you want to do to him at this point. I think you have at least one more Complex Action on him at the moment before he gets to act in any real way."

> (OOC) Doc says, "lock him out. opposed infosec, he's at -20 for being locked"

> (OOC) UntergangGM rolls 1d100 vs. 55 for 45 (success, MoS 10)

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "His skill is 75, he's just had Spotted -10 his whole visit, so..."

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 80 for 15 (exceptional success, MoS 65)

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "He managed to evade but is still locked down. Posing."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Really? 'if the defender succeeds, the intruder is shut out'"

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "But it's opp roll. Highest successfull roll wins, right?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "ahyeah, go ahead then"

> (OOC) Doc was thinking of it in GURPS terms, where Regular Contests can be succeeded or failed by each party separately

Suddenly the trace return stops. The system activity all seems normal, no indications of trouble in the system. A few moments later, your Muse informs you of a call coming in from one Solomon Ramses. Public information on his net ID seems to indicate he is a Security Consultant operating around Saturn.

Doc gestures at the 'phone, letting it take the call.

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "You goign to let the machine get it, or you're answering it? Sorry, being dense."

> (OOC) Doc says, "I'll take it."

> (OOC) Doc says, "wow, a second call?"

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "You're a popular guy!"

A blurred image stands before you, a taller black man, in a finely tailored suit. The image is static, as the voice speaks, "Hello Doc. I'm sorry to have to call you with such lag between us, but it's routine in our business." He pauses for a second, probably talking to his muse, "You may not know me, Doc, but I have heard about you. It's useful in my lines of work."

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Any response? He'll keep talking if not."

"I take it you're the gingerbread man," observes Doc wryly. He wonders how much time he'll have to think about this situation while his message reaches Saturn. Even the Long Array can't transmit faster than light.

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Pause a sec"

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Apperantly quite a good amount of time. jeez. :)"

> (OOC) Doc says, "this is why people usually send beta forks for conversation between planets :)"

> (OOC) Doc says, "(and why trying to hack Neptune from anywhere near Jupiter or inward is futile)"

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Clearly :)"

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Well, I screwed that up. Hrm hrm hrm"

> (OOC) Doc says, "nope, you're fine. if you really need an in-game explanation for how to do this, I can provide one"

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Well, the book mentioned FTL communications between Habs."

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "BUt it's utterly failing to give HOW MUCH faster than FTL it is."

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "It says low bandwidth is out of the question, which is fine, but..."

> (OOC) Doc says, "if you mean the quantum-entangled communication, that's on p. 315"

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Well, QF and QE"

> (OOC) Doc says, "k, so it's not slow, just expensive. :) proceed"

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Well, in any case, We'll handwave laster. :D"

The man chuckles, "You could say that I baked the gingerbread man." Solomon adopts a jovial tone behind his unwavering persona. "But let's cut to the chase. Doc. Have you ever wondered about the future?"

The man stops and thinks about this. Whatever this other's motives, the question itself is a fair one. His responsibility to the safety of his habitat's systems has been met; there's no harm in indulging in culture here.

"The master said, 'Encourage the people to work hard by setting an example yourself.' This I take to mean that a ruler will obtain good subjects by good example; right conduct promotes right conduct. The so-called Thrice-Great Hermes echoed this wisdom in the saying 'that which is below corresponds to that which is above'. One should assume that for a good future, we should work to have a good present. If we act properly now, the future will assure itself."

"In the context of collectivist or anarchist movements, of course, the role of 'the ruler' is more troublesome. One should then look to specific individuals in various fields of endeavor for leadership - the 'uncrowned kings' of Mau Lau's mutualist writings. In computer security, I strive to set a good personal example for this reason."

There is a pause, even more of one then one might expect with the connection. Solomon does eventually answer, "I'm glad you feel that way. Doc, I." He pauses, "We, in my organization. We work for the future." He pauses, "Much like the body has antibodies, we seek out illness, in transhumanity, and eliminate it." He pauses again, "And, must like antibodies, they work best if the body doesn't think about them very much. If at all."

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "moar"

"We think, having observed you, that you can be an antibody for transhumanity. To create a future for everyone. A sentinel in this organization." He stops for a time. "There are tests, of course." again, the jovial tone is heard.

Doc smiles that strained smile of a man with bad news for a good friend. "This has been very interesting, but I don't wish to exhaust your valuable supply of qubits - nor ours - in conversation which could be held on such abstract topics in a less real-time venue."

Solomon speaks quickly, "What about your past, Doc?" He sounds urgent, trying to get this out before you cut him off. "Don't you want to know, who you are? What happened?"

Doc pauses, narrowing his eyes. "A maxim in science is that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence," he says. "If a man lacks a useful memory, how shall he believe another's claim to its contents?"

The pauses seems like an eternity. "I know what you were told. We suspect some." He pauses, "Different truths. We can find these truths out for you. Specifically about you. Who you are." He pauses. "'Doc'". Another short pause. "Have you seen the surface of Earth, Doc? It is not a pretty place. I was told I didn't last seven minutes the last time I was there."

"My last memories of Earth are the emergency upload facilities in Beijing," Doc says quietly. "Since then I have followed the topic with some interest, in an academic capacity."

"If such a place exists, or even existed." Solomon pauses for a bit again, "What's allowed to be known is just a surface on what really goes on. Transhumanity is sick. It has diseases it can't sure. We would like to cure them of these diseases, so that the truth doesn't need to be hidden anymore." "But, I cannot tell more. It is yours to believe me or not." Solomon transmits a public key, but not his published public key, as confirmed by your muse, "Help us ensure tomorrow, and I'll give you your past. Your true past."

"We shall see." Doc returns to his normal genial smile. "I am unlikely to do anything I wouldn't normally do, but as an autonomist I won't refuse reasonable requests for aid."

Solomon clears his throat, "We need a specialist on a hab around Saturn called Wilhab to run with a team gathering there. And we can't afford the qubits this time, as you pointed out." "We can arrange for an egocast one week from today. You will officially be entering the system as a refugee looking for work. You have my key for any communication, Doc." And the communication is broken.

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "That can be it for now."

> (OOC) Doc says, "k"
