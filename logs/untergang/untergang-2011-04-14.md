> (OOC) Damon has connected.

Like any machine, the human body begins at its most basic functions and builds from their foundation. Like any physical device, basic requirements are met before more sophisticated elements are possible. So it is that Katja Muller finds herself taking several breaths of stale, chill air before she realizes she can't quite remember how she came to be here.

And what is "here"? A hibernation pod. She is in it. As a passenger, her still-struggling brain volunteers to the audience of her Cartesian theater. No gravity. A spaceship or space habitat.

> (OOC) Doc says, "open pose."

> (OOC) Doc says, "(from Katja)"

Katja before opening her eyes, she listens carefully for any sounds that may help her place her current location. Slowly, she nudges each of her limbs to make sure that she's still in the same sleeve that she has used for years. Sensing no immediate danger, she groggily opens her eyes to take in her surroundings. "Junkers," she askes her Ego, "date and time?"

"Assuming no relativistic effects, you've been in hibernation for about three weeks," the Muse replies mentally. "Crucial data is missing from before that time, and I'm unable to synchronize with a local mesh for time."

Katja groans. "Location?"

"In the larger philosophical sense, 'in trouble'," the Muse answers bemusedly. "The total lack of local mesh traffic suggests a derelict starship. There are no even incidental radio signals I can reach."

Katja frowns. She sits up and takes account of her surrounding.

The chamber in which Katja's hibernation pod resides is currently being lit thanks to bioluminescence - engineered bacteria or fungus, a standard tool aboard some makes of spacegoing craft. The artificial lighting must be out. In the dimness, she can make out seven other pods. A few of them are showing indications of cycling out of the hibernation state - their occupants are being revived.

Katja checks for clothing or nakedness.

Looking down, Katja makes out the familiar outlines of a form-fitting biosuit. It's capable of being converted to a short-term vaccuum suit and is standard spacer wear. Its own computing elements are still offline, though, making it little more than a thin veneer against the biting cold of the air.

> (OOC) Doc says, "Menocal and Damon, you're starting to wake up in a similar fashion. Open pose."

Two of the other pods finish their cycle, opening their respective hatches to permit their occupants egress.

Menocal mutters something in mangled Russian. It may not make sense to anyone, but to her muse, she's asking it what time it is, when the last intoxicant she had was, and if there's records of a sexual encounter. (When she feels this disoriented, one of the latter two tends to be involved, in her experience.)

The last three weeks, having been spent in cold sleep, are dutifully reported back as Extremely Dull.

Damon has his own personal missing-time drill with his muse, but in his case, the first question is whether there's any record of him dying recently. It wouldn't be the first time he's gone down in combat - but even as he's asking, he becomes aware that whatever has happened isn't a conventional resleeving.

Menocal is somewhat disapponted; you'd think feeling this messed up would have had some fun attached.

Everyone is, in fact, in the morphs they remember. But the past few weeks are entirely gone. The memory of Wilhab is there, and a meeting of newly-minted agents of the secretive conspiracy called Firewall, but...

Katja scopes the room for supplies/equipment.

Menocal checks her belt for her gear. Any of it.

As Katja floats freely through the room, she finds emergency resuscitation kits, first aid packs, medipaste and other staples of shipboard life. Some of it might be of use soon, as a few of the pods are indicating temporary resuscitation failure. But there are no weapons or other military/security apparatus.

Similarly, the team's own personal equipment is nowhere to be found. Whatever was implanted seems present and functional, however.

> (OOC) Damon says, "Including Damon's hand laser?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "if you wear or carry it, it's not here. if it's implanted, you have it"

> (OOC) Katja says, "So much for not parting us with our gear right away. n.n"

Damon flexes his wrist. "At least I'm not completely unarmed," he mutters.

> (OOC) Doc says, "you've explored exactly one room :)"

Katja pulls out the good supplies to seperate them from those that are past their freshness date, so to speak. After imposing a bit of order, she heads over to the other pods to check for life.

One of the pods contains a man - Katja has to think through for a moment, finding that her AR supplies a name before her organic memory can. REMUS GREYROBE.

Menocal sighs, as that covert ops tool cost a lot and she didn't get the plans with it. She takes a deep breath, telling her muse to remind her to break the nose of the person that took it, and then starts checking door to see if they're open... and trapped.

There are two doors out of the room - the hibernation pods are arranged four to a wall, facing each other. The automatics aren't working, but the door mechanisms can probably be forced by main strength, and supposedly the manual release will work.

Katja checks for lifesigns on the pod containing Remus.

The pods are all occupied - the other four are strangers as far as anyone here knows. Resuscitation was attempted on all occupants. So far, only Katja, Menocal and Damon have successfully woken up. For now, the pods are inducing sleep again, waiting for the body's natural rhythms to provide another opportunity.

Menocal says, "Thinking something developed upfuckedepicness."

Katja says, "Right. I need to get to a console to assess this hunk of junk." She pushes up her sleeves and pulls up the legs of her biosuit to expose her grip pads. She grabs some medipaste and looks expectantly at the others."

> (OOC) Katja says, "How big are the first aid packs?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "standard first aid packs are about the size of your fist. basically they're an injection system for nanomachines, along with a device large enough to read data from them and mesh with you."

> (OOC) Doc says, "they're designed to adhere to most anything so you can literally slap some on and carry them around with you."

"Let's do that thing, then," says Damon, checking one of the door mechanisms, then gripping the manual release with his left hand, making sure the lens is clear on his hand laser. "Everyone behind the wall. I'll take point."

> (OOC) Menocal says, "are we in gravity?"

Katja swaps the medipaste for a first air kit. She slaps it onto her upper left arm.

> (OOC) Doc says, "you are in freefall"

Menocal hops across the room in freefall, grabbing three medipacks - one in each hand, and one with an oddly shaped foot.

Katja takes cover and adheres to the wall.

> (OOC) Doc says, "Okay. Damon, heading left or right?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "you have no data to suggest either is better at this point"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Left."

> (OOC) Damon says, "Assume I'm proceeding as if hostiles, friendlies, or a hostile environment might be behind any door"

The door opens slowly and fitfully. Even with modern alloys, a pressure door must necessarily withstand a human-breathable atmosphere, which will never become thinner no matter how technology advances. Beyond is a larger room, squarish. The bioluminescence is here too, and in the dim light the group can make out only one other light source. It's a time readout, the one Katja dreaded seeing. LIFE SUPPORT FAILURE EST. 32 HOURS 12 MINUTES.

Beyond that, one would guess that this is a lab or workshop. Any number of engineering tools lay scattered and broken here, their weak magnetic fields or smart matter keeping them from floating freely.

Katja says, "Du Hurensohn."

Damon raises his arm clear of firing position again. "Okay, a little over a day till the end of the world. Anything we can use in here, people?"

Katja releases from the wall and makes her way to the tools.

Katja clears off a workbench, and starts placing anything salvageable on it. "Put anything not broken here."

Menocal says, "Eto piz\`dets."

Menocal puts the three medkits on a table, then goes a-salvagin' as best she can

Everyone's Muse, in his or her own way, begins notifying their owner: "weak radio signals have been detected." The hibernation chamber must have been a Faraday cage. Fortunate that it was: the electronics on most of the devices showing signs of burnout or damage from some sort of energetic discharge. Whatever happened, the coldsleepers were spared from having their implants fried out. And more importantly, their pods survived.

As the three work, a local mesh begins establishing itself from their implants. The life support countdown isn't wireless-capable, but something else nearby is. Just what isn't clear, but maybe after it finishes rebooting and self-cleansing, it will identify itself.

> (OOC) Doc says, "you have enough tools to perform basic Hardware tasks, at no penalty or bonus."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Is there a carry case of some kind?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "Yes. pose accordingly. What's the group's next move?"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "or can we improvise one?"

Katja says, "Alright. This should help. Now I just need to fix life support, find out where we are, do engine repairs, and save the world. Should be easy, right?"

Katja finds a portable toolcase and fills it with as complete a toolset as they have salvaged.

Katja and Menocal finish a short inspection of the tools. Most are self-activating smart matter, designed for use in zero gee. They'll stick to whatever you apply them to, and come off easily. Designed to minimize accidental loss during acceleration. Carrying them is a matter of finding attachment points on one's own body, but there's a cylindrical frame that seems designed specifically for the task.

Meanwhile, Damon's been considering other exits. Two doors to their left and right are likewise closed, and there's a hatchway leading down.

Menocal says, "OK, so turn your brain on how something like this might be made-together, to tell you where to find life support. "

> (OOC) Menocal says, "..."

Katja loads up the frame, checking to make sure the weight doesn't drag her in any direction.

> (OOC) Damon says, "Is 'down' a matter of convention, or are there up-down cues indicating this environment is supposed to be under gravity?"

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 for 73

Damon looks further. The workshop seems to have a definite orientation, suggesting that work while under acceleration, or in gravity, is expected. Something about the hatches bothers him, but the bother is idle academic curiosity rather than the immediacy of 'oh shit life is about to end'.

Katja takes the room and it's condition into account, and tries to figure out the most likely placement for both the pod room and life support system access.

> (OOC) Katja rolls 1d100 vs. 76 for 88 (critical failure!)

> (OOC) Katja says, "Nooooo!"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "this is why I'm not the leader. I have bad ideas all the time."

"Any reason to pick one door over another?" asks Damon to his companions at large. He's already pushed off the entryway toward the floor hatchway. To himself, he mutters, "I hope Doc's on here somewhere. Or a fork of him, at least."

> (OOC) Doc says, "opening floor!"

Katja says, "Uh..." She winces and looks like something just pounded on her skull from the inside. "Not quite right yet. Let's just move on. I have what I need.""

Damon gets ahold of the release for the floor hatch and starts to operate it. There's a grinding, and a strong whiff of ozone emerges. But what he finds is some sort of conduit, for human access to the power distribution systems for this ship. Most of it is obviously fried beyond usability; that much is obvious even from here.

Katja says, "You're kidding."

Katja sighs.

Menocal says, "So... does this mean we're molested?"

This isn't just a malfunction - or if it is, it's a really serious one. It's more likely that the ship was attacked and left to drift.

Katja peers at Menocal. "You haven't hacked me with some ridiculous survival in dead space game, have you?

Menocal says, "I wouldn't do that. Or if I did I put myself in it too. And him. And I haven't had time to do all of it."

Menocal says, "Maybe Doc sneezed and released gamesnot."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Restoring power here will probably get life support going again. LS is typically the most durable and self-healing system a ship has"

"Shut up, you two. Don't waste air," snaps Damon. "Katja, any point going down there?"

> (OOC) Katja says, "If it's completely fried to the point of being molten, how can it be repaired without spare parts?"

Menocal makes a note to hack Damon's underwear and make it ride up a lot.

> (OOC) Doc says, "The hibernation room right now is the only reliable source for power conduits you can think of. They won't handle the load for the whole ship, but they can probably power up some basic functions. and there's the other 3 rooms you haven't seen et"

Katja says, "Not without parts to replace that melted mess with. Let's see what else we may be able to use."

> (OOC) Doc says, "choices are: explore to the right; explore up; explore down; salvage the pods and try to repair now; or other."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Time estimate for repairs with pods?"

"Got it," says Damon. "If this is a lab, there might be something in the adjoining rooms." He kicks off the floor to the door on the right from their entry point. "Stand by for opening."

> (OOC) Doc says, "To try to route power to life support from here: 3 hours."

Katja grabs wall.

> (OOC) Doc says, "that's time to tear open the pods, extract cabling, trace the leads with no computer assistance at all, wire it together, and test."

Menocal gets a tool that we have a duplicate of already and readies it for throwing, hitting with, or perhaps groin injury.

> (OOC) Katja says, "Got it. Thanks. :)"

Working the door mechanism, Damon starts it going. And at the first hint of outrushing air, seals it back as fast as he possibly can. There's vacuum, or at least very low pressure, on the other side. A miniscule amount of air was lost, nothing to seriously endanger the group. But it does mean that whatever's to be found there is off limits - for now.

Katja makes a disgusted noise.

> (OOC) Damon says, "Other door!"

Menocal closes her eyes and starts to try to poke at the forming mesh while this is happening. If she can help it get up and running, they can improve their ability to communicate.

The team's Muses all report. Two radio-capable devices are now online and available for mesh access. One claims to be an automech that was activated by the hibernation pods' release. It is standing by for commands. The other is an emergency radio beacon, which reports that its aerial is unavailable for broadcast.

> (OOC) Damon says, "I've just picked up a fault in the AE-35 unit."

Katja asks the automech for the ship's schematics.

> (OOC) Remus has connected.

> (OOC) Remus is v. late, sorry.

Carefully Damon releases the seals on the other door and edges it open. This time the atmosphere seems steady, but there's an awful smell coming from that part of the ship.

> (OOC) Doc says, "Remus, lemme know when you are caught up on the log."

The automech begins transmitting.

> (OOC) Doc says, "pause"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Awful smell like artificial toxins, rotting corpses, or unknown? (pausing)"

> (OOC) Doc says, "rot, but not corpses. Organic stores, you'd guess - food, maybe, or unsealed biologicals."

Katja makes a face and switches to her oxygen reserve. "Let's not keep that open for long."

Katja says, "I'm getting the ship's layout. Will retransmit when complete."

"Understood," says Damon, closing the door. "One more door to check at this point." He pushes off, heading for the hibernation chamber.

Menocal follows Damon, being unsuitable in general for ship things that don't involve causing trouble. She might be useful.

"This is a custom Small Lander and Orbital Transfer Vehicle, or SLOTV, designated _Alexander Nevsky_," the schematics purr. "Built to accommodate 65 passengers in live conditions or hibernation, along with a crew complement of 8. No military-grade weapons or defenses." A three-dimensional map of the ship is available, with much of it marked as blockaded or unavailable - the automech is already gathering data from the local mesh, which consists basically of the XP feeds of three living humans.

Katja switches her reserve off and waves a hand in front of her face to try to disperse the smell.

As Damon passes, he happens to note the hibernation indicators on one more pod. Remus Greyrobe is finally waking up.

> (OOC) Damon will halt his exploration until Remus is fully conscious, alert, and briefed. Fortunately, the latter won't take long.

Katja says, "Well, that's something. We may have a way off of this thing if we have somewhere to go."

Katja makes sure that the others are getting the feed of the ship map.

The party's position is easily determined. They're presently in the crew's hibernation chamber, on the uppermost of three decks. Below them are passenger accommodations, and below that is steerage - cargo areas, consumables, and the like. There is a control room fore, and a propulsion system aft, with astrometric sensors embedded all through the hull.

Katja says, "We should split up. One team for parts salvage and one to see if there's any gear or supplies to recover?""

> (OOC) Remus says, "Ready."

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. Remus, come out of hibernation. Three familiar looking people are here"

> (OOC) Doc says, "the last few weeks are basically gone from your memory."

Katja says, "Or everyone for salvage, and then you can go roam about while I do repairs. I can divert power now, but I'd rather not deplete the pods unless we really need to."

"Hold," says Damon. "We've got Remus waking up. Let's get him up to speed and see what he can contribute." The military man takes up station beside the unopened door and waits for the wakeup cycle to complete.

In the hibernation bay, the pod holding Remus finally opens. He pushes the lid aside weakly with one hand, and steadies himself with the other. Leaving the pod sets off a coughing fit; it's a minute before he can breathe easy. He's only been frozen twice before, in diplomatic training, and his natural body apparently finds the experience... objectionable.

> (OOC) Remus thinks of something else

"Damon," Remus rasps. "And Katja. So this is a firewall op. And this is my original skin. So either we're really here, or this is a virtual nightmare."

Katja says, "Either way, we're on a clock.""

"Welcome back to the land of the living," says Damon crisply, once the coughing passes. "Quick summary: We're on a small spaceship with just over a day of life support left. Katja has a feed on ship schematics, and I was just in the process of exploring our physical environment. What can you contribute to us not asphyxiating?"

Menocal doesn't have her cham skin active. She must be naturally unnoticable. Notes this for later.

> (OOC) Damon says, "In crisis situations Damon tends to ignore anything that isn't either immediately contributing or impairing his chances for survival."

Katja gives Menocal an amused glance.

Remus pulls the data out of the awakening mesh. "So we are. Well. With the power grid fried, that's a tall order. But..." Remus points to the lighting tubes. "Those are still running, somehow. If we're lucky, they're strains suitable for carbon fixation. That will keep the air and water going for us. Then we just have to avoid freezing to death."

> (OOC) Remus goofs

> (OOC) Remus says, "At least, I THINK se."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Is it even remotely true?"

The ship's schematics help, to an extent. Damon can figure out what he expects to find behind a door, but never what will really be there. The automech has figured out where it is - one deck down, maybe 5 meters behind the cockpit. It's stationary and apparently able to move, but its visual and infrared transmissions don't suggest anything of interest.

> (OOC) Damon says, "This reminds me of \_Suspended\_."

> (OOC) Doc says, "These strains themselves probably aren't, but if the /Nevsky/ is using this stuff, there's undoubtedly suitable strains aboard."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Has anybody found a window? No?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "no windows yet. there's no external sensors online."

> (OOC) Katja says, "We're in the interior of the ship."

> (OOC) Menocal says, "we found vacuum!"

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 for 21

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 for 43

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 for 91

Katja wonders if Nevsky can get a shot of a star chart up in the cockpit?

> (OOC) Remus says, "Well. Until we get power, a comm, or a portal, we can scavenge for portable life support and power, search the ship, or hack the bacteria."

The automech activates. It relates its XP feed to the four living humans. Delicately, its thrusters rotate and move it about. The cockpit is entirely deserted and lightless; nobody comes here in the dark, since the really vital systems are back in engineering. There's no hardcopy visible here. Everything used to steer and position the ship must be on the computers. The blast shields are closed, so the shell can't even see out into space.

> (OOC) Remus says, "I just wonder how lost we could get in three weeks."

Katja tries to get a position from the video feed.

Aside from the hibernation pods, the only other likely source for power conduits that Katja can think of is propulsion. The ship needs considerable power to manage the hydrogen-oxygen rocket that pushes it, and the engine is a standard XT-201 Responsible Dreamer model from four years ago: everything is laid out the same way, right up to the interface with the ship meant to carry it.

The schematics indicate that some of Remus' hopes may be justified. Some of the lower-level functions of the ship are operated via a bio-network, weaving pseudo-neurons in self-sustaining anaerobic organisms that live on long-term chemical reactions. There should be enough of a working lab to tinker.

> (OOC) Doc says, "alright. your next moves are fairly straightforward. want to get to them, or do you guys have other ideas?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Is there any part of the ship we haven't been in yet?"

Katja hmm's. "The engine has to have a pretty hefty power source. So that's two. We've still got over a day of life-support left. Pods can be an emergency power source. We still need food, water, access to nav, and use of the engines to get from where ever the hell we're drifting to civilization.

Katja says, "Weapons might be nice, too, but I bet we're alone for now."

"Water won't be an issue," Remus says. "And we may need guns, but we'll need comm more."

Katja looks toward Damon. "So?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "The automech is Damon's remote, right? If we can find a way to send it outside, have a look, do a stellar fix?"

Menocal has no useful skills for this, so just watches.

> (OOC) Doc says, "as far as you can tell it came with the ship"

> (OOC) Doc says, "you can direct it to find and use an airlock, sure."

Katja looks to Menocal. "Do you have any skill with comm systems?"

Menocal says, "Nnnnnnnno."

> (OOC) Remus says, "I'm a little confused, who is driving the automech now?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "nobody specifically. it'll take commands from any of you"

"No military threat that I can discern," Damon replies to Katja. "If there was, it's already left us for dead. From now, I'm at your disposal. Let me know if you need anything lifted or lasered."

The automech reports in. No other signs of life on the deck below, though it hasn't moved since last ordered. It's providing non-administrative access to all surviving humans, per emergency protocol, and reports itself as fully functional.

> (OOC) Doc says, "Basically it's the sort of thing you leave behind when everything else aboardship has gone to shit."

Remus fiddles with the automech's interface. "This thing is already in a depressurized area, right? So it can run in vaccum. So why not send it to have a look outside, and find out where we are?"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "Seriously, Menocal has absolutely no skills that are useful here."

> (OOC) Doc says, "you will very soon"

"I'll do that," says Damon. "You and Katja have the most skills in extending our life support. I'll take the automech on EVA, see what I can see. Once established, I'll hand over to Katja in case she can get a star fix."

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. Damon's got his thing. Katja, your plan? Menocal? Remus?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Get to work on the organic system. See if we can make it do life support for four people. Seems like a modest ask, if the entire craft could hold 60 or more."

Katja says, "Ok. Remus is on organics, Damon's on the EVA. Menocal and I will try to get to engineering. Sound like a plan?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "unless there's objections now, I'll get to that. :)"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "Menocal is going to watch and hold things, as she lacks any technical skills to be useful in salvage work on a ship."

Katja says, "Unless you need help, Remus? Menocal sounds like just an extra pair of hands righ now."

Katja says, "Until we get more systems up."

Remus looks up from his task, glances Katja over briefly, and Menocal over more thoroughly. "Maybe you can find Doc? I don't know the rest of you, apart from Firewall. Everyone else is here. If Doc is around, it won't take much hackery to find him."

Katja raises an eyebrow at Menocal.

Menocal says, "There's not much here to work with. I've been trying to get traces on the local mesh but we're it"

Menocal would have pinged her ghostrider straight off, so unless someone ripped that out and replaced it with a klondike bar, Doc isn't in it.

> (OOC) Doc says, "yeah, no sign from Doc"

> (OOC) Doc says, "Alright. here we go with repair efforts!"

Damon directs the automech in a basic EVA. The machine is smart enough that just relaying the intent is enough to get it going, though Damon does have the option of jamming along with it if he cares. The 'mech exits port side after a few moments of cycling through the airlock and begins relaying star data.

> (OOC) Remus hmm

Remus follows the schematics to the bioengineering lab, twenty meters fore. This is where the awful smell was coming from, but he's prepared for it (and has smelled worse). The instruments he'll need are all offline, but he can charge a few up from the hibernation pods without damaging them.

Damon waits until it's finished charting the available stars, then sends the automech in a circuit around the exterior, to see if anything else of interest or concern is visible.

> (OOC) Damon says, "Like Sol."

Katja finds something promising. Of the eighteen power trunks to the engine, at least fifteen are fully intact. The heavy electromagnetic activity around the engines necessitates equally heavy shielding, and the ship can be reduced to two-thirds thrust and still spare more than enough cabling to restore the damaged trunks she saw in the engineering lab. Full restoration should be possible within twenty minutes.

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. anyone: best of Pilot: Spacecraft or Navigation"

> (OOC) Remus says, "I have a suggestion for Menocal. She's really good with investigation and knowledgable about the various factions. Based on the accessible areas of the ship, the non-spimy contents of the other cryopods and supply lockers, etc... who used to own this thing? Where were they headed?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "I mean, a grocery receipt from the 7/11 on the other side of the Tartarus Gate would tell us a lot, but it won't be on the mesh."

> (OOC) Katja rolls 1d100 vs. 70 for 50 (success, MoS 20)

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. And now Hardware: Aerospace"

> (OOC) Remus has about 0 capability in those areas.

> (OOC) Katja rolls 1d100 vs. 76 for 9 (exceptional success, MoS 67)

> (OOC) Katja says, "Oops, I did engineering"

> (OOC) Doc says, "the roll stands, it's fine"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Ok."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Engineering is complementary to your Hardware roll, but a 9 kicks anyone's ass."

> (OOC) Katja says, "True. n.n"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Even Damon or Menocal could've got /something/ out of a 9."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Like I'd let you near the engines."

It takes only a few minutes for Katja to lug cabling and start rerouting. Thanks to the providential placement of the automech, what might have taken hours is done in under 250 seconds. Lights begin coming on - still only the emergency lights, as the computers aboard are probably equally damaged. But the emergency sensors and other apparatus are operational.

Local devices begin forming a mesh, linking with the party. And one of the internal sensors begins blaring: HIBERNATION ATTEMPTS INTERRUPTED. EMERGENCY CONTAINMENT PROTOCOL. UPPER HIBERNATION CHAMBER BEING SEALED OFF. DO NOT APPROACH.

> (OOC) Damon says, "hoshit"

Katja facepalms. "Shit."

Doc flickers into existence a minute later, only as a mesh presence. His AR avatar has yet to stabilize. His disorientation stems from a different source than hibernation, but it's clear that he's only now recovering consciousness.

The sensors begin providing more up-to-date information: "Four hibernation pods containing contagious specimens. Do not release them. Repeat: do not release them."

> (OOC) Doc says, "this isn't just a passive alert; you're pretty sure you can interact with it verbally or with mesh queries."

The instant the alarms go off, Damon goes into a crouch and frantically scans his surroundings, right hand swinging in all directions. Only once it becomes clear that the noise doesn't indicate an attack does he unbend - and breathe a sigh of relief. Doc's aboard and he's all right, at least as much as any of the rest of the team.

Menocal pokes the mesh. "What kind of contamination do they have?"

The sensors cogitate for a moment. "Anomalous biological activity reported by hibernation nanomachines. Nature of infection unknown. Please alert competent medical personnel."

Remus says, "Exactly four specimens? Does it mean us?""

"Negative. Currently resuscitated subjects do not show infection."

> (OOC) Doc says, "There were eight pods total - for the 8 crewmembers of the ship. You four, and the other four pods were also occupied by strangers"

Katja says, "Well, keep those sealed. I'm suddenly glad we didn't divert all of the power."

> (OOC) Remus says, "It was a 50/50 guess. And... Murphy's Law."

"Containment protocol will continue until abated by authorized personnel," the alarm announces, then subsides into the background.

Katja says, "What is the nature of the infection?"

"Anomalous biological activity reported by hibernation nanomachines. Nature of infection unknown."

Katja says, "Doc? Are you sorted yet?"

Doc snorts a bit via audio over the mesh. He begins muttering in Chinese, realizes that translation isn't online yet, and tries English. "Pardon me, so very sorry. I am at your service, friends."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Personal translation is available via your inserts, if we have anyone who isn't an English-speaker. Doc has to rely on the ship's computer"

"I'm a physician and gene specialist," Remus says. He puts the algae on hold for the moment. "Let me have a look at the data from the hibernation nanos."

Katja says, "Please assist Remus, Doc."

Remus finds himself afflicted with dozens of different displays; his AR rig begins sorting them out by relevance and priority, until he's got something approaching a reasonable set.

Menocal hms. "Also, Doc, do you know where you are on the ship? I might be able to let you help people more directly if we can find your stack.

> (OOC) Remus says, "Computer! Firehose, Earl Gray, hot."

"Stack? I was an infomorph and still am," Doc answers cheerfully. "But I think I can move myself into that automech you have running outside."

Menocal says, "You don't have something to download to in case of needing to move fast? huh. Okay. "

Katja says, "Doc, my appologies for forgetting. What are you a doctor of?"

"I dabble quite a bit," laughs Doc. "The sciences - biology, chemistry, nanotechnology, robotics, habitat design. If I see anything useful, I'll report it immediately."

Katja says, "Right. Help Remus."

Katja finishes up her repairs and heads off to see what state the comms are in.

"Thanks, but I'm okay," Remus replies softly. "We still don't know where we are. If Doc can drive the automech, then maybe he can get a fix. Or possibly find an antenna out there that isn't junk."

The starfields on the drone are finished, and it's ready to return to the ship. A few seconds are enough for an experienced spacer like Katja to locate the _Alexander Nevsky_'s derelict remains: still in the general neighborhood of Saturn, but well beyond even the trojans. It'll be some time getting back. If they make it.

Doc speaks up again, sounding a little worried. "I ah, I have been attempting this. It seems that my current position allows communication only. I am unable to give computer commands for anything else."

Katja says, "We're near Saturn, but out in the boonies, of course. I'm heading to comms now. Let's get systems up before we try to navigate anywhere. I will also be your pilot for this trip, unless one of you have that skill set."

"Then let's go fetch you, Doc" says Damon. "Any idea where you're stored? If you don't know, work with Katja and the schematics to come up with a guess. Menocal, you've got the ghostrider, come with me. We're gonna go get Doc."

Menocal nods, and follows Damon.

"WARNING." The familiar voice of the contamination alert has come back to life. "Hibernation nanomachines compromised and nonresponsive. Emergency resuscitation process commencing. Protocol violation in crew habitat chamber. Isolation protocol still in effect. Do not enter the hibernation chamber. Repeat: do not enter the hibernation chamber. Subjects self-resuscitating..."
