# Untergang 2011-05-12

> (OOC) Log "Untergang-2011-05-12" started by Doc at Thu May 12 21:25:04 2011 CDT (OOC)

Firewall SITREP: Aboard the _Alexander Nevsky_, a SLOTV in deep space. Four unknowns in hypothermic hibernation, emerging in violation of safety protocols. Five active Firewall agents, four sleeved into biomorphs, one infomorph. Ship has just over a day of life support remaining and is badly damaged; cause unknown. Details to follow.

---

> (OOC) Remus says, "I hereby nominate Damon to weld the doors shut."

> (OOC) Doc says, "any questions before we begin? if you are unsure of where we left off, the previous logs are posted on pandoraslair.org"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "with his face!"

> (OOC) Katja says, "I think I managed to restore power at the end, right?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "you've been able to restore some power, yeah."

> (OOC) Remus says, "We were working on life support. Then the smelly cheese started to thaw itself out."

While the alarms are blaring, Menocal's HUD pings her - a subject of interest has been made known to her muse, and now a call-out appears like a ghostly neon sign next to one of the walls. CREW PERSONAL POSSESSIONS, it reads, along with a manifest. It includes all of what she remembers carrying. A hatch in the wall pops open with a mentally-related command, revealing everything.

Along with the team's own gear, there's a variety of weapons inside.

Menocal says, "Gear! Guns!" She reaches inside. "Moshenka!" she cries out, pulling out a shiny black tool."

> (OOC) Doc says, "alright. Containment protocol is about to be violated. Rubber-meets-road: whatever's still in the hibernation pods will be getting loose on the rest of the ship, and the computer doesnt want that to happen but can't really stop it."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Do grenades have remote detonation capabilities, or just timers?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "You can remote-detonate on radio signals, by verbal command, whatever"

> (OOC) Doc notes: Deck plans for the Alexander Nevsky: https://docs.google.com/drawings/pub?id=1Oqaah23YKfsHZ\_OY9UivkIJuy5JEgJbfDa-2CMadTVA&w=960&h=720

Remus interrupts his analysis of the threatening bioform to speak to Menocal. "We might need the guns up here," he says, "if the hatch doesn't hold. And speaking of that, we need a way to seal them shut. Anyone seen a welder?"

An audible **ping** appears on Remus' HUD, with an option to share: a tools manifest, including plasma-torches and other welding apparatus. The last known location appears as a call-out on his display, in the upper engineering workshop.

Menocal goes through the case, pulling out first a bag, and then guns. Guns go in bag.

Katja works to get control of the hatches, so she can program a cascade seal off.

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 for 72

> (OOC) Remus says, "Who is closest to the upper workshop right now?"

> (OOC) Damon has connected.

> (OOC) Doc says, "Damon, log is running. lemme know when you are caught up"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Probably me, looking at this map. Most likely place for me to work on life support would have been the upper biolab. And... oh. The workshop is adjacent to the hibernation chamber. But only one side of it."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Correct"

Katja says, "Menocal, if all of our stuff is in there then there should be a bag of grenades, too. We might need those. I can lock the doors, but someone should weld to make sure they can't be opened again."

> (OOC) Doc says, "You guys can position yourselves more or less wherever makes sense"

> (OOC) Remus poses for himself then.

> (OOC) Katja rolls 1d100 vs. 66 for 00 (critical success!)

> (OOC) Katja says, "Score. o.o"

Menocal says, "Ah, yes, grade A boom-booms!" She grabs the grenades and ties the bag to a strap"

Katja says, "Result! I bought the torch holder some time. It'll run out at some point, though, so I suggest whoever is going to weld get a move on it."

Remus notes the position of the welders on the map... two rooms away from him, right next to one of the two hatches into the hibernation bay. <i>Convenient,<i> he thinks. "The ship showed me where the welders are," he says. "I've got one end of the icebox. I'm going to send Damon to get the other."

> (OOC) Remus says, "I really hope these things are point and shoot."

> (OOC) Doc says, "yeah, it's not a tough thing to use."

> (OOC) Damon says, "Sounds like a plan. Damon's likely to treat it as a very short-range flamethrower, though :)"

Menocal delivers guns (and in Katja's case grenades) to the physicals

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. you two want to get posing? Damon, the only way to the other side of the hibhernation chamber is via EVA - but you're wearing a flexible spacer uniform, which doubles as a vacc suit."

> (OOC) Katja says, "I'm trying to figure out where I am. Power plant?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "if that's what makes sense then yes, you'd be there."

> (OOC) Doc says, "As mentioned you guys can assume you started in whatever location of the ship you want - the mesh will take care of your communications with each other."

Katja takes a sticky grenade, and sticks it on the ceiling of the upper engineering workshop.

"I'll take the far side," says Damon over the local mesh. "Prepping for EVA. Menocal, have my toys ready for me at the port airlock below biolab. I may need them if far door goes wrong."

Katja tosses a sticky concussion grenade at Menocal. "Here. In case you get in trouble."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Damon: aside from posing, also gimme a simple Freefall test (50). You'll still make it around, but success or failure will determine if there's complications."

> (OOC) Damon says, "what's the roll command for EP rolls?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "'roll on 50' will do."

> (OOC) Damon rolls 1d100 vs. 50 for 43 (success, MoS 7)

> (OOC) Doc says, "k, proceed :)"

> (OOC) Remus got sigphone, reads backscroll

> (OOC) Remus ok

> (OOC) Remus says, "So we're gonna weld the doors shut. Any other way out of the fridge?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "not that's on the schematics."

The EVA is relatively uneventful - most of the port side handholds turn out to be intact, allowing Damon to make his way to the aft airlock without using any reaction mass. As the airlock cycles to let him back in, Damon decides to leave the hood up - if the doors fail while he's welding, he may need to head for the 'lock in a hurry.

Katja grabs her body armor on the way back to the console, and puts it on once there.

Menocal says, "how bad would it be if we blew a hole in the vacuum-side of the fridge and let the air out? I mean, that might kill them, yes?"

> (OOC) Katja says, "crap, brb"

Remus does his best to famliarize himself with the welding kit, and keeps the sensor data from the hibernation bay relegated to a window in the corner of his eye. Part of that is a low-res video feed; he's half expecting the pods to burst open and reveal bug-eyed monsters. "Depends on the threat, Menocal" he says. "If they can jailbreak from cryostasis, they can probably compensate for vaccum. For a while, anyway."

Menocal says, "Ah, okay, thank you. wasn't sure. I mean, something woke us up, maybe woke them up instead of them jailbreaking."

As Remus watches, the pods begin to open. Then the doors are literally punched off their hinges - not a small thing for a humanoid to accomplish.

> (OOC) Remus says, "How are these welds going? o\_o;;"

Damon thinks for a moment, as the welder slowly works its way along the doorseam. "And if they can, we'd have let them out. Remus, let me know what you learn about-" He hears the muffled bang from the far side. "Schiesse! Remus, what was that?"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Back. Sorry."

'Humanoid' is generous. What emerges appears to be still rapidly mutating or evolving. The outer surface has a glistening sheen to it. Remus' first guess is that some of the carbon content of the humans in the pods is being repurposed into diamond, although how the alchemy is being done is beyond him. The three creatures that are stepping out into the hibernation chamber are too organic to have been synthmorphs originally, and nobody would put synths into stasis anyway.

Menocal begins to recite odd phrases in a low monotone.

> (OOC) Katja says, "Can I flush the oxygen from that chamber?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "you can try. Hardware: Aerospace, +30 for Engineering specialty, -30 for trying to fight the computer"

> (OOC) Doc says, "(since it's reluctant to allow anyone to do that sort of thing)"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "issuing as many different standard VX quit commands as can be thought of."

Remus nearly chokes on his words. "It's them. They're being rebuilt. They punched their way free of the pods. Keep welding."

> (OOC) Remus says, "You're attempting to disbelieve?"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "I lack the tech skills do to much here. If this is a VX and I can get out of it, I can get you guys out of it; otherwise I can stay out of your way. Win-draw."

> (OOC) Katja rolls 1d100 vs. 76 for 79 (failure, MoF 3)

> (OOC) Katja says, "Noooooo! ;.;"

> (OOC) Doc says, "pose failure. the welding proceeds."

Katja bangs the side of the console in anger. "Stupid! It won't let me flush the O2."

> (OOC) Remus says, "You could try talking to them, Menocal. Maybe we can reason with them. Failing that, maybe you can confuse them. And failing that, play them some octopus porn. o\_o"

A buzzing noise comes over the mesh's voice channels. No - not buzzing. Words. A mechanical-sounding translation begins to render itself. "_That won't help._"

On the display, one of the figures steps - on legs rapidly evolving into digitigrade posture - and smashes a hand against the spime Remus was using. Another one inside the hibernation room activates, showing what the creature was doing. It seems to be interfacing somehow with the device.

> (OOC) Remus says, "Oh crap. o\_o"

Katja blinks at the screen. "Shit. SHIT."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Cut the sensors."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Now we know why they fragged the transciever."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Cut the sensors? o.o;"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "uh, is that an infosec roll to try to cut the sensors?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "Yes"

> (OOC) Doc says, "straight infosec will do"

> (OOC) Menocal rolls 1d100 vs. 65 for 78 (failure, MoF 13)

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 45 for 55 (critical failure!)

> (OOC) Doc says, ".... interesting. Both parties fail at their attempt. Round 2, try again!"

> (OOC) Menocal rolls 1d100 vs. 65 for 23 (exceptional success, MoS 42)

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 45 for 94 (exceptional failure, MoF 49)

> (OOC) Doc says, "you interfere with the attacker, go ahead and pose it, M."

Menocal stops mumbling and shoves a cable into the datasystem port, the other end going through a small device then into a dataport in her head. She flubs the first out of fear, then manages to spike the sensors, shutting them down.

Menocal says, "Okay. Sensors cut."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Remus, your feed is also lost - you can't track their activities any more"

> (OOC) Remus says, "I think we can safely assume that they'll keep trying to get out. I think we can also assume that they WILL."

> (OOC) Remus says, "How are the welds?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "you guys doing the welding, give me a roll on your best Hardware skill, +30 (the tools are exceptionally helpful even to beginners)"

> (OOC) Doc says, "those without hardware, this is a COG-linked skill, so if you lack it, roll COG+30"

> (OOC) Damon rolls 1d100 vs. 80 for 80 (success, MoS 0)

> (OOC) Remus says, "one moment"

> (OOC) Remus says, "I don't seem to have hardware skills. What's the roll command?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "'roll on 63' or 'roll on 50' or whatever your effective skill is"

> (OOC) Remus rolls 1d100 vs. 53 for 97 (exceptional failure, MoF 44)

> (OOC) Remus says, "... oh shit."

Damon's job is finished satisfactorily. Remus, on the other hand, managed to misread some of the more basic details his AR was feeding him. The software simply misjudged his experience level and tailored its instructions badly, but the result is the same. A quick visual inspection of the weld and the torch's expert system concludes: MEAN TIME TO FAILURE, 1.5 HOURS.

> (OOC) Doc says, "that's assuming no stress on the door, but you know that's not likely. "

> (OOC) Doc says, "what do you want to do"

Katja says, "So..."

Katja says, "Anyone know how to kill the weird mutant things?"

Remus drops the welder. "I made a bad job of it," he says. "We won't be able to keep them isolated." He leans forward and begins to tap on the door, in an old code... morse. It takes a precious half a minute to hammer out a simple question: WHAT DO YOU WANT

The forward-facing door to the hab chamber resonates as something immensely strong whacks it from the other side.

> (OOC) Doc swaps those

Menocal says, "If this was a VX there would be some kind of superweapon somewhere in here, or we could blow a hole in the hull and ejectt them into space..."

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 60 for 72 (failure, MoF 12)

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 70 for 41 (success, MoS 29)

Damon receives the report from Remus' torch via the mesh. "Gosh-darned fucking hell," he says. "Keep Remus covered, Katja. I'll be right back." He heads for the airlock, and briefly considers emergency quick-open, before deciding against it. One, this is a bad time to be blown out the airlock, and two, they're still in a life support emergency and, provided they survive the monsters in the box, they'll need every ounce of air they can get.

> (OOC) Katja says, "What deck are they on again?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "upper deck"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Right. Just checking. XD"

Katja moves into position to cover the door.

Remus recoils from the hatch. "I don't think they'll negotiate," he says flatly, "So I'm back to my other specialty." He dives back into the last few minutes of sensor data collected before Menocal isolated the room; if there's any chance of stopping them hard, it will be a weakness in the nanotech. But he has to choke back despair: anything as vicious as this won't have an obvious killswitch.

"Remus, Katja," adds Damon, as he goes topside again. "Plant some grenades on the starboard workshop door, then cover them from outside the workshop. Make sure you close your door before blowing the 'nades." The soldier of fortune makes his way along the dorsal spine of the ship, using his left hand to maneuver while keeping a weapon trained on the horizon of the starboard hull.

> (OOC) Damon says, "Katja should be able to catch what Damon's getting at. The starboard corridor's open to vacuum."

> (OOC) Doc says, "so you probably don't want to detonate until the bad guys actually enter the workshop - the explosive decompression will really make this work"

> (OOC) Remus says, "I get it. There's a chance of blowing them out if we retreat to the power plant?"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Correct. And Damon's outside to pick them off if they get blown out."

> (OOC) Remus says, "How big is your boomstick?"

Katja nods, and hauls her bag of grenades to the workshop. She hands a few to Remus. "They're sticky. Just group them near the center on that side of the wall. I'll take this side."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Damon's got whatever his normal weapon(s) would be, plus a small selection of railguns - they'll fire in vacuum just fine"

Menocal takes a moment to check the mesh and count who's there. And possibly if there's some poking from that door.

> (OOC) Damon says, "If Menocal got me my gear before I went EVA, my boomstick of choice is probably the SMG."

> (OOC) Damon says, "The particle beam bolter would've been tuned for atmosphere work."

> (OOC) Menocal got people their stuff as soon as I could after finding it

Meanwhile, the habitat's door is slowly being undogged from the other side. The computer lockout has magnetic clamps active. But the creatures beyond that forbidding portal are being metamorphosed into something against which a magnetic field backed by the ship's fusion power plant cannot hold.

> (OOC) Menocal has disconnected.

> (OOC) Menocal has connected.

> (OOC) Menocal says, "sorry"

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. are grenades in position?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Any luck with analyzing the hostile organism?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "it's a fast-evolving adaption of transhuman biology. nothing changes this fast - it's got to be some weird TITAN shit."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Refresh my memory on what TITAN means. Weakly godlike extraterrestrial AI?"

Katja grabs the grenade she stuck to the ceiling earlier. No use wasting. "That should blow a nice hole."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Not extraterrestrial - the TITANs originated on Earth, created by humans. They went Skynet on everyone's ass and slaughtered billions, 10 years ago."

> (OOC) Doc says, "They caused a hard-take off technological singularity and are regularly credited with all manner of incredibly advanced nanotechnology, the Pandora Gates, and other weirdness."

> (OOC) Remus says, "I like Damon's plan. Except for the part that they'll be drifting around in deep space and might run into something."

> (OOC) Doc says, "it'll have to do. Damon, you're in position?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "So that's why everyone uploaded in a hurry. Before the ground beneath their feet dissolved."

> (OOC) Damon says, "That's why Damon's also going to shoot the hell out of them. In position."

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. Damon, want to pose the blowout? Everyone else should be /getting the fuck out of the engineering workshop right now/, because they WILL get through that door."

Katja says, "Remus, did you get any nutritional sludge made? Let's check it out."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Gah, how do you correct typos?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "changeline 153=old typo version=new corrected version"

> (OOC) Doc says, "it will do a search/replace on just the text you give, so changeline 153=and=any will do"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Cool!"

Remus retreats into the power plant, leaving Katja to rig the workshop. "They're superhuman nanotech. Maybe even TITAN tech. I don't think recycler sludge will even make them blink."

There is no actual sound, though Damon's muse provides a simulated detonation sound effect as it interprets the sudden vibration through the hull - and Damon /can _see the flash around the hole's edges as the grenades go off. Three bizarre creatures tumble into view, their crystalline diamondoid armor glinting in the faint light of Sol. Damon wastes no time on f_f identification before opening fire - if any of his companions had left themselves inside the workshop, they're already as good as dead anyway.

Menocal had retreated with Remus. Perhaps even in front of Remus. Specifically so she's not caught in anything terrible.

Katja had been suggesting that they take part in refreshments while Damon did the muscle work, but no one got the joke on the way to the lab.

Damon's visual inspection of his hits tell him what he guessed: not too much serious structural damage. On the other hand, this lot will not be coming back to the ship, and the odds of them encountering anything in the solar system within the next millennium is slim.

> (OOC) Doc says, "you guys appear to be safe. there's a fourth subject in quarantine, but it hasn't left its pod (that you know of)"

> (OOC) Doc says, "feel free to regroup and figure out your next move"

---

> (OOC) Remus says, "The depressurized area now includes the hibernation bay, right?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "Correct."

Menocal says, "Should I try to de-spike the sensors so we can see what if anything is going on?"

Damon moves closer to the hole. "Do that, Menocal. I want to space the last pod just in case, but I'd rather know for sure that it's not moving at the moment."

Menocal nods, and bends to the task.

> (OOC) Menocal rolls 1d100 vs. 65 for 26 (exceptional success, MoS 39)

Remus reconstructs his analysis routine, watching for signs of the... organism? Weapon? These words seem to weak. "Curse," he mutters under his breath. "It's a curse."

"You fellows seem to have matters in hand," comments Doc, now that the excitement has settled down. "I don't suppose one of you could triangulate on my wireless signal..?"

"We'll be with you in a moment, Doc," Remus adds. "Just making sure that they're really gone."

Katja checks to see if power was compromised at all by the blowout.

The workshop is currently unavailable, unless Katja wants to breach life support, or go EVA - but remote sensors indicate a minimal level of damage. The power plant itself, of course, is heavily shielded, and the power conduits were only slightly jarred by the explosion. The ship isn't yet very functional, but it isn't any _less_ functional.

> (OOC) Damon says, "Any word on the status in the crew hibernation?"

The hibernation chamber is still open to vacuum. The last remaining pod has sealed itself and won't release its patient until air is available again.

Katja says, "Damon, do you want to take care of the last one now, or should I go back to repairs?"

> (OOC) Damon says, "I assume the cryopods are built into the wall?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "they're fixed to the chamber to prevent damage during collisions and such but they could be detached and moved around."

> (OOC) Damon says, "OK. I want to detach it and send it into space. If the poor bastard wasn't infected after all, tough luck for him."

> (OOC) Doc says, "things have no weight, but it's pretty massive. You'll want Katja's help to figure out the attachment points and how to unhook it safely."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Make sure Doc isn't in it first."

> (OOC) Doc says, "you could also do that, yes. ^\_^;;;"

> (OOC) Doc says, "triangulating wireless signals and locating the computer where Doc's transmitting from is a Research task, for anyone who cares to roll."

> (OOC) Doc says, "if you guys cooperate, it's +10 per extra person"

"Katja, give me a hand with this thing," Damon replies. "I want to know how to unhook it safely. Anyone have any luck finding Doc yet?"

> (OOC) Damon has Research of 15. Not likely to succeed as the director of that effort.

> (OOC) Katja says, "That's something I can set my Muse to do while I EVA, right?"

"We haven't looked very hard," Remus replies. "He could be anywhere. So If you're going to eject that pod, make sure he's not in it first."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Ethically speaking, is it 'ok' to jettison the last pod? o\_O I mean, what if it's just some other schlep like us."

> (OOC) Doc says, "you can ask your muse to do it, yeah. in that case:"

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 40 for 11 (critical success!)

> (OOC) Damon says, "Feel free to argue with Damon, Remus. You might even be able to convince him."

As Damon and Katja work to unhook the pod, the ship's systems come alive for them across the mesh: "Notice. Containment protocol still in effect. However, remaining hibernation subject is no longer showing signs of active infection."

> (OOC) Remus says, "No \_longer\_? You mean he \_was\_?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "ask ICly."

Remus says, "Wait. No longer? You mean he was before?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "keep in mind that this isn't just some recorded voice, you can interact with the ship and as it to clarify/explain"

Damon hesitates. "Remus. I don't want to kill an innocent person if it's convenient. Double-check the lifebot for me. Let me know if there's anything you need me to hook up to do it."

Katja says, "Ship, have you determined the nature of infection?"

"Pod sensors registered the presence of a subject infected with the exsurgent virus. Remus Greyrobe - you identified yourself as a qualified medical specialist. Please be aware that this subject may have the Watts-McLeod strain of the exsurgent virus. Infection diagnosis may therefore be insufficiently detailed."

Menocal says, "Wuzzat?"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Would Damon have heard of Watts-McLeod? Militaries would be very interested in weaponizing psi."

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 60 for 76 (failure, MoF 16)

> (OOC) Doc says, "totally negatory."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Menocal, while they are doin that, Katja's muse located Doc. you interested in retrieving him?"

"Ship, that question was directed at you," says Damon. "What's the exsurgent virus? What's the Watts-McLod strain?"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "Sure! I can go get Doc"

The ship begins reciting. "Exsurgent virus, Watts-McLeod strain. A variant on the TITAN exsurgent virus which modifies the transhuman brain, causing it to generate a modulated brainwave pattern that is extremely difficult to detect. Subjects affected by this strain are identified as 'asyncs', referencing the asynchronous nature of these brainwaves compared to baseline transhumanity. Subjects exhibit anomalous physical or psychological abilities but are not classified as an x-risk as individuals by Firewall at this time."

> (OOC) Doc says, "And the fact that the ship knows what the fuck Firewall is should tip you guys off, too."

> (OOC) Damon is going to leave those sort of sophisticated deductions to the eggheads of the group n.n

Following a lead relayed to her by Katja's Muse, Menocal heads belowdecks. In the spacious cargo area, she finds a blinking ecto that's been affixed to one of the walls. It seems to be the source of Doc's transmissions.

"Put simply," Remus adds, "The infected often develop fairy-tale style mental powers. Mind-reading and the like. Not that that's necessarily better than atomically rebuilt killing machines. But it seems strange to me that this one fellow would have that strain when all the others had a more radical effect." He narrows his eyes. "Also strange that the ship is using FIrewall's jargon at us. Care to elabortate, ship?"

Katja frowns. "Ship, do you have the Firewall mission parameter for this team?" She doesn't really care about the virus if it isn't going to kill them.

Menocal pokes the echo, in an attempt to get Doc out.

"Personnel files have finished their repairs," the ship announces. "You have been positively identified as Firewall personnel, with a 99.9% certainty. This vessel is owned and operated by Firewall personnel."

"There is no active mission on record, and several hours of logs are unavailable. However, it is most likely that the previous crew were in hibernation with you. The remaining pod most likely contains the only surviving member of the original crew."

"Then I move that we don't throw him out just yet," Remus says. "A Watts-McLeod survivor is just the kind of person Firewall would recruit, so he's no more dangerous than the rest of us. Also..." Remus puases. "If we thaw him out, he might be able to tell us how the hell we got here."

Katja says, "There's an idea.""

> (OOC) Katja says, "Can we float the whole pod back in through the airlock, or do we have to take him out first?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "the airlocks are pretty big, you can fit the pod in through either side"

"Agreed," says Damon. "We'll leave him here for now. Pod will keep him on ice, and he won't need to use our air. Let's figure out where our next breath is coming from."

> (OOC) Menocal rolls 1d100 vs. 60 for 27 (exceptional success, MoS 33)

Menocal tries to hack Doc out of his freezer.

Katja says, "Really? It won't take me that long to get life support back up."

Menocal's tinkering with the safeguards in the ecto's software start to yield fruit. Faster than expected, too - and in time, she realizes why. These are exactly the sorts of safeguards she would put in place, were she trying to seal Doc away.

Remus pushes off towards the biolab. "We were doing pretty well with the algae farm. Katja, you're welcome to come and critique the cuisine; I apologize in advance."

Menocal says, "Oh, things I do not liiiike."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Does that mean that you were the one locking him up in the first place?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "that seems indicated"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "thus my comment."

"What is it, Menocal?" Damon calls out over the mesh. "Something wrong with Doc?"

Menocal says, "noooo.. uh. If we came up on a lock, and we tried to get through it, and I said "oh wait, I made this lock, I have the key", would you be suspicirous?"

"I take it this isn't a, what do you say, thought experiment, Menocal," replies Damon grimly. "See if you can find out why."

Menocal says, "No, the man in the icebox is the one with expermental thinking. I will see if I can read the history buffer."

> (OOC) Menocal rolls 1d100 vs. 65 for 69 (failure, MoF 4)

Menocal reads the buffer to see if she left herself a note.

> (OOC) Doc takes over

There is a message - a short one, audio-visual only. It's Menocal, with the ship in scene behind her. The point of view must be the ecto itself.

> (OOC) Doc says, "more"

"If you get this, I apologize for the lack. You will be rolled back very far," she's saying. "We were infected. Our egos are to be erased. So we are suiciding before it goes too far." The on-screen Menocal shudders. "Already still I feel the change, taking myself over. We are going to destroy the infection in the ship. I hope you survive."

> (OOC) Doc says, "go ahead"

Menocal says, "....ohboy. We're backups, sort of. we were **infected**, we rolled back and put in place, and then kaboomed."

> (OOC) Doc says, "in that case, you would guess that Doc was isolated to keep him safe from you guys purging the ship. But that's just a guess. Ultimately, you guys must decide who or what you trust, and act on that."

> (OOC) Remus was catching SIGWIFE. Backscrolls.

> (OOC) Doc says, "I the GM have no further advice for you. let the pod patient out, or space him; let Doc out, or keep him trapped, or space him too. Do what is right for you guys in character."

> (OOC) Doc says, "This is the crucible in which Firewall agents are tested."

Katja is still for a moment. "Ship, can you detect the infection that was contained in anyone left on the ship, even if it is dormant?

"Not without a medical examination," the ship answers. "Please take any test subjects to the sick-bay. Hibernation pods are also equipped with medical sensors, optimized for measurement of subject in stasis, and may not give adequately detailed results."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Wait. Is this not my original sleeve?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Remus has never re-sleeved. c\_c"

> (OOC) Doc says, "it feels like your original. You'd guess they flushed the brain structure, and just totally remapped your brain to a backup."

> (OOC) Doc says, "of course, you could be wrong...."

Katja says, "Remus? Can you verify if there is still infection present in us?"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "...ship, were readings taken of all of us when we boarded?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "is that meant to be IC?"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "oops. yes"

Menocal says, "ship, were readings taken of all of us when we boarded?"

"Physiological data and personnel records are available," the ship answers. "However, comprehensive medical records are not up to date. It appears that large segments of data were deliberately destroyed - the repair programs in main memory have stalled and retries are failing."

Menocal says, "n3trz. no way to check Doc, then."

Remus thinks this over. "I can try. But... it seems unlikely to me that there'd be a trojan horse in Doc. If the bug was that vicious, we probably wouldn't have been able to manage a purge." Remus shudders involuntarily. "And it adequately explains what happened to the other three. So I'll give it a go, but the null hypothesis is that Doc is safe."

> (OOC) Doc says, "alright. checking people out via sickbay?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "You can take that as a statement of intent. Using whatever tools are left in the biolab, I'll scan us for traces of unidentified nanotech or biological agents. And I also want to see how old these sleeves are."

Menocal says, "OK, gonna break Doc out, then."

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. Sleeves check out okay. No lingering signs of anomalous biological or nanotechnological elements - your implants are there and functioning, but nothing weird."

> (OOC) Doc says, "the infection that was mentioned sounds like it was brain-based"

Katja turns to Damon. "We can push the whole pod to the airlock. Keep him all snug in the pod until we're ready to wake him."

> (OOC) Remus says, "The whole story is more credible if these are our original meats. Also, more scary, because it indicates that the exsurgent virus is as much a mental phenomenon as anything."

> (OOC) Remus says, "I mean, it might construct the physical vector in response to... ugh. It makes my brain meats hurt to even think about it."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Shall I pose the medical exam?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "please do"

Damon nods to Katja. "Let's do it. Might as well save us a step later," he says, taking his end of the pod once Katja finishes unshipping it.

Katja lifts and glides back to the airlock with Damon and the pod.

Remus rotates the crew through various tests in the sick bay - starting with himself. As far as he can tell - and he'd know - everyone is clear of infection, and still in the same bodies as when they first met on Wilhab. Which makes it worse, somehow; losing a fork is one thing, but losing the original is frightening, especially when it's _you_. Remus indulges in a tranquilizer before passing the results on. "We're clean," he says. "Which means that whatever happened to us, either it was purely mental, or we managed to flush all the physical vectors. Damned if I know which. But my recommendation stands - let Doc out, but keep our mystery man on ice for now."

Menocal turns to the task of breaking Doc out. Which should be easy. She did it, after all.

Fiddler's Green pings the crew for permission to access their AR. A moment later, Doc flickers into existence in the sickbay. He dusts himself off, adjusts the fit and sleeves of his clothes a bit, and beams. "So grateful for your assistance," he says with a low bow. "It is good to be here again."

> (OOC) Doc says, "we're about to close. any other business you guys want to get done tonight? If not, I will wrap up"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Try to solve our air problem. That seemed to be on course before."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Yeah, I just want Kat to get back to repairs after the check-up."

> (OOC) Doc says, "no problem, that'll be the close"

Katja says, "Well, this has been very exciting, but there are systems waiting for my deft touch. I've got to find an access to the life support systems to reroute power.""

> (OOC) Doc says, "alright then. closing:"

Menocal says, "Breathing is good!"

Katja says, "Yes. I'd like to continue it as well." She grins and walks off looking for an access panel."

Remus manages a good biological scrubber for the air, while Katja's work on life support ensures power. The makers that would normally be scrubbing the atmosphere were demolished as part of the purge of the ship, so this lower-tech substitute will have to make do until the ship can get back to its berth. If there was an exsurgent infection aboard ship, it's no wonder that any nanotech factories were taken out of commission.

The engines themselves are fueled, with enough delta-V to reach some port in the system sooner or later. The crew may need to go into hibernation again, but some assists from the solar system's 'gravity highway' might help. Studying the schematics more closely, Katja finds that the ship was once the _Ilya Muromets_, refactored by Firewall into a ship for its agents and redubbed the _Alexander Nevsky_ - both great heroes of Russian history. Perhaps with such a heroic lineage, it may protect their lives on the way back to civilization.
