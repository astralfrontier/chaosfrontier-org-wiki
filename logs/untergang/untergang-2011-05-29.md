> (OOC) Doc also has setup

The _Nevsky_ is accelerating towards Saturn's outermost habitats - and for those who have opted to stay out of the hibernation pods, simulspaces are more comfortable than living through 3 G's of burn. Doc of course has no choice. He's spent his time decorating his virtual home in the ship's computers, and always welcomes visitors.

> (OOC) Damon says, "more? or should I pose in?"

Damon is definitely not the 'decorating' sort, himself. To call his own personal space 'spartan' would be an affront to the artwork of the ancient nearly-forgotten warrior nation of that name. In times like these, when he isn't in a training sim - and even Damon can't be training _all_ the time - Damon generally finds himself visiting other people's sims. Doc's is a favorite - well-designed, and nowhere near as surreal as the space Menocal calls home.

On this occasion, Damon is reminded of something that he's been pondering for some time. "Doc... got a personal question for you if you don't mind." He pauses for a moment of thought. "How long have you been living as an infomorph?"

Doc stops shelving the books he's been working on. It's an odd thing to do. Why move anything around in this place? "All my adult life," he replies with a smile. "I was uploaded as a teenager in Beijing, I believe. Before that.. well. There are certain gaps in my memory, but I am quite sure I've been an infomorph since the Fall."

Damon nods. "And in all that time, have you ever thought of saving up for a sleeve?"

Doc laughs. "I see you haven't delved into my profile, Mr. Damon." He pulls another book from the half-stocked shelf and begins flipping pages. Finding the spot he wants, he adjusts his spectacles and begins reading. "Glitch. Neptunian habitat. Population: 20,000 transhumans." Looking up, he grins. "The whole structure is a few dozen meters in diameter. Of those people, perhaps 2,000 are exiled Chinese dissidents, like myself. It's an entirely virtual community. We use robotics, of course, and I have jammed several shells that might qualify as a 'synthmorph' in quality, but.. "

"Neptune is not a place where one lives as a biomorph. Those who own physical bodies in the outer system are the truly mad."

Damon's first reaction is just a bewildered "Huh," as he sinks into a chair, looking up at the virtual ceiling. It's several minutes before he speaks again. "So... uh... why live like that? I mean, uh..."

Doc gestures around him. "Even with nanotechnology, you cannot fabricate everything you could possibly want. A virtual existence provides the ideal environment for comfort, personal aesthetics, and cultivation of the self. Even in this half-destroyed ship, I am able to pursue my interests."

"Well, I guess that's lucky for you, then," Damon says. "What I do... well, the best I can do in a simulspace is train. Infospace has military _implications_ - intelligence always has. But you can't hold ground when there's no ground to hold."

> (OOC) Damon says, "Damon's question has been answered, in fact, and sooner or later he will realize this."

The scientist smiles again. "Well. I would argue that robotic weapons are in fact superior to anything but a highly-optimized Ultimate morph or something similar. Remote operation will always be a safer prospect than direct involvement, but not always feasible. However, there is another factor: information density and self-repair. This is a computer science question but may have military implications."

"I've tried a few war synthmorphs," Damon says, trying to follow the conversation. "The Ultimate I use these days is more versatile. And... well, to be honest, a synth just isn't the same. It feels more like I'm just piloting a vehicle, know what I mean?"

Doc clasps his hands together. "That's fair, and there's value to your approach as well. Consider a typical biomorph. We'll say a flat, no modifications to the brain or other systems. Provide it an information density of N - some arbitrary number of bits per cubic centimeter. While this may be inefficient, it's also quite fault-tolerant against random damage. For systems with information density values of 100N, the same injury will inflict 100 times as much damage to the underlying information. A bullet that can kill one physical brain could kill a hundred virtual ones, in other words. That very inefficiency makes you much more able to sustain damage."

"Or to put it another way, the same shell that'll kill a few dozen people if it hulls Wilhab could kill thousands on Glitch," Damon says.

Doc nods soberly. "That is why combat programmers such as myself were in such demand," he explains. "We were forced to take a more, hmm, pro-active posture against threats than some of our membership would have liked. A single rock could easily destroy the whole habitat, if aimed properly."

Damon seems a little more satisfied. "I get it, though. I guess if you're okay with sitting around and thinking, you don't need a body for that. Not really my kind of thing, but if it works for you..." He shrugs.

Doc grins again. "Let us say, then: an infomorph for life in times of peace, a physical sleeve in times of war, and a recognition that both are necessary in turbulent times."

Damon laughs. "Well, Doc, don't forget that some of us really aren't cut out for the bodiless life. Then again... history says that there's always a war somewhere. I'm kind of counting on that, in fact."

Doc's smile fades again. "Yes, well. History does suggest that our species is not suited for tranquility. If we cannot have peace, all we can hope for is that our warriors are honorable sorts."

"Well, you can't count on _all_ warriors being honorable sorts," Damon says gravely. "But you can count on me."
