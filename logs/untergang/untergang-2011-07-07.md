> (OOC) Doc says, "From round to round, we'll be rolling initiative. Your init score is given in brackets."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Deck plans for your ship: http://pandoraslair.org/sites/default/files/AlexanderNevsky.png"

> (OOC) Doc says, "per last time's description, Damon and Katja are in the 'access corridor' on the topmost deck, while their opponents are boarding through the starboard airlock. Remus can place himself where he wishes."

> (OOC) Doc says, "if that is not correct, correct me now."

> (OOC) Katja says, "I thought they were coming in through a big hole."

> (OOC) Doc says, "the attackers broke into two groups: a bunch of robots, and 2 live+2 robots. the robot group came in through the big hole and fell into your magnet trap."

> (OOC) Doc says, "that leaves the others."

> (OOC) Remus says, "I would be whereever is best protected. At this point that might be the cockpit."

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay then. Damon, Katja, any further questions/corrections on placement?"

> (OOC) Katja says, "I don't think we ever actually talked about how we were going to do this. o.o;"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Just range."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Why would be a deck below where they're entering the ship?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "What?"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Pretty sure we're at the topmost deck access corridor, next to crew hibernation."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Correct"

> (OOC) Katja says, "You said we were on the top deck. I'm just pointing out that the cockpit is mid deck."

> (OOC) Doc says, "It is. what about it?"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Yes. That's where Remus is. They have to go all the way through to the biolab to go down, or else punch through the floor."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Oh. I misread that. I'm so sorry. Ok. x.x"

> (OOC) Doc says, "this is where Skype comes in handy ;)"

> (OOC) Doc says, "anyway: range will be Short (0-10m) in virtually every corridor of the ship, the long access corridors being the exception"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Noted. I'll ask more as we go."

Firewall SITREP: Personnel from the Borderland refueling station are boarding the _Nevsky_. Sentinels are defending. More to follow.

---

> (OOC) Doc says, "damon, you've got an action. Your attackers are cycling their way through the airlock - you guys only noticed they were packing weapons at the last moment, before they started boarding. So you don't have a clear shot yet, but you can (for example) ready grenades or do something else."

> (OOC) Doc says, "(you could also attempt to shoot through the bulkhead of your airlock...)"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Huh. For some reason I neglected grenades in my equipment list."

> (OOC) Damon says, "I have no idea what to do."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Do we have anything that qualifies as a 'seeker weapon'?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "recommendation: Aim (complex action), for a +30 to your next shot"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Sounds good."

> (OOC) Doc says, "k. Katja, your action?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "just declare what you have in mind OOCly."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Concussion genade. Can I throw it to stick on the wall a few feet from where the enemy will emerge? I can remote detonate from this range."

> (OOC) Doc says, "yes."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Shall I pose it?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "goferit"

Damon murmurs over the tacnet, "First priority is repel boarders, second is take living alive." As the airlock cycles open, his smartlink shows the trajectory of the SMG aiming through the widening gap.

Katja tosses a sticky concussion grenade at the wall near the access to the corridor to give the intruders a nice suprise.

> (OOC) Doc says, "Menocal cowers. Remus?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "For what it is worth, I will try to back Doc up on ECM duty. If the drones don't have forks in them they may be easier to subvert, and if we can appropriate them we'll add to our firepower."

Katja says, "Roger that."

Inside the airlock, the attackers are cycling the inner door. In a few seconds they'll be emerging.

> (OOC) Remus says, "I'm trying to work out a way to persuade them not to kill us, but I think this first skirmish is inevitable. If we show some spine maybe we can convince them to back off."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Is To Hit going to be weapon skill + any smartlink bonus? Or is that a seperate roll?"

"Engaging tactical network," comes Doc's cheerful voice. A new set of icons and data spring to life in the crew's augmented reality: live video feeds from their fellows, ammo counts, projected locations of their attackers. Cameras inside the airlock are automatically fed in, extrapolated; through the suddenly transparent airlock bulkhead, Damon and Katja can see the vague outlines of four figures fiddling with the controls.

> (OOC) Doc says, "it's weapon skill plus bonus yes."

> (OOC) Doc announces the next round! \*\* Initiative order: Katja \[181\], Menocal \[167\], Remus \[156\], Drone2 \[153\], Damon \[145\], Drone1 \[119\], Live2 \[106\], Doc \[92\], Live1 \[73\] \*\*

> (OOC) Katja says, "If they're not through yet, then aim."

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. Remus?"

> (OOC) Remus hmm

> (OOC) Remus says, "So can I actually do anything, along the lines I just mentioned?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "sure. But in general those guys are pretty well handled. Katja put together a good trap"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Then I guess I have to watch and pray. For what it's worth, I'll put my eyes on the tactical data and see if I can figure out their objectives."

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay."

Inside the airlock, one of the synths extracts and readies a grenade-shaped object from the 'repair kit' each of the attackers brought. The others are already armed with SMGs.

> (OOC) Doc says, "Damon?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "getting out of the access corridor might be wise, if they are prepping a grenade."

> (OOC) Damon says, "True. But questions: How would I estimate my odds of penetrating the airlock bulkhead with an AP SMG (modifier -7)? and if it is feasible, how easy is it to repair the resulting hole?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "the bulkhead will probably have a very high durability, but an armor value of (you'd guess) 15-25 - about as tough as heavy synth armor. repair should be no worse than everything else in this busted up ship, and you have 3 other airlocks to fall back on"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Not good enough odds for what I have in mind. Call out on tacnet and retreat."

_'nade! Fall back!_ snaps Damon on the tacnet, abandoning his cover and retreating for the hibernation chamber.

The airlock door cycles open. Nobody rushes through just yet - the attackers have a 'care package' of their own to throw first.

> (OOC) Doc announces the next round! \*\* Initiative order: Damon \[174\], Drone1 \[159\], Menocal \[154\], Remus \[140\], Live1 \[128\], Live2 \[122\], Katja \[112\], Doc \[77\], Drone2 \[67\] \*\*

> (OOC) Doc says, "You can get to cover and resume your Aim this turn, Damon"

> (OOC) Menocal has connected.

> (OOC) Damon says, "Doing so."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Menocal, we're in combat. attackers are working their way through the airlock. so far I've had you cowering in some unspecified part of the ship, like the cockpit (where Remus is). You're free to position yourself, though."

> (OOC) Doc says, "you also have a combat action, if you're doing anything. just OOCly declare"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "I'm going to try to hack their comm net destructively - I might not be able to read it, but I might be able to make a lot of noise in it to lower their efficiency. (also Menocal lacks combat experience and may not know this is not really all that possible, if it is not.)"

> (OOC) Doc says, "this is a Jamming action, so roll Interfacing"

> (OOC) Menocal rolls 1d100 vs. 55 for 90 (exceptional failure, MoF 35)

> (OOC) Doc says, "no soap this round, but you can try again next time. Remus?"

> (OOC) Menocal blows her own head up x.x

> (OOC) Doc says, "(reminder: you can spend Moxie to reverse the rolls you guys make. Moxie will refresh after this session)"

> (OOC) Remus is a lot worse at Interfacing than Menocal

> (OOC) Menocal hm. "If I spend the Moxie it'll make it a great success; I will do so.

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. pose doin so"

> (OOC) Damon says, "This was a triumph."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Unchanged. Short of dialing the station and trying to talk them out of kicking our asses, I'll stick to the role of spectator. So far I haven't seen anything that gives me a hint about what they are up to besides piracy."

Menocal taps into the communication's network, finding the frequencies that the attackers are on. She takes a moment to gauge its strength and speed, not trying to get the encryption at all. Instead, she drops in an old song she has. It may not do much with the communications, but someone may find they have "The Song That Never Ends" stuck in their processors.

> (OOC) Doc says, "you'd guess that they ARE up to piracy"

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. Katja is up. you're still (by my count) in the access corridor, where a grenade is about to show up, and you can also move to cover if you want"

> (OOC) Katja says, "You said that the door is open now?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "Yeah. so you can do something about that instead, if you want"

> (OOC) Doc says, "but if so, you will be here for whatever they throw."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Can I move to cover and detonate my grenade? Or is that too much?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "you could, but it's too early to set it off - nobody has come through yet, and the concussion won't wrap around walls"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Meh, good point. Ok, I'll move to cover."

> (OOC) Doc will cover that in pose:

As Katja follows Damon into the crew hibernation room, the pirates toss their own grenade into the room. Abruptly the chamber fills itself with a hot, inky black smoke. The sound of weapons priming to fire is heard. It looks like they planned to shoot into the smoke, not counting on having their actions monitored.

> (OOC) Doc announces the next round! \*\* Initiative order: Katja \[178\], Remus \[172\], Live2 \[141\], Damon \[128\], Doc \[113\], Menocal \[95\], Drone2 \[64\], Live1 \[63\], Drone1 \[62\] \*\*

> (OOC) Doc says, "this is a good time to Aim, Kat. +30 to your next shot"

> (OOC) Remus says, "That sounds like inexpert tactics. Surely they'd know that we'd see a grenade coming."

> (OOC) Doc says, "it is inexpert."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Yeah, if they're still hiding outside the corridor like sissies, then I will aim."

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. Remus, still monitoring?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Yes."

The first of the two synths emerges from the airlock and into the smoke, wildly firing its SMG into the corridor. It's not trying to hit anything specific - just whatever might have been foolish enough to remain behind.

> (OOC) Remus says, "But if they keep this up, I may dial the station and try insulting them."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Damon, your shot. if you have t-ray vision or something similar, you can see through the smoke."

> (OOC) Damon says, "I do indeed have T-Ray vision and emitter. Do they have any T-Ray emitters?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "negatory"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Called shot to the right arm."

> (OOC) Doc says, "roll em"

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 20 for 57 (exceptional failure, MoF 37)

> (OOC) Damon says, "Smartlink +10, called shot -10, aim +30. that gives me a total of 100, whoat do I roll?"

> (OOC) Damon says, "actually, cover for -10."

> (OOC) Doc says, "'roll on 100'. all you gotta do is avoid a critical failure (00)"

> (OOC) Damon says, " 60 or better I hit the arm, 61-90 I hit normally."

> (OOC) Damon rolls 1d100 vs. 90 for 23 (exceptional success, MoS 67)

> (OOC) Doc says, "do your damage. its armor rating is 12, so apply any AP you have."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Snap."

> (OOC) Damon says, "so that's (2d10+3) - (12-7)?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "sounds right"

> (OOC) Damon rolls 2d10-2 for 11 (7 6 -2)

> (OOC) Doc says, "that's enough to score a wound, good job. it drops its weapon."

> (OOC) Doc says, "pose accordingly. Menocal, continuing jamming?"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "yes"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "reroll?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "you're being opposed, so yes:"

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 40 for 53 (failure, MoF 13)

> (OOC) Menocal rolls 1d100 vs. 55 for 66 (critical failure!)

> (OOC) Menocal explodes

> (OOC) Doc says, "they didn't succeed either, so the jamming stands for now."

_Superior technology for the win,_ thinks Damon - the smoke totally obscures normal vision, but has no effect on t-rays. His weapon is already trained on the enemy, and a brief burst of SMG return fire is enough to strike the enemy's arm, forcing him to drop his own weapon.

Confusion among the enemy is visible and rampant. The other three stumble into the smoke, aiming for where the door to the hibernation chamber ought to be, and open fire. But it's not the accurate spread of three units in close coordination; instead it's catch as catch can.

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 40 for 46 (failure, MoF 6)

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 40 for 91 (exceptional failure, MoF 51)

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 40 for 7 (exceptional success, MoS 33)

> (OOC) Doc says, "Damon, roll your Fray/2"

> (OOC) Damon rolls 1d100 vs. 35 for 64 (failure, MoF 29)

> (OOC) Doc says, "your physical armor?"

> (OOC) Damon says, "13 vs. kinetic."

> (OOC) Doc rolls 2d6-3 for 5 (3 5 -3)

> (OOC) Doc says, "that won't wound, but you'll take 5 durability."

> (OOC) Damon says, "35/40, if I count correclty."

> (OOC) Doc announces the next round! \*\* Initiative order: Doc \[151\], Live1 \[140\], Katja \[125\], Damon \[118\], Live2 \[117\], Drone2 \[115\], Drone1 \[97\], Remus \[87\], Menocal \[85\] \*\*

> (OOC) Remus says, "All the way to the back of the bus."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Katja, you'll be able to trigger your grenade as a quick action this round, in addition to shooting."

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 40 for 75 (exceptional failure, MoF 35)

> (OOC) Katja says, "Yay!"

More shooting follows, and Damon finds himself clipped by a lucky shot. His vitals monitoring responds immediately: Superficial Damage Detected, Blood Clotting Commencing. But by and large, the smoke isn't much better for the pirates than for the sentinels.

> (OOC) Doc says, "Katja is up."

> (OOC) Katja says, "I have a T-Ray emitter, as well. Between that and the tac net, are we able to determine which is robot and which is living?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "easily"

> (OOC) Katja says, "And was it a living one or a robot that threw the grenade?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "synth"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Ok. Burst at closest synth. I'm looking at 60 +10 smartlink -10 cover +30 aim? So, 90?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "yeah. the airlock corridor is a kill zone, just like it was meant to be"

> (OOC) Katja rolls 1d100 vs. 90 for 28 (exceptional success, MoS 62)

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 20 for 25 (failure, MoF 5)

> (OOC) Remus says, "You rock. o\_o"

> (OOC) Doc says, "hit, do your damage. synth armor is 12."

> (OOC) Katja says, "AP is 11, so (2d10 + 8 + 1d10) - (12-11)."

> (OOC) Katja rolls 3d10+7 for 28 (8 5 8 7)

> (OOC) Doc says, "that'll inflict a few wounds, good shot."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Sweet. And then I activate the grenade! :D"

> (OOC) Doc says, "oh hey. Damon, Kat, what are you guys shooting? SMGs?"

> (OOC) Damon is packin SMG with AP ammo.

> (OOC) Katja says, "Auto Rifle for me, using AP rounds."

> (OOC) Doc says, "I dunno if you guys twigged to this. Do you want to be firing bursts or full-auto rather than single shot?"

> (OOC) Doc does the combat demo dance here :)

> (OOC) Damon says, "Katja called burst, I'll do the same this round."

> (OOC) Katja says, "I'm doing burst. Which makes me ask, did that count as one or two shots? Because I get two. o.o;"

> (OOC) Doc says, "you get to make your second attack, so go ahead with that."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Do I lose the aim bonus for second shot?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "'as long as the target remains in your sights until the next action phase', so you keep the bonus"

> (OOC) Katja rolls 1d100 vs. 90 for 15 (exceptional success, MoS 75)

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 20 for 1 (success, MoS 19)

> (OOC) Doc says, "because it's an opposed roll, you still win :D roll damage"

> (OOC) Katja rolls 3d10+7 for 28 (6 5 10 7)

> (OOC) Doc says, "That will decisively take it out. pose accordingly"

> (OOC) Katja says, "That has to hurt."

> (OOC) Doc says, "while that's goin on, Damon, hit it"

> (OOC) Damon says, "So how many actions of what type am I allowed to take?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "you get a complex action in your turn, along with 3 quick actions."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Oh, I still need to do the grenade."

> (OOC) Doc says, "or you can forego your complex action for 9-12 quick ones."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Ah yeah, no roll there, just the effect"

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 60 for 5 (exceptional success, MoS 55)

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 60 for 61 (failure, MoF 1)

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 60 for 25 (exceptional success, MoS 35)

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 40 for 98 (exceptional failure, MoF 58)

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 40 for 37 (success, MoS 3)

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 40 for 90 (exceptional failure, MoF 50)

> (OOC) Doc says, "go ahead and pose the 'nade going off as well then"

Katja keeps a synth in her sights with a steady hand. She fires off two bursts directly at it, and grins when she sees it wobble. Then she activates the little present she left the group in the access corridor. The cuncussive blast shakes them up nicely.

> (OOC) Damon says, "Quick Action: aim at the other synth, then two bursts."

> (OOC) Damon rolls 1d100 vs. 80 for 71 (success, MoS 9)

In zero gravity, concussion grenades are interesting objects indeed. Experienced spacers with plenty of space can reorient themselves as they're blown around, but there's no room to maneuver. The three remaining pirates bounce around like pinballs.

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 30 for 38 (failure, MoF 8)

> (OOC) Doc says, "hit. I gave him +10 to dodge just for random movement, but you still pegged him. synth armor is 12."

> (OOC) Remus says, "How many did they start with, 5 synths and 2 squishies?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "2 living people in vacc suits, 2 synths that came through the airlock. 8 other robots through the hole in your hull, currently being fried."

> (OOC) Damon rolls 3d10-4 for 9 (5 4 4 -4)

> (OOC) Damon says, "second shot."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Don't forget that if you use burst on a single target, you get +1d10 to DV. ;)"

> (OOC) Damon says, "that's in there."

> (OOC) Damon rolls 1d100 vs. 80 for 58 (success, MoS 22)

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 30 for 2 (success, MoS 28)

> (OOC) Doc says, "you hit"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Huh. I feel better about my rifle now."

> (OOC) Damon rolls 3d10-4 for 15 (10 4 5 -4)

> (OOC) Damon has gun envy n.n

> (OOC) Doc says, "that'll deliver a couple more wounds, so it's not going to be much good at anything - you've effectively disabled it"

> (OOC) Doc says, "You guys gonna push for surrender, or kill the two biomorphs?"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Push for surrender."

> (OOC) Katja says, "We can use them to barter if they're still breathing."

> (OOC) Doc says, "talk is a free action"

> (OOC) Remus says, "We'll see if they do or they don't. c\_c And then call the station back in either case."

As the enemy goes flying, Damon draws a bead on the other synth and opens fire again, perforating the machine with a well-placed cluster of bullets. "Boarders! You are overmatched!" he calls, through the smoke. "Lay down your weapons!"

> (OOC) Damon will happily attempt an Intimidation roll if called for.

A moment later, a pair of SMGs come floating out of the smoke - thrown by their former holders, as Damon can clearly see. And the two biomorphs are carefully floating out as well. The surrender seems to have been accepted.

> (OOC) Doc says, "assuming you don't shoot...."

> (OOC) Damon does not. It'll suffice to restrain and search.

One of them slides an armored visor up. Behind it, Damon and Kat can see the face of Mickey Sullivan, one of the proprietors of Borderland. "Never let it be said that a Sullivan did a man dirty. More 'n once," he grins.

> (OOC) Doc says, "pose your search/restraint"

> (OOC) Remus says, "... well. Didn't see that coming."

> (OOC) Remus says, "is one of the artficials Everybody Else?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "not that you guys can see, once the smoke clears"

Katja turns to Damon and smiles. "That was fun. I've got some rope with me for these clowns."

> (OOC) Katja says, "GAH. Damon. x.x"

> (OOC) Doc says, "don't panic, just changeline ;)"

> (OOC) Remus says, "After we've got the boarders secu8re, I'll see if we can get Everybody Else on the radio."

> (OOC) Katja says, "How does that work again?"

Damon grins back. "Leading from the front. I'm impressed," he says. "Katja, cover them, I make sure there's no more surprises." Addressing Mickey and his companion again: "If you could dismount, my friends? You are overdressed for prisoners."

> (OOC) Damon fixes.

Mickey starts removing his vacc suit, as ordered; his kit is already well out of reach. "I've decided that I like you fellows, and I'll make ye a counter-offer to what you were proposin'," he announces.

Katja keeps the humans in her sights.

> (OOC) Doc says, "Remus and Menocal are party to all of this, courtesy of the tacnet."

> (OOC) Remus says, "I want to hear his counter-offer."

When he isn't immediately gunned down for impertinence, Sullivan continues. "You seem a crew of likely lads. All jumped up, with yer guns and yer fancy bloody grenades. Nice one, that. Escort a block of ah, legally questionable software to Rhea for me and I'll not only fuel ye, I'll pass along our note of credit so that ye can repair this pile of scrap and spruce it up a might too. What say ye?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "What is Rhea? Isn't that one of the bigger asteroids?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "second-largest moon of Saturn."

> (OOC) Remus says, "What the hell. z\_z He said the magic words: 'We get paid'."

Katja hmm's into the tacnet. "Menocal? Have you pulled something like that before? How difficult would it be?"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "would that be programming, infosec, or academics: CS? o.o"

> (OOC) Doc says, "the art of software smuggling is properly its own professional skill, but to cover evidence of such things would be Infosec, with Academics: CS as a complementary skill"

> (OOC) Doc says, "Generally any crime-related skills might have some application"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "first roll academics, second infosec."

> (OOC) Menocal rolls 1d100 vs. 65 for 77 (critical failure!)

> (OOC) Menocal rolls 1d100 vs. 65 for 76 (failure, MoF 11)

> (OOC) Remus says, "Generally speaking, I'm in favor. Any opposed?"

> (OOC) Remus thinks that needs Moxie. .\_.;;

> (OOC) Doc says, "just to know that you can do it doesn't take a roll. doing it would."

> (OOC) Menocal says, "ah ok."

> (OOC) Damon says, "Damon only wants to know how much trouble we'd be likely to get into."

> (OOC) Doc says, "depends on the cargo"

Menocal ponders for a moment. "It depends on the security at Rhea. I've never been there, so I don't know it, but we're capable people. We can also examine it and determine if it might be of greater interest to our Other Friends, you know? They might not want it getting about. Until we see it I can't tell you how dangerous it might be, really. It could be a weird UX, it could be, uh, the really bad stuff again.

Menocal does not want to even mention what got us here in the first place out loud.

Katja asks Mickey directly, then. "How dangerous is this stuff to the carrier?"

Sullivan waves his hands rapidly. "Not in the slightest, me lovely! It's just data, baked into high-resolution storage. That's all. Hasn't given us a hint of grief."

"As I would prefer to put it," says Damon, resting against the far wall, "who questions its legality, and how badly would they like the wrong answer? I like to know how much trouble I can get into before I can get into it." He points at an unoccupied bulkhead, squinting along his fingertip as if sighting along a pistol barrel.

Katja speaks into the encrypted channel. "Well. It's probably the best offer we could get out here. I vote for taking it. If it goes bad, I also vote for coming back here and shutting this guy down. Permanently.

"Nary a worry, good sir," asserts Sullivan. "Folks around Saturn often use the Whale for smuggling. Nobody peeks inside except us prole technicians, you understand. If it were hot, we'd not touch it. We prefer harmless fun, like today's exchange of pleasantries."

> (OOC) Katja says, "How are you supposed to get line numbers?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "viewlast #20 (or #50 or whatever, the # means to show line numbers)"

Katja laughs out loud.

> (OOC) Damon says, "lastline gives you the last line number, bearing in mind that it counts OOC lines."

Remus is still waiting in the cockpit, drumming his fingers on the arm of his chair. "It can't really compare to the problems we had getting here. And while Mister Sullivan has a funny idea of what makes a good first date, I'm sure he can read a bottom line as well as anyone else. I'm with Katja."

Damon is similarly amused. "I like your sense of fun, Mister Sullivan," he grins. "_I am game as well,_" he adds over the tacnet. "_So that makes it unanimous?_"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Doc?"

"I suppose it can't be helped," remarks Doc. "We need fuel, and these are certainly easy terms. We'd best be gone before interested parties question too closely, however."

> (OOC) Doc says, "then unless someone dissents:"

With the cease-fire, Sullivan is once again able to contact Borderland. "Everyone Else, ahoy there. _Blessure grave_, my friends. Prepare for refueling!" Returning his attention to the crew, he rubs his hands together, adopting a mournful expression. "And these poor synthmorph shells. So badly damaged by passing pirates. We'll need to have Red River HQ send us some replacements again. Wirra, wirra."

"How many were damaged, please?" asks Everybody Else over the link. "Oh, five were shot to pieces," Sullivan replies sadly. "It's these outdated models. We'll need some of the new ones. The XM-3s. Be sure to specify. XM-3."

> (OOC) Doc says, "anything else you guys want to get done at the moment?"

> (OOC) Remus amends that to tacnet only.

Remus blinks. _That's what this was? A bloody insurancde scam? Anything else he wants us to accidentally ventilate?_ he thinks to the others.

> (OOC) Doc says, "If he'd won, he'd probably have kept your ship for real. If he loses, he'll try to cash in anyway."

Even Damon can count past two, and he can't help but snicker under his breath. "Yes it is true, you meet some rough sorts in the outer system, do you not," he says aloud. For the tacnet: "_They were not military grade, Remus. Cheap to replace, for a synthmorph._"

Katja snerks at Remus. "Welcome to the Saturn part of the system. This could have gone so much worse."

Everybody Else comes back on comms. "Fuel transfer is ready," the synth announces calmly. "We are glad you weren't hurt. Please maneuver to receive fuel and transfer cargo." A string of instructions for docking is passed to the _Nevsky_'s computer.

> (OOC) Remus says, "To be clear, is this a legit nav program, or will it, for example, crash us into them?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "it's legit."

> (OOC) Doc says, "'we are rotating at such and such a speed, our docking rings are at such and such a place along the hull' etc. The ship itself would move accordingly."

> (OOC) Katja says, "I'm just happy to be getting fuel. I'll be happy to release my trap once the fuel starts pumping. n.n"

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay then:"

With the last of its own fuel, /Nevsky _begins to spin, matching Borderland precisely. It locks onto the station, and Katja can see a display coming in. High-grade metallic hydrogen, kept under constant pressure, transferring itself into the crippled vessel's tanks block by block. Pressure stays constant, two orders of magnitude below the allowable error rate - everything looks good. And the station is signalling the transfer of cargo, roughly 3 meters by 3 meters by 3 meters in diameter. It's just a big block of mass storage by the look of it, with no radio or I_O.

Menocal says, "...that is a huge amount of data."

> (OOC) Doc says, "it really is."

> (OOC) Doc says, "anything else tonight?"

"Or a huge amount of shielding," Remus asks. "Who are we supposed to deliver to?"

> (OOC) Damon says, "NEver underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of hard drives."

> (OOC) Remus says, "It's gotta be xoxes. Uploaded people."

> (OOC) Doc says, "good guess."

> (OOC) Katja says, "I don't really want to know. I just want to get my ship fixed. Er, our ship."

"Just deliver it to the starport on Rhea," Sullivan explains. "Interested parties will be notified automatically, and it'll be held over for delivery. No need to arrange a cut-out or provide security. We like it that way."

Katja says, "Well, that's convenient."

> (OOC) Remus says, "In other words, we'll dock, and it will get confiscated."

> (OOC) Remus says, "We'll worry about that later."

> (OOC) Doc says, "You're basically delivering it COD."

> (OOC) Doc says, "last call! anything else you guys are doin tonight?"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Not a thing."

> (OOC) Menocal says, "nope"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Nope."

> (OOC) Doc says, "righto."

Cargo transfer completes. Sullivan and his robots get back to Borderland, after the crew verifies they have everything they need - not only to deliver the package, but more importantly, to get paid. The credit for this job will be considerable, assuming nothing goes wrong. Katja computes a course, and the _Nevsky_ undocks to seek its next port of call.
