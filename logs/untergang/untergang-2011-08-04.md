# Untergang 2011-08-04

> (OOC) Log "Untergang-2011-08-04" started by Doc at Thu Aug 4 21:10:34 2011 CDT (OOC)

Firewall SITREP: Crew has accepted a courier job of dubious legality in trade for ship repairs. The destination is Kronos Cluster. The dock there will have everything needed to repair the _Alexander Nevsky_. However, Kronos is advertised as a high-risk destination. More to follow.

---

Kronos Cluster is a habitat orbiting Saturn's moon Rhea. The most common association people have when looking at the station is a bunch of grapes; the station's administration took this to heart, and the narrow and winding space-dock of the station is nicknamed "the Vine".

Over 800,000 souls dwell on the station. Another 150,000 can be found clinging to an existence in tin cans, scum barges, improvised habitats and thoroughly patched life support bubbles in a swarm around the station proper. The habitat and its hangers-on form a network of neighborhoods, each mutually hostile, walled off from each other and dangerous to traverse alone. A group of Ultimates now run the Kronos Port Authority, or KPA, an Extropian hypercorp that the mercenaries muscled their way into once they got tired of being merely hired security.

The KPA enforces its rules, and all approaches to the habitat, with a series of satellites and autonomous weapons. A repeating radio beacon blares the station's rules and docking rates throughout nearby space; the KPA would rather have the money and the business of passing traders, but will settle for salvage rights if anyone is foolish enough to ignore their warnings.

---

Rhea is 527,000 km away from Saturn on a good day. With a full tank of fuel, the burn - coast - brake process will take only a week's time. The _Nevsky_ is still badly damaged, but Kronos' repair facilities are good. Risky, but good.

Katja reviews the manifest that came along with Sullivan's mysterious package. There's a heavily encrypted attachment, along with instructions: just dock, and the manifest will broadcast itself. Whoever has the matching key will arrive and take possession. There's an additional note: docking fees will be paid for by the recipient.

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. Katja, anything else you want to check out about this?"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Just a moment. o.o;"

> (OOC) Katja says, "No, nothing right now. Seems hostile, but functional."

Other messages have been routed to Kronos for delivery to the _Alexander Nevsky_'s crew. Among them, there's a note of congratulations from someone self-identifying as "Moebius Striptease": "Good work getting a deal from Mickey Sullivan. That girl can be a handful. Drop me a line if you ever need some work."

Private messages are coming in from the Eye, Firewall's VPN and social network. "Good job at Wilhab." "Pretty messy, but the job got done." "We heard what happened. Welcome back." Two of the more prominent messages catch the team's attention. The first is that their rescue party, the original owners of the _Nevsky_, are being resleeved and reassigned. Firewall is handing control over the ship to the revived team and wishes them well. The second is an anonymized note: "Some sentinels don't go back when they lack. Some do. If you go back to Wilhab, get some false ID. Your infomorph can do an ego edit to mask your signatures, you'll need it. Check with Ali Rashid on Phelan's for details about the situation on Wilhab. He can also get the forged records."

> (OOC) Doc says, "you guys have a week of transit time. doing anything of interest?"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Try building that weapon I was talking about a week or two ago."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Nanomachine net grenades?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "yep. you remember the stats we talked about?"

> (OOC) Remus has connected.

> (OOC) Katja says, "I saved it to a log."

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 80 for 58 (success, MoS 22)

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 50 for 60 (failure, MoF 10)

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 60 for 74 (failure, MoF 14)

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. Yu don't have anything like the parts required to fabricate it (no nanofabrication stuff survived), but you've got the plan for it. you can build it once you get a maker running"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Sweet."

> (OOC) Remus finished reading

> (OOC) Remus says, "So we've got some kind of communications again?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "sort of. your radio becomes stronger as you get closer, and the system-wide mesh is figuring out where to send messages to you."

> (OOC) Doc says, "remus, you've got a week of downtime. doing anything?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Some of our buying clout is predicated on the Coulam agreeing to using the /Nevsky/ to do sleeve deliveries. Do they agree to that?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "that's a separate deal you can work with the guys picking up the package. talk to them when you get there, since right now you don't know who it is."

> (OOC) Doc says, "or you can try to do a deal with someone else on the station in transit"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Hmm. I more meant whether or not the Coulam agree to it."

> (OOC) Doc says, "them? oh sure, that's what you were sent out to do"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Then we'll make some inquiries. Maybe it will make whoever is here less likely to screw us over if they know we're coming back with better loot next time."

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. we'll assume inquiries are sent out. most people who would take you up on that deal won't reply immediately, don't be surprised."

---

> (OOC) Remus says, "It's alright. Kind of has to be a 'coming soon' anyway."

As the ship approaches Kronos, alerts come online. They're being scanned by radar and laser from dozens of sources, on frequencies and in patterns normally reserved for weapons guidance. A stern voice comes on - probably the ship dock's automation. "Incoming vessels will follow transmitted trajectories or they will be considered hostile. For your safety and security, please abide by all Kronos Port Authority regulations."

> (OOC) Doc says, "proceeding with docking unless anyone has a mind to start some trouble."

> (OOC) Katja says, "That sould be suicidal."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Would."

There's a slight shiver as the ship makes contact with the station. The displays for outside environment flip from red to green, indicating good atmosphere. Katja notes the manifest, transmitting itself into the mesh. The owner of the package should be along shortly.

> (OOC) Remus says, "We should be ready for them. c\_c Which means Damon and Katja should be ready to MDK someone."

> (OOC) Katja says, "What are weapons rules where we're docking?"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Oh, and how long do we figure repairs to take?"

Katja asks the dock automation about weapons. The dock's systems reply immediately: "weapon use not authorized by the KPA or an acknowledged private protection service is against KPA policy. Violation can affect your docking rights."

> (OOC) Damon has connected.

Katja checks the estimated price of repairs against the letter for credit to check for any surplus.

Within twenty minutes, the ship is pinged. "This is Banana Grip. I'm the recipient of your cargo." The properly-decrypted manifest is transmitted as an attachment. The ship's own computer certifies it - this is the real deal.

Menocal sends a few messages when we get mesh; to (apparently) her parents, and to someone named "Voskov", both with highly sanitized versions (as in not mentioning Firewall, viruses... basically 'ship have some trouble, sorry I haven't called') of what's happened.

Menocal mouths, "Banana grip?" with a sort of boggly expression.

"Doc," Remus mutters. "What can we find out about this Banana Grip person?"

> (OOC) Remus amends that

"Is he going to get us shot by the KPA when they figure out what we're carrying?" Remus adds.

Katja says, "Obviously an alias. I say lets get the transfer over and the ship into a repair station."

"Not unless this was a very expensive setup for a bunch of nobodies," replies Doc cheerfully. "I agree, it's probably an alias, but I'll start looking."

Katja mutters. "Faster the better."

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. the transfer:"

---

The concourse is a study in squalor. Veteran spacers, faces pockmarked with the characteristic signs of too much radiation exposure, vie for space with synthmorphs bearing the unmistakeable signs of combat damage. Cliques of soldiers, gangers and bodyguards mill about, carrying automatic weapons and making disparaging remarks about anything or anyone entering their field of vision. As stacked rows of hibernation pods are being loaded aboard a freighter's hold, a case - the lowest of the low for synthetic shells - breaks through the cordon and starts screaming. "Don't let them take my body!" The shell is quickly suppressed, and held off to the side, watching with an expressionless face as the cargo finishes loading.

More than once, Damon and the others "see" the characteristic lines of a t-ray scan. The group is being thoroughly and efficiently checked for weapons or valuables, sometimes by the port authority, sometimes not.

> (OOC) Menocal notes that she left her covert ops tool on the ship.

> (OOC) Katja says, "Are /all/ weapons banned, or just firearms/explosives?"

> (OOC) Remus has nothing but a very expensive sleeve. And is considering taking it home and locking it in a safe. c\_c

> (OOC) Doc says, "the message earlier said 'weapon use', which sounds pretty broadly inclusive."

> (OOC) Doc says, "it sounds like you can carry, just not shoot without clearance or graft."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Fun place."

Katja keeps her pistol with her. Makes her feel less naked.

Remus sticks close to Katja. Damon's a better warrior, but Katja's paranoia is more highly tuned. "This place makes my skin want to crawl off and hide behind a thick wall with a very, very large lock."

A few minutes pass. The _Nevsky_'s dock is approached by six figures: one biomorph, with slicked-back black hair and synthetic leathers, decorated by glowing lines of light embedded in the material, three heavy-lifter type cases used for cargo handling, and two synths with embedded weapons. "I'm Banana Grip," he announces, virtually 'handing over' identity confirmation. "Got my cargo?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Can you swap those?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "done, go ahead"

> (OOC) Damon says, "What, I'm not paranoid enough for you, Remus? :D"

Katja gives Remus an amused look. _Don't let them know that, or you'll get mugged._

> (OOC) Doc says, "you guys still have your tactical net running and can mentally communicate without giving away that fact"

Katja smiles at the greasy man. "Everything looks in order, Mr. Grip. Do you have our fee?"

"'Fee' is a dirty word around here, m'lady." Banana Grip gestures around him. "This place is run by anarchists. We trade favors. For example, your ship's had the slag beat out of it. I've got a good crew of techs, a maker, and a supply of volatiles and ore. A full re-arm, refuel, plus some walkin'-around money for each of your crew. Fair enough?"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Note that I'm not asking for extra money. We're owed a docking fee from this guy, right?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "yeah. He probably wants to see his box first."

> (OOC) Remus says, "What's his mood like, GM? How much is he hiding?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "your Kinesics is?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "60"

> (OOC) Damon might as well get a read of him, while we're at it. Kinesics of 50.

_Let me play him,_ Remus thinks. _Maybe we can get some time on a fabber for Katja._

Katja hmms. _He already said he'll give us access to a maker._

> (OOC) Remus says, "Anybody else have any special requests?"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Honestly, I don't see any reason to refuse this guy."

_Sounds good,_ adds Damon. _I've got a bit of a shopping list myself. Let's do this._

> (OOC) Katja says, "So, are you going to do anything, Remus? Or should I just talk to the guy?"

Remus nods. "More than fair. But truth be told, 'walking around' in this place," he waves a hand to take in the twisted majesty of the Grapevine, "sounds like a good way to lose your skin. My friends would like to do some shopping. If you can lend us a guide, maybe they'll live long enough to pay."

Banana Grip snaps his fingers; his armed synth associates step forward. "Done."

> (OOC) Remus says, "OK. So not the Camp David Accords. but I have to practice my craft sometime."

Katja raises an eyebrow at Remus. _Well done. Anything else?_ Her hand hovers over the access for the cargo bay doors.

_Nope,_ Remus replies. _And honestly, the sooner this thing is out of our custody, the better for us. Open 'er up._

> (OOC) Remus says, "Unless the thing has morphed into Godzilla while unattended, that should be it. c\_c"

Katja smiles pleasantly as she opens the cargo bay doors. Move it along, move it along. "Your cargo, sir."

The loader cases that Grip brought along hustle over, calling in some of the dock's own robotics. After a minute's inspection, one of them calls out: "Everything checks out, boss!" Banana Grip smiles. A moment later, a ping comes up on Katja's AR, indicating that docking fees for the next week have been paid.

"Happy sightseeing, ladies and gentlemen!" announces Banana Grip. "I'll send some boys around to keep an eye on things while your repairs proceed." He turns, intending to go about his business.

> (OOC) Doc says, "unless you stop him, the cargo will get offloaded safely."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Sounds fine. So who stays with the ship? I think we'd all like to have a look around."

> (OOC) Damon says, "I say Katja and I should take turns minding the ship."

Four more heavily armed and armored synths, all displaying identification as associates of Banana Grip, arrive as the cargo is half done unloading. They wave casually but don't speak, instead taking up positions at the airlocks.

> (OOC) Katja says, "Agreed."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Okay. and since you guys are all here:"

> (OOC) Doc says, "Everybody record a +5 to your c-rep. Mickey Sullivan's good word bought you some credibility in a dive like this."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Everybody record a +10 to your i-rep, and take 5 points of Networking: Firewall for free. The messages you guys got earlier were supportive and welcoming."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Neat."

> (OOC) Doc says, "alright. You got a message earlier, a contact on Phelan's Recourse - a cyclic farrago of ships and habitats - knows something about Wilhab. wasn't mentioned what. But you can send a beta to talk to him there, or just send email, or whatever."

> (OOC) Doc says, "you can also wander around Kronos, stock up on gear, etc. Pose ICly whatever you guys are doing."

> (OOC) Doc says, "You have about 90,000 credits equivalent each in cash."

> (OOC) Katja says, "\*\_\*"

> (OOC) Remus says, "... whoa."

> (OOC) Damon says, "Cha-ching. Man, this'll take a while to spend."

> (OOC) Remus says, "I don't even know what to spend it on. o\_O"

> (OOC) Doc says, "whatever was in that box was pretty valuable. you guys didn't run off with it."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Well. My job is to observe life among the different factions, and detect existential threats. So. I follow Katja and/or Damon around to do those two things, and to negotiate their sales."

> (OOC) Remus states it ICly.

Katja says, "I'm seeing a trip to the bank in my future. Plans? A good meal, browsing about for fun new gadgets, restocking grenades and ammo, trying to produce the nanonet grenades. Maybe get into a card game or two."

Katja rubs her hands together in glee.

Menocal follows along as well, looking at what appears to be utterly random things,

Remus sees a note appear in his interface - a huge deposit to an account in his name. The amount gives even a diplomat pause for thought. "Well, someone thought it was worth paying for. Anyway, I'd like to tag along. We can take some of these bruisers with us, and I'm more than happy to haggle for you."

Damon in particular gets a few second looks from packs of Remade 'morphs patrolling the dock, all wearing Kronos Port Authority uniforms and packing heavy heat. It's the look predators adopt when sizing each other up. These must be the ultimate mercs who took over the KPA, and now effectively run the station. But nobody says anything and nobody starts anything.

> (OOC) Doc says, "alright. You guys are more or less free to pose your activities here. I'll signal if something goes awry. If you want to throw yourselves on the whims of fate, I can also pose. o\_o;"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Right now I just want to observe. This place is run by anarchists - but that's almost an oxymoron."

> (OOC) Doc says, "It works out pretty well. unless someone else is going, let me illustrate:"

> (OOC) Remus says, "The currents of power are never so simple. If anything, they have to be more complicated. So let's just go shopping and see what turns up."

---

Katja finds entertainments and diversions aplenty. From the Gold Guild arms dealers in their zero-gravity dishdasha robes, to people selling 'morph joyriding at 3000 credits per hour, to the games played in the station's network - mostly high-bandwidth deathmatches with varying levels of adherence to physics. There are pockets of classical gaming interests in the carnage, but most prefer to play online rather than deal physical cards.

Menocal finds something of interest as well. The moon Rhea has a highly-directional antenna pointed at Saturn, used for monitoring atmospheric conditions for the gas miners throughout the moons. But apparently the locals have taken to shifting the radio frequencies the gas giant emits into sound, in the range audible to humans, and have been remixing it. The sound is ethereal and alien, but also captivating whe listened to long enough.

> (OOC) Doc says, "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFFGdTI9KeA - basically this, but like a 'classic hits' compilation."

> (OOC) Doc says, "and infinitely better-sounding"

Menocal ooohs

> (OOC) Remus says, "That is... pretty amazing. o\_o"

> (OOC) Remus must afk, brb

> (OOC) Katja says, "That sounds freaking creepy."

Remus finds the political and economic situation more to his tastes than the artistic scene. Kronos is an example of an anarchist-run habitat, albeit one with high levels of internal dissent. Groups of gangs, like-minded professionals, spacers, soldiers and other people who still need oxygen to survive have set up neighborhoods throughout the habitat. They trade their skills, working hours a day or week in exchange for access to the materials that sustain life: an oxy-nitrogen atmosphere, organics for food, water, and energy for light and heat. The source of these things is the mining robotics on Rhea, and skimmers which work the rings of Saturn. The KPA oversees the whole affair, protecting the weak and eliminating the strong, never hostile enough to force an alliance.

The cartels and cliques pool their resources together, so that (for example) the cronies who gather around Hangar 9 all have stockpiles of hydrogen, oxygen, and other valuables, along with their own maker. Their people are taken care of first; surplus materials are bartered for with other individuals or groups.

> (OOC) Doc says, "with these things in mind, anything else you guys want to get done?"

Menocal gets some of the music, because it sounds incredibly awesome. She also looks at some weapons... stunners, pretty much.

> (OOC) Doc says, "you can get such things. pay outta your cash reserves and equip yourself as you like."

Remus files it all away in the form of a knowledge base for the Col-Am diplomats. He has no need to exploit these people at the moment, and the social dynamics are fascinating. Without the constant undercurrent of violence, it would almost be pleasant.

> (OOC) Remus says, "Which makes me think. What kind of communications gear can we get for 90 kiloquid?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "you personally? the ship refit will come with a standard set"

Menocal calls Damon on the link. _You know lasers and other violent things. I trust you to find me one I can work with. I'd like to have something other than my stunner for really bad emergencies._

> (OOC) Katja says, "I have a shopping list."

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. anything short of thermobaric seeker missiles or something like that is probably approved."

> (OOC) Damon says, "Drat."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Are we going with average price?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "yes"

> (OOC) Doc says, "actually I'll rule: weapons and armor are 10% lower than standard/average prices, in all cases"

> (OOC) Doc says, "Everything else is average price"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Does that include ammo?"

_Good timing,_ replies Damon. _I was just going through the catalog. Got a preference? Stopping power, concealability? Far away or close combat?_

> (OOC) Doc says, "sure, ammo included"

> (OOC) Remus says, "How about more of those remote units? Can we get some more of those?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Peferably armed, for the next time we get boarded."

> (OOC) Doc says, "the which?"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Also, I assume Menocal will lean toward beam weapons..."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Oh yeah, what will be the cost of getting some protoype net grenades?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "what you'll do is buy the materials and fab those yourself aboard ship, once the repairs are done."

> (OOC) Doc says, "so for now we'll ignore cost"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Drones, like the one that we were using to explore the evacuated part of the ship, after we got thawed out."

> (OOC) Doc says, "ahh, the automech. You can buy various synthmorphs or robots at cost."

> (OOC) Damon says, "My first recommendation to Menocal would be a microwave agonizer. Small-sized, can be used to inflict pain or switched to roast mode for actual damage."

> (OOC) Menocal /Concealability,/ replies Menocal, /but stopping power is also good. far away, I do not like to be in hand-to-hand combat./

> (OOC) Doc says, "Damon, you and Menocal want to do this ICly?"

> (OOC) Menocal ack

Menocal replies, _Concealability. Stopping power is also good. I do not like to punch people or be punched._

> (OOC) Katja says, "Ok. Well Kat picks herself out some $28,845 (10% off!) worth of grenades and ammo: 3 EMP, 1 Concussion, 5 Frag, 2 Plasmaburst, all sticky, and another case of AP rifle rounds (100) and AP pistol rounds (100)."

> (OOC) Doc says, "k"

_Microwave agonizer is the weapon for you, I think,_ advises Damon. _Can be used much like your stunner if you do not wish to make a lasting impression, or to roast your enemies if you do. I suggest a laser sight or smartlink, for you do wish to hit that which you aim upon._

> (OOC) Damon says, "more"

_A smartlink, you can fire around corners, which I think you would appreciate,_ Damon adds. _Laser sight, you must still look at your target with your eyes, but if you do this, you can also paint a target for myself or Katja._

> (OOC) Menocal says, "do you need some special gear for a smartlink to work on a gun? I forgot, and it's not mentioned that Menocal has that in her morph. x.x"

> (OOC) Doc says, "nope, it plugs into your normal mesh inserts"

> (OOC) Remus wants to throw something in here

Menocal thinks, then responds, _can we get two of them, one with each, so I can be ready depending?_

_You may simply have both upon the same weapon, if you like,_ replies Damon.

> (OOC) Damon says, "You only get the +10 attack bonus from one or the other - they're not cumulative."

> (OOC) Menocal says, "That's fine!"

Menocal ...

_While we're at it, can you find us some automechs, like the ones on the ship?_ Remus asks. _Four more, something Doc can drive, preferably armed._

Menocal'nods', her icon doing the same. _Then that would be good. And yes, I will see what I can find._

> (OOC) Doc says, "'automech' means more or less 'astromech droid like R2D2', for what it's worth :)"

> (OOC) Remus says, "If I were in a place where you can by R2 units, I'd want a few. o\_o"

Doc chips in. _I've got a shell design I'm working on, Remus. I think it'll be a novel departure from traditional flexbot designs, but having more automechs aboard can't be a bad thing._ He pauses. _Bad news, by the way. I think I found the identity of the buyer._

Remus pauses in mid-stride and gets his back to a wall. Some news should not be taken at a walk. _I didn't anticipate that being bad news. So hit me._

Menocal's icon - as she made one for the tacnet to allow her to communicate with gestures and expressions along with just words - makes the 'please don't hit me hard' motion.

_'Banana Grip' is a shared alias used by members of the ID Crew, the criminal organization. That in itself should not come as a surprise, frankly.._ Doc pauses, sounding almost embarrassed. _I performed some calculations. First, based on the weight and volume of the storage unit, assuming that it is indeed what it appears, it has a fixed storage capacity. For the magnitude of the reward, something of considerable wealth must be inside. The most logical such cargo would be egos._

_I'm unclear on the implications,_ Remus replies. _Forgive my naivete, and I understand this sounds bad, but why is delivering a box full of egos to the ID Crew particularly bad?_

Katja clenches her jaw and stops browsing beautiful balls that makes things go boom. _It doesn't matter. Stop poking about. We've been paid. The more you look into it, the less happy you will be. Just take your pay, smile, spend some money, and we'll be on our way in much better shape._

Doc goes on. _I investigated several possibilities. Fork-napping seems possible, but my limited information suggests that courier duty for important forks would never be given to unknown parties like us. Thus it seems more likely that they are simply indentured or enslaved infomorphs, individually of little societal value, but collectively profitable._

The infomorph's voice continues. _If these are bound for the ID Crew, they are not bound for a life of resettlement and happiness, Katja. While I am not taking action at this point, this is not something I feel comfortable engaging in again._

_Self-respect pays no bills,_ puts in Damon. _Still, there are other ways to make money, especially if you already have some. Unless another disaster befalls us, we now can choose to be more choosing about the contracts we take._

Remus starts to feel sick, when just a few minutes ago Kronos wasn't looking so bad. _Either way, let's get our stuff and get back to the ship. Suddenly I don't feel fit to mingle with decent humans._

_Lucky for you such specimens are in short supply here,_ supplies Damon.

> (OOC) Doc says, "alright. anything else tonight?"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Is it possible to get bioware or cyberware installed here? I've got a few minor line items of that sort."

> (OOC) Doc says, "certainly"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Lastly: fabber blueprints for ammo."

> (OOC) Doc says, "you can buy em at cost, no 10% discount"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Automechs. I'm looking up the cost."

> (OOC) Doc says, "your money won't magically evaporate before next session. You guys have a couple weeks to hash out your purchases"

> (OOC) Remus says, "I can't find prices anyway."

> (OOC) Doc says, "I'll show you later then. meanwhile:"

---

> (OOC) Damon puts together shopping list on a spreadsheet.

The next six days are spent by the automechs and technicians that Banana Grip has supplied. The mechanics come from three different factions aboard the station, and each came armed as well as equipped for repairs. Damon catches one of them quietly handing parts off to a couple of urchins on the dock. But before he acts, he's tagged by one of Grip's own bodyguards, who also saw it: "Let them alone," the guard 'synth advises over radio. "_Jeitinho_, you know? Boss will cover the lossage, it's just how things are done."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Institutionalized bribery? Hmm."

> (OOC) Damon says, "More akin to gleaning."

> (OOC) Remus wonders if that's it, or if the GM is typing.

Over several days the ship takes shape under the watchful eyes of the techs, as well as its crew. The infrastructure for self-repair and self-improvement is all they care about; after that, the ship will do the rest of the work itself.

> (OOC) Doc says, "sorry, got pulled away by a question elsewhere"

Finally the schematics aboard the ship get put into read-write mode. Katja and the others are free to adjust the parameters of their vessel, and self-repair has begun.

The ship's computers are filled once again, a far cry from their old and damaged states. A fraction of humanity's knowledge is poured into the storage media - system maps, XP feeds, theories, gossip, religion.

> (OOC) Remus says, "Anybody given any thought as to our next stop?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "I want to know what happened at WilHab."

Doc hasn't relented in his investigation. With only a few hours left before full repair, he makes an announcement to the crew. "I've been watching the XP feeds from the dock most carefully, my friends. I regret to say that we are not the only ship that has been offloading large metal cubes which look to be storage. I.. I cannot imagine where so many souls could have come from."

> (OOC) Doc says, "messages from earlier said that a Firewall guy on Phelan's Recourse knows about Wilhab and can help you"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Or maybe we'll stick around for a few days. o\_o"

> (OOC) Doc says, "closing poses. o\_o"

Damon is in talk-mode on the Untergang tacnet, but doesn't broadcast for a while, as if he's thinking about what to say. Finally: _A large number of orphaned and captive infomorphs, all of a sudden. This... may be Sentinel work, after all. Have we a way of contacting Firewall, without the awareness of those who deal in these cubes?_

"The Eye is a heavily encrypted VPN. You can broadcast your concerns locally. The 'Happenstance' forums seem to concern Saturn," Doc answers. "I think we should be okay."

Remus has spent the last few days splitting his time between the ship's biolab and excursions on the Vine. He's reminded himself to observe without judging; and especially not to judge himself or his colleagues. There's still no answer as to what happened on Wilhab, and no clear signs of where to go next. He decides to take Doc's revelation as an excuse for action. "Either way, I don't like being used. If the rest of you are willing... I want to know what's going on here."

Katja says, "This is a very bad place to go digging, and I don't feel at all comfortable with it."

"Then we should at least bring this to a wider audience amongst our fellow Sentinels," says Damon. "So many lost souls may be missed from whence they come, and accumulating so many in one place may be more than the work of commonplace slavers. We of all people should know that what we do not know _can_ hurt us."

"A recon, then," Remus says. "This wasn't far off from the matter on Wilhab - all that CPU, enough for thousands of infomorphs. And here are thousands of dormant egos. Maybe this time we'll remember what happened."

Katja says, "Can it? I do not feel part of some brotherhood out to save the world. I signed up for work, not heroics. We have a good thing right now. They wouldn't be putting money into repairs and keeping us happy if there were some plot to snatch us. As far as I can see, we got money and a bit of leisure time here. When we leave, we will be in good shape to go poking into things. Right now? It's a death wish. Maybe even a permanent one."

Damon laughs. "I would as soon not be mired either, Katja. But our employers are in the heroism business. High risk to be sure, but reward may also be high, in favors if not in creds."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Sounds like we better work this out next time. :/ We are staring at a serious risk here."

Menocal says, "I do not think it would hurt to at least look around a little tiny bit."

> (OOC) Damon says, "To be clear, Damon isn't going to take the initiative in an investigation. He /does/ advise putting it on the Eye for a wider audience, and as the Sentinels on the spot, we may end up being the Hands - but then, maybe not."

> (OOC) Damon says, "But yeah, this is for laters."

> (OOC) Doc says, "alright. wrapping up for tonight:"

It's not an easy decision. Nor will it be decided quickly. But it seems that the crew is now faced with a choice: find their contact on Phelan's and learn more about their time on Wilhab, or stay for a time, and see what should be done about the cargo cubes. Then again, perhaps they are the same investigation...
