# Untergang 2011-08-18

The refit of the _Alexander Nevsky_ included a fully-functional nanofactory: a chamber yards in diameter, filled with high-density industrial nanomachines. With this, and with the system of arteries and veins already embedded into the ship, other systems can be built. Systems like a quantum farcaster.

Firewall has put in a bit of influence and purchased a block of entangled qubits from vendors on Kronos. With these, the ship itself is able to egocast - that is, to teleport a mind from transmitter to receiver. Upon arriving at the destination, an ego will either become an infomorph, or be sleeved into a material shell.

Sometimes it's not vital that a whole mind be transmitted. A partial copy, called a beta fork, can be sent at substantially cheaper rates. It's less "real" than a full mind, or alpha fork. It lacks that inner fire that characterizes a real transhuman. But it's convincingly intelligent and can interact with other transhumans well enough to conduct business.

Doc is overseeing the operation of the farcaster. His AR-managed image stands in the field of vision of anyone close enough to the equipment, as he seemingly interacts with the keyboards and touchable surfaces of the components. In reality it's all just software interacting with software, but the living body he apparently inhabits is one of Doc's more harmless eccentricities.

"A beta broadcast will be a good first test of the system," he announces to nobody in particular - simply for the benefit of lifelogging the experience. "Phelan's is a reasonably reputable location, politically neutral, and just close enough that we can troubleshoot any problems that arise."

> (OOC) Doc says, "so far so good? ^\_^"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Yeah, good intro."

> (OOC) Doc loiters about for a bit to see if the boys show up. c.c

> (OOC) Doc says, "Mike just arrived"

> (OOC) Damon has connected.

> (OOC) Damon viewlog's

> (OOC) Doc says, "this is good enough! let's roll."

> (OOC) Remus has connected.

> (OOC) Doc says, "viewlog plz, Remus"

> (OOC) Remus volunteers

The beta forks are prepared, and overseen by Doc. The result is a consciousness hosted by the computers of the _Nevsky_. It feels like one sat down in the ego bridge pod, then gradually shifted from their body - like an astral projection experience, or a particularly lucid dream. The neural pruning is a peculiar sensation to recover from. The worst of it is to see another you staring into the computer screen in which you 'live', watching you as you watch them.

> (OOC) Remus says, "Color commentary welcome?"

Transmission commences. Doc-alpha observes the process by which the farcaster's own AI operates the machinery. For simple transmissions, this will suffice. For the next hour, the beta forks live in a state of relative isolation, with multimedia feeds, music, and such to keep them relaxed. It's something like sitting in an infinitely large waiting room.

> (OOC) Doc says, "Go for it"

Remus was quick to volunteer for this trip. He went through several forks and merges in diplomatic training, but the Col-Am, as a rule, tend to stick to their birth bodies... up until recently there was nowhere to go and no reason to accept visitors. The dozen or so times he's done it, it reminded him unpleasantly of being drunk, or dreaming, or both. So the real challenge will be practicing the trade of diplomacy while voluntarily handicapped. He gets a moment of vertigo as his double appears, and wonders if forks feel melancholy over being less real... or worse, if his idea of 'real' is just a Col-Am archaism.

> (OOC) Remus says, "Go"

Phelan's Recourse is a cyclic orbit of any number of spacecraft, habitats, and floating debris which have been lashed together. Firewall has connections with a faction that'll handle receipt of egos. The emergence is abrupt; the betas find themselves sitting in a virtual limbo, surrounded on all sides by advertising banners hanging in the void. They have arrived as infomorphs. But they have arrived safely.

Ali Rashid is a dealer in xeno-artifacts coming from the Pandora Gate. He collects, curates, and trades anything he can get his hands on that came from beyond the solar system. His online "shop" isn't hard to find, and transferring through the mesh to make a secure connection takes only a minute.

> (OOC) Doc says, "if you want to do something other than go right to talking with him, tell me now"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Good to go."

> (OOC) Damon says, "Go for it."

Ali Rashid himself zones into a simulspace of his shop, finding the _Nevsky_'s crew waiting for him. He's a short man, dressed in what must pass for traditional garments among the Arab ethnos on Earth - something totally impractical to wear in zero gravity, but ideal in VR.

"You are the survivors of Wilhab," he notes, an unspoken question in his tone.

"So we have been told," Remus answers.

"Well? What about it? You lived. Who told you to come here?" Ali asks, sounding irritated.

> (OOC) Remus says, "Anyone else have an urge to field that? The note was anonymized."

> (OOC) Katja says, "I honestly don't even remember how we heard about this place."

> (OOC) Doc says, "if only we had logs posted on the site that you could search."

> (OOC) Doc | The second is an anonymized note: "Some sentinels don't go back when they lack. Some do. If you go back to Wilhab, get some false ID. Your infomorph can do an ego edit to mask your signatures, you'll need it. Check with Ali Rashid on Phelan's for details about the situation on Wilhab. He can also get the forged records."

> (OOC) Remus just read that, and answers.

> (OOC) Katja says, "Ah. I only remember the first part. Sorry. I'm so tired I couldn't even finish my dinner. Chewing... Zzzz... ;)"

"We don't know," Remus answers honestly. "An anonymous party - we can only presume them to be a friendly associate, based on the medium - told us that you had the details about Wilhab. And could arrange appropriate identification for us, should we choose to go back." He pauses. "I think we can't make a decision about going back, until we know what happened."

Ali scowls. "Well why does that even _matter_? You lived, you walked outta there. Nobody's asking you to go back. Just forget about it. Go away."

> (OOC) Remus frowns. "Why should he even care?"

Katja watches on amused. "Normally, I would agree with you. The thing is that this has the potential to bite us in the ass at a later date."

"Bullshit." Ali snorts. "The job was done."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Is there an applicable skill here? Like kinesics or perception?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "I'm already rolling Kinesics. bear in mind you're in a simulspace owned by this guy, so you could be made to see anything"

> (OOC) Remus has a purring cat on the keyboard.

> (OOC) Remus back in a moment

> (OOC) Doc says, "if anyone else wants to chime in, do so :)"

> (OOC) Remus guesses we have to play this straight.

> (OOC) Remus says, "What were we able to find out about this guy before we came here? Or while we were waiting in the dock?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "more or less what I gave you: collector of xeno-artifacts. probably member of Firewall given that a Firewall person referred you here"

> (OOC) Doc says, "if you ping him, he has ridonkulously high i-rep."

> (OOC) Remus says, "i-rep being firewall street cred?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "yes"

"Was it?" Remus asks. "We've reason to believe that wasn't the end of it... whatever it was. All we remember is that there was a lot of CPU there - more than the normal hab functions could account for. The rational first guess is that it was for running egos. And a lot of mass storage from all over Saturn seems to be moving through Kronos. Wilhab may not have been the only instance."

Ali shakes his head. "Well fine, but.. if your job's over, and nobody's given you an assignment, why are you bothering with such details?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Anyone else have an answer?"

> (OOC) Damon says, "I've got something."

"Is this just a general life lesson about leaving well enough alone?" asks Damon, growing impatient with Ali's reticence to discuss the matter. "Or is there something _specific_ you're trying to protect us from?"

A moment passes. Ali smiles. "Well. You came here. You could have left well enough alone. You didn't." He clasps his hands together. "I sent you that message. Let me tell you why."

> (OOC) Doc says, "he's got more unless you guys speak"

> (OOC) Remus says, "I thought so."

> (OOC) Remus says, "But if I'd said 'ok, this is a firewall test, guess what? We ARE that stupid.' It wouldn't have gone over as an honest answer from Damon."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Anyway, Fire away"

"Not every new sentinel appreciates what Firewall is. We aren't a top-down authority. We are a mutual aid society for those who wish to prevent another Fall. Firewall works because its people care. If you didn't come back.. well. Then the organization would have miscalculated."

Ali goes on. "You haven't heard anything on the Eye about Wilhab because when a sentinel goes missing, or might be compromised, we temporarily revoke their keys, and cancelbots start censoring posts with keywords related to their last mission. My job was to assure Firewall that you're still in the game, and to give you new keys if you were."

> (OOC) Doc says, "nuttin? :D"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Working on it"

Remus nods. "That makes sense. When you told us that nobody's given us an assignment, it sounded strange. Firewall's not a plumbing service, centrally dispatched and paid by the hour."

Damon rubs his chin in thought. Being an infomorph isn't customary for him, and he clings to the habits of flesh. "Okay, I like that line a lot better. Much nicer, friendlier. So... once we've got our new keys, we'll get to find out about Wilhab?"

> (OOC) Remus wonders if those should swap

> (OOC) Doc does so

Ali laughs. "Well, what data there is can be accessed with your new keys. Carry these back with you when you leave." The group's Muses register the receipt of secure crypto keys, automatically registered with the Eye. "But I can tell you the tale as it was told to me..."

> (OOC) Doc says, "barring any other comments, I'll summarize that now"

> (OOC) Remus says, "go"

---

The team formulated plans, did research, and even performed some preliminary recon. What they found was that any living being, of any kind, would be spotted entering the Wilhab Garden site. Doc and Menocal discovered large amounts of data coming in and out of the site, which Doc had surmised were packages of infomorphs and virtual reality data.

The only way in was to go virtual. The team backed itself up, resleeved as infomorphs, and penetrated the facility's systems. The next thing anyone knew, they'd come out, declaring an emergency over the Eye, and requesting pickup. Everyone's minds had been infected with some sort of exsurgent virus - not a physical infection, but a memetic or hypnotic attack which changed their behavior, and caused them to release a physical virus into the rescue ship.

In desperation, the rescue team beamed back a course, and a final message: "Attempting to purge ship's systems, entering hibernation."

Whatever happened inside the Wilhab Garden, then, involved the TITANs. Nobody has gone back since, but Firewall has begun assembling other teams in case a rapid response becomes necessary.

---

> (OOC) Doc says, "comments or reactions welcome"

Damon looks grim. "So that's where we picked it up," he says. "And... that makes those huge data cubes floating around Saturn even _more_ suspicious. I _hope_ it's something completely unrelated, but hope in one hand and crap in the other and see which one fills up first.."

Remus blanches, and knows a Beta fork can, at least, feel cosmic fear. "Just how much storage do you think it would take to ship around the ego-cognate of a TITAN?"

"No man can say," murmurs Ali. "But it'd be quite enough to have thousands of infected infomorphs scattered around the system. That'd be bad enough.. oh yes."

> (OOC) Remus gaaah

"Then I'm still in," Remus replies. "And we're in trouble."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Do we wanna go back?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "I will assume that your betas hang out to ask more questions if you want, so we can write a closing pose here to summarize your plans"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Okay, we ask more questions. I don't know if I know enough to say that we want to go back or not."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Plans? What kind of plans can we make for this? o.o;"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Did we 'kill' the thing on Wilhab? Or did we bail before the job was done?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "ask about that."

> (OOC) Doc says, "(ask ICLy that is)"

"So did we stop the thing on Wilhab," Remus adds, "or did we leave before the job was done?"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Do we know what happened to the guy we found?"

Ali thinks about that. "You should read the proxy report filed in the Eye. But... we sent someone back to the station. They said that the network traffic Doc and Menocal saw had died off, and couldn't find signs of anything else. So either they're all shut down in there, or they at least stopped operating for now."

> (OOC) Doc says, "The rescue team on the NEvsky? Yes. They got pulled back to life from backups and reassigned."

> (OOC) Katja says, "No, the esper guy."

> (OOC) Doc says, "the guy in the pod who talked to Remus? He was part of the rescue team too"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Ah. Ok."

Remus mulls this over. "Maybe we don't need to go back, then. Or maybe we should postpone that decision until we find out whether or not the same thing is happening on Kronos."

"Well, they're contained. As far as we know," says Damon. "Until they're _stopped_, it isn't over. But another frontal attack isn't going to get us anywhere, and I'd rather test our ability to work together on a different issue. If only so we can remember _doing_ it."

> (OOC) Remus oopses. Wanted that ooc.

> (OOC) Doc says, "It will be something available to you guys before next session, so yes."

> (OOC) Doc says, "tonight is just whatever question-and-answer stuff you guys have for Ali."

> (OOC) Doc says, "and for Pat, I want to wrap soon."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Alright. That's all I have for now."

> (OOC) Katja says, "This has been so horrifying that I have idea what to say."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Actually, I'm going to say that ICly."

Katja says, "This has been so horrifying that I have idea what to say."

"Welcome to Firewall," retorts Ali, bleakly.

> (OOC) Doc says, "last call for closers"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Nope. Ali's got it right there. That's what you say, and he just said it."
