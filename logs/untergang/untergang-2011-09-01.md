> (OOC) Doc says, "Last time, you guys had sent betas to talk to Ali Rashid. While those guys have their conversation, you have time to do other preliminary stuff. As mentioned earlier, your options pretty much are (a) go back to Wilhab, (b) investigate the storage cubes or (c) ignore these things and do something else. The suggestion I made for deciding on these was to ignore risk of death (which is basically a loss of time/resources), but to determine /what you could safely ignore/."

> (OOC) Doc says, "do you guys feel you can safely ignore the storage cube situation on Kronos? If so, do you think you can ignore the mystery on Wilhab?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "The storage cube situation on WilHab is more proximate and seems like a bigger problem. I think it's worth recon."

> (OOC) Doc says, "... on wilhab wut"

> (OOC) Remus says, "... on kronos."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Where we are now."

> (OOC) Doc says, "k"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "Agreed."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Ok."

Firewall SITREP: while beta forks have been dispatched to speak to Ali Rashid, our alphas are beginning an investigation into the storage cubes on Kronos. Request that Firewall review our findings and assign a proxy as needed.

> (OOC) Doc says, "Each of you has some skills at poking around things, or checking things. I want you guys to think laterally and work to your strengths. You have some questions you want answered here:"

> (OOC) Doc says, "1. where are these things coming from, or going to?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "2. are there any discernable patterns in the shipments?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "3. what's really in those cubes? if infomorphs, are they infected?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "4. anything else you guys can think of."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Also: Who benefits from this? The ID Crew is making the payouts. Are they middlemen or masterminds?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "spend a couple minutes and think about how your PC can contribute to this, then go ahead. I'll call for rolls as needed. If you guys run out of juice, let me know and I'll put things in motion."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Yeah."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Damnit. x.x"

> (OOC) Doc says, "Deleted, no sweat."

> (OOC) Doc says, "stealth isn't the end of your ability to contribute. So let's get some stuff ICly here:"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Thanks. x.x"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Well... we can start with this. Remus and Menocal (and largely Doc) tend to accomplish things by schmoozing and hacking; Katja and Damon are both more direct and better with violence. We could work singly or in pairs or in four; and if in pairs, we could either pair 'both schmoozers then both violence' or 'two schmoozer/violent pairs'."

> (OOC) Remus says, "If nobody has any ideas, I suggest we work in pairs: Remus and Katja take a direct investigative approach; Menocal/Doc and Damon take a more sneaky infiltrative approach."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Counting Menocal and Doc as a single entity here because Doc can use Menocal for mobility in meatspace."

Doc begins a review of the available data. "Katja, I have begun assembling data on the other storage cubes. As spime audiovisuals, including history, are available, we can see and therefore correlate cube delivery to starships. What I do not know is the specifics of those ships. Can you do me a favor, and analyze the feeds? I wish to know if there is any similarity in ship make, model, or ownership." After a pause, he continues. "I am also pinging your reputation among anarchists, and you ought to be better than any of us at negotiating with the locals for further information."

> (OOC) Doc says, "You guys can see everywhere along the dock that's public space, and rewind camera history to look and see what previously happened."

> (OOC) Doc says, "if anyone else has specific things they think would be useful, go for it"

"I'm not bad at negotiation," Remus adds. "I'll play backup for Katja. See what else they're saying out there."

Katja throws a couple of messages out to her contacts to see if they can refer her to someone local who might be willing to talk. She pulls up several of the feeds, and starts a cross analysis.

> (OOC) Doc Swaps those. okay, throw some Academics: Aerospace and Networking: Autonomists dice.

> (OOC) Doc says, "very good. Btw, anyone else with Networking: Autonomists or Networking: Criminals is welcome to throw dice and try to work some contacts."

> (OOC) Remus needs a moment

> (OOC) Doc says, "go ahead"

> (OOC) Menocal rolls 1d100 vs. 65 for 87 (failure, MoF 22)

> (OOC) Menocal says, "Nope. nothing for me"

When it comes to discreet inquiries, the inhabitants of Kronos Cluster are remarkably tight-lipped. Nobody seems interested in talking to anybody from the ship. Even the few other spacers the crew think might be approachable have nothing to say, or write back short, dismissive blowoffs. Whatever is going on at Kronos, nobody wants to talk about it. How bad can the situation be?

> (OOC) Remus has 22's on both of those, so tries

> (OOC) Remus rolls help for 0 (0)

> (OOC) Remus oops

Katja's data analysis, taking a feed from Doc and multitasking as much as possible, yields interesting information about the ships: there's absolutely no pattern to them. Crusty old LLOTVs, cargo haulers, cloudrunners from Jupiter, the heavy 'iron maidens' from the belt - all manner of craft have docked here, disgorged storage cubes, and gone their own way. Between them, Katja and Doc estimate about 30 cubes have been delivered here.

> (OOC) Remus rolls 1d100 vs. 22 for 15 (success, MoS 7)

> (OOC) Remus rolls 1d100 vs. 22 for 52 (failure, MoF 30)

> (OOC) Remus says, "Let's call that autonomists and crims, in that order"

That there is no pattern is itself significant. It means that whoever's paying for the hauling doesn't really care about the security of the cargo being shipped. Otherwise, the cubes would only be given to trusted crews on reliable vessels.

> (OOC) Doc says, "Remus does have a guy who'll talk to him, but who wants a meeting. Anyone else want to go along?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "I'm not going without at least one of Katja, Damon, or a nuclear hand grenade"

> (OOC) Katja says, "I'll go."

> (OOC) Doc says, "we'll have Damon stay behind to guard the ship. Doc will come along, and Menocal can too"

---

> (OOC) Remus says, "Can Damon use a pair of automechs to follow us?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "At least as a backup to the public cameras."

> (OOC) Doc says, "if you think having R2D2 along, sans the combative personality, would be useful? Then sure. but your own mesh inserts can also feed him XP in realtime"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Extra pair of hands. I'm fond of the little buggers."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Just one, then."

Remus' contact can be found on one of the outlying vessels that hover, debris-like, around Kronos proper. It's a short EVA with guide-lines and safety hooks, and the shipsuits the crew have available to them will double as spacesuits.

Along with one of the crew's newly-acquired automechs, those who didn't elect to stay with the ship are hauled meter by meter through the vacuum. The airlock of the little craft cycles them through. Inside is no cleaner or neater than Kronos itself, and the craft doesn't even have the luxury of the low-gravity spin that Kronos enjoys. But it is occupied.

The man has white hair despite looking no older than forty. Even basic biomods have done away with aging, but Remus remembers that older individuals don't have complete longevity. "Look at the knuckles," was the advice he remembers, and this man's show a great deal of care. "I'm Alan Zodiac," he says by way of introduction, voice slightly slurred by alcohol. "Az for short, if you're impatient."

Nobody else seems to be present here; Firewall's sentinels easily outnumber or outgun this sole individual. Still, caution seems indicated, if Kronos has taught them anything.

> (OOC) Remus says, "... oh hell."

> (OOC) Remus says, "... I've seen this one. I know how it ends."

> (OOC) Doc says, "you only think you have. Proceed."

Remus finds a place to 'sit' - or near enough - in the cluttered zero-gee environment. That this guy lives alone, or even can, is quite a surprise, given how crowded Kronos is. Maybe he's got companions living in the computers... or maybe nobody else can stand him. Either way, it wouldn't be prudent to assume anything. "I'm Remus. This is Katja, and Menocal. You won't see Doc but he's keeping an eye on us."

> (OOC) Remus Moar

"So..." Remus begins evenly. "We got paid to bring a box here. We're concerned about the number of other crews, doing the same. It doesn't seem to bother the Port Authority, but it still seems like a big, dangerous game. What did you want to tell us about it?"

Katja nods at the old man when introduced. She's not great at getting information out of random strangers, so she busies herself leaning against a wall and scanning the area for a secondary exit.

"I shaw your inquiries on the local mutualist discussions," Az explains. "An' I have a story to tell you..."

> (OOC) Doc says, "here comes the story!"

---

There was a ship, Az explains, called the _Saltwater Baptism_. Its crew was synthmorphs and infomorphs, who ran oxygen-free and maximized their cargo space. They were slowly building up credits on Extropia, running traffic to and from the outer system - morphs, xeno-artifacts, volatiles, and exotic biologicals, anything that'd turn a profit.

The _Baptism_ got an order. Ship a collection of cubes from Jovian space to Kronos. Nobody said what was in them, nor who would be paying for collection, but the money was good - _Baptism_'s captain insisted on credit exchange, to be paid to an Extropian fund, rather than the vagarities of reputation and horse-trading that characterize the outer system's economy.

> (OOC) Remus says, "To be clear, that's like insisting on getting paid in gold or something?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "more or less yeah."

> (OOC) Remus hmm

_Baptism_ sent further messages. Posting via farcaster, they wanted to know if anyone on Kronos had outbound shipments, the usual thing for a cargo hauler. Nobody wants to leave a port empty-handed. But along with that message was another one, to be delivered only to certain trusted anarchists on and around Kronos. It came in the form of a delta fork that would authorize the recipient, and would self-destruct if tampered with - and because the human mind is a labyrinth whose secrets are only opened for those who walk it, it was an effective safeguard.

The second message was this: 'Who has experience in cracking open secure mass storage devices, and wants to make a little extra money?' The _Baptism_ never reached Kronos, and as far as Az knows, never got anywhere else. The ship simply disappeared into the outer dark.

---

> (OOC) Doc says, "if you guys have responses or further questions, go for it."

> (OOC) Damon says, "So to sum up: the /Baptism/ tried to sniff around for someone who could crack their boxes, and was never heard from again."

> (OOC) Doc says, "yeah"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Either they didn't find someone and had a mishap... or they DID find someone, and found out more than was good for them."

> (OOC) Menocal says, "EATEN BY CYBERSNAILS!"

"So the _Saltwater Baptism_ was trying to crack open one of those crates here," Remus muses, "and - whether they did or they didn't - poof. And only their 'trusted anarchist' friends have any hint as to why." He shakes his head. "Sounds like opening Pandora's Box."

Katja says, "This sounds like a space story to scare little children."

"Think what you like, young lady," Az answers sadly. "But I know in my heart that they did. And I know, 'cause I was the one who told them how."

> (OOC) Remus says, "This Az guy. What's his public profile like? One of the anarchists... oh."

> (OOC) Damon says, "Is Damon likely to have a presence?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "I put Damon back on the ship. You can access the XP feeds of these guys annd 'watch' this, and/or speak back to them. you can get on the mesh and talk remotely. You have an automech you can jam."

"I was about to ask," Remus says. "Who they might have found to crack it open."

Az wafts through zero-gravity to collect a drink bulb, and takes a gulp from it. "I took on this old wrecked morph to hide from 'em, if they ever showed up," he remarks. "Nobody would look for a studly young engineer in this beat-up junk. But.. they never came. No recriminations. From anyone. Even, you'll note, ID Crew - and that's who was to get the box. I know that now. They _wanted them opened_."

/It **does** sound like a ghost story, does it not? _says Damon, who is listening in to pass the time while on sentry duty._ But we all know that there **are** ghosts and goblins out there, do we not?/ He pauses to consider Az's remarks. _And we also know, do we not, that there are those who want to let the goblins out._

_And we know what happens,_ Remus thinks. _What happened on the Saltwater Baptism, was probably the same thing as happened on the Nevsky._

Remus nods. "If they haven't come for you now, they probably won't. If you want to leave, I think that we can arrange it."

Damon laughs, over the mesh. _If he is wishing to be safe, do not advise him to come with us._

_They were eaten by TITANs,_ Menocal thinks. _We're going to go right into danger again, aren't we?_

_I didn't offer him safety,_ Remus replies. _I offered him a chance to leave. I'm sure he knows the difference._

> (OOC) Remus says, "Is anything coming or should we say something?"

Az finishes his drink, looking thoughtful. "From your public profiles, you've got an engineer already," he says mournfully. "But... well, we'll see. I know that you lot had a cube of your own, and you did the smart thing. But why come to me?"

> (OOC) Doc just wanted to make sure you guys were done, then fired that off :)

Katja rubs her nose. "This thing isn't like anything I've ever seen before. It's dangerous. It's dangerous in a way that I'm not sure I could build a lab to contain what may be inside it."

Remus nods. "Those cubes are trouble," he says, deliberately letting a bit of real fear through his facade. "I don't think we'll be moving any more of them. But I have to wonder why it takes such effort to crack them. If they're meant to be opened, why make it so hard?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "btw, since you asked: Az's current public profile amounts to 'town drunk'. He's deliberately low-key, doesn't do much, just enough work to sustain his citizenship."

> (OOC) Doc says, "but now you know WHY"

/This is most very useful, _notes Damon._ We now have a new thing for which to look. How many others than the **Baptism** tried to open their puzzle boxes? Who was expected that did not arrive? And perhaps they are selecting for those who are clever enough to open the box./

Az shrugs a bit, tossing the empty drink bulb behind him and onto an adhesive wall full of other such litter. "You'd make it hard to open to make it look like legitimate cargo. Nobody opens a trap that looks like a trap."

> (OOC) Damon says, "Damon is, of course, making what /he/ considers a 'classical reference', in the 'puzzle boxes'."

"These guys on the /Saltwater Baptism," Remus asks. "They were friends of yours? And didn't... uh... respawn, after disappearing?"

_also, that would find people of the level of skill and insight required to open them, and allow whatever is inside them access to those skills and minds._ Menocal's horror at that idea makes her thought-stream twitch a little bit.

"I didn't know 'em personally," Az answers, sounding only a bit more drunk. "But they knew me, through friends of mine. They might have resleeved. If so, I doubt they'd remember what happened. But you can look 'em up, try to find 'em."

"Yes, please," Remus says. "Can't hurt, right?"

With a mental gesture, Az relays a file. The precis that Remus and the others receive is a summary of the engineer's dealings with the _Saltwater Baptism_ and their crew - including ship registration details, known ports of call, and the like.

> (OOC) Doc says, "anything else you want from him for now?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "No. But I think we'll owe him a favor."

> (OOC) Menocal says, "Have to go out for a little bit; back a soon as I can ."

> (OOC) Katja says, "I'm afraid to ask him how to open it. Is that really information we neeD?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "that's your decision to make."

> (OOC) Remus says, "I wasn't inclined to ask. But if you think it's a good idea, go ahead."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Good idea? Absolutely not. Useful down the road? Probably. But it's like holding a bomb constantly. I'm afraid of being hacked with that kind of knowledge."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Then let's leave the town drunk in peace and go somewhere less decrepit."

Katja says, "Do they differ, the locks? Or are they the same on each cube?"

Katja frowns, and really looks at the man now. "And how did you figure out how to open it without going through the whole process?"

"I sent them a beta fork," Az explains. "Since they wouldn't send the particulars out via farcaster. I took a down-payment, some cargo they were going to pick up here that I'd take ownership of, and beamed them the beta." He lets out a long sigh. "Obviously that never came back either."

Katja says, "I see."

> (OOC) Remus says, "So we've learned a bit more. Now what?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "you can milk him for more details if you want. or go back and investigate other angles."

> (OOC) Doc says, "The idea that people want the cubes opened also raises a question: are any of these cubes being shipped FROM this station? If not, what's happening with them?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "There's a lot of possibilities there. Do they get unloaded, then just loaded onto another ship? Keep moving around in circles or something?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "Yeah. So your next move might be to stake out the Vine, see what happens"

> (OOC) Remus says, "It won't take our forks long to get back from Ali's, right? Or maybe we should send the Betas on to Wilhab?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "the forks on PHelan's will return after this scene, and Doc will re-integrate you"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Then maybe we sould pick those up, and stake out the vine for a while?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "I don't know for sure. I feel like I'm missing something."

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. I'll wrap a bit early then, and we'll get that going."

---

Saying goodbye to Az, the crew returns to the ship, finding Damon. The mercenary is fully up to speed on events, having been reviewing the group's XP feed over the tactical network. And Doc announces that the beta forks from Phelan's are back, and ready for re-integration.

The process is well-understood by this point in time; Doc is a past master of working with forks and merges, particularly his own, and the _Nevsky_'s resurrected computer systems are some of the best in their class. The experience of having two memories of the same time period is a little unsettling, but the human mind's natural tendency to weave truths together - to draw order out of chaos - works in everyone's favor.

With the re-integration come the new cryto keys to access the Eye, and the crew reads over the torrent of details, speculation, and follow-up that have surrounded Wilhab since their departure.

There's a new unanswered question. If the cubes are meant to be opened, then what is the ID Crew doing with them? Shipping them back out is a possibility. If so, there's nothing to do but watch in realtime, and change the spime search parameters from "offloaded cargo" to "onloaded". Beyond that, records of ships which have disappeared may also be useful.

Before any of these new searches are begun, Doc adds a note of caution: "Somebody will be running this operation. They will undoubtedly monitor the mesh for such queries. While it may not be strange for us to have collected general data from the Vine, our more targeted interests should be masked."

"Maybe we should go in person, then," Remus says, "instead of making queries that can be traced."

"Much of the data we need will be stored electronically," muses Doc. "A direct read of those computers _would_ bypass any observers, but... such an operation runs its own risk of detection."

> (OOC) Doc says, "anything further to add tonight?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Not from me."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Not from me."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Though some B&E sounds like fun."
