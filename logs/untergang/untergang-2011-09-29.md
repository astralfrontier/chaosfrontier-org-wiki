Firewall SITREP: the beta forks sent to Phelan's have returned. The team is getting their tools together for an investigation on Kronos.

---

> (OOC) Doc says, "Katja, Networking: Autonomists is at 60. you have 80+ rep with these guys easily. You have two favors you're asking: a High cost one (a fake ID) and a Moderate cost (a case morph)."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Alright. Want me to roll now?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "I assume you want this kept /quiet/ - Kronos is the headquarters of ID Crew, who are responsible for the bulk of fake IDs in the system, and they're who you are investigating. This puts your modifiers at:"

> (OOC) Doc says, "+10 for the ID, anywhere from -10 to -60 for subtlety. Pick a modifier - anyone trying to crack the ID's origin will take the same penalty."

> (OOC) Doc says, "and then 'roll on 60' or 'roll on 70' or whatever your adjusted skill is. you can also take extra time, offer extra cash to improve your odds, etc. You can use moxie after the roll to flip the dice if it comes out bad."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Up to you, but I don't think we have to be too rigorous here. We basically just want something that won't immediately be tracable to us or the Nevsky."

> (OOC) Katja says, "So, if I am understanding, "

> (OOC) Katja says, "I have 60 + 10 on the ID roll, with -10 or more for crackability?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "yeah. it's harder for you to FIND a vendor who is sufficiently secure."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Ok. Does -20 sound reasonable? That should survive an initial scan, and still has a 50/50 chance."

> (OOC) Doc says, "that works fine for me."

> (OOC) Katja rolls 1d100 vs. 50 for 64 (failure, MoF 14)

> (OOC) Katja says, "Moxie. x.x"

> (OOC) Doc says, "you can spend moxie to flip that to 46 for success, ... okay then :)"

The neighborhoods on Kronos are full of the dispossessed, the bitter... and the connected. There's a gang here that Katja remembers reading about from her time in the spaceways, who supplied pirates with false colors while portside. A little spare cash and a lot of insinuation trade hands, but they'd rather supply the team a false identity than get in trouble with the Kronos Port Authority.

> (OOC) Doc says, "same roll for the morph, with a +10"

> (OOC) Katja rolls 1d100 vs. 70 for 31 (exceptional success, MoS 39)

Katja's next destination doesn't have just a case; she has a fully-equipped synthmorph, with a few extra options, hidden in a storage pod near her quarters. "Take it!" she says, "Get it out of here before my wife gets back. As long as I get it back before the end of the month, you are doing _me_ a favor."

> (OOC) Doc says, "and the less said about that story the better"

> (OOC) Menocal says, ""

> (OOC) Remus says, ""

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay, you got your gear. now what?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "... after hearing that? Give it a bath. x\_x"

> (OOC) Doc says, "anyway, open pose. talk about your plan with whoever's here."

> (OOC) Remus says, "But more usefully, I think we should just spend a few days pumping the rumor mills as ourselves. If we find somewhere that we're worried about getting caught we take fake ID and the 'borrowed guy'."

> (OOC) Remus poses, then

Back on the _Alexander Nevsky_, Remus is occupying himself with the Grapevine's public mesh. As usual in a posthuman, anarchist outpost, it's a morass of contradictory information, rumors, lies, conspiracy theories, and prurient content of every possible kind. He sighs. "Maybe we should just spend a few days working the rumor mill, to see which of these are credible," he says. "And when we find a point of maximal interest, one of us should take the 'new guy' and his fake ID in to have a look."

Menocal is looking through the public mesh for, not data about the mission, but for the 'hot' clubs, making notes about them.

"There is bound to be speculation about the nature of the cargo," observes Doc, gesturing at a holographic model of the storage cube he's studying. "Eventually it will be noticed that many ships have brought such cargo to Kronos. They will want information."

Katja clears her throat. "I'll just give it a good dip before anyone crawls into it. There has to be a wash station for decontamination on this ship."

Menocal says, "Probably best.""

Katja says, "I found a few games that should entertain me for a bit. I should be able to get some rumors there."

"Doc," Remus asks. "Are you suggesting that we help the Port Authority? Or do you mean we should see what they've come up with so far?"

Doc thinks about that. "I think that, knowing there will be curiosity, that the ID Crew or whoever is behind this will spread rumors, falsehoods, or even truths - whatever furthers their goals. And their goals seem to be for people to open the seal on the cubes, releasing whatever is inside. They will _provoke_ people to release whatever is inside."

Remus resumes his browse. "So what in this mess is motivating such lethal curiosity? And where does it lead us, physically, on the Grapevine?"

The infomorph sighs a bit, and shrugs. "I.. am not sure. But socially, it will lead us to those haulers who have associates also handling the storage cubes. They will pass this news along. The people we worry about most are those who are well-connected and whose associates lack scruples about opening other peoples' cargo."

Remus says, "I'd think we could find those people with a little work. Or maybe pose as them ourselves, and see where the cubes are coming from. Or where they are going. Most intelligence work can be done with no more than eyes, ears, a notebook, and a good seat at the crossroads." He kicks himself out of the seat. "I think that's where I'll start.""

> (OOC) Remus says, "Because I'd like to do something more than pontificate. :) Don't think this prohibits anyone else from getting their hands more dirty than mine."

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay, sounds good"

Menocal says, "I think I am going to go clubbing this evening. I'm sure there are many interesting things to hear there. I'll have to design a dress, though."

> (OOC) Remus says, "So do we have some rolls coming out of this?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "yeah as soon as I wade through your sheet. please post an easy to read page, not just the XLS, when you have a chance :)"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Will a PDF do?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "...... sure?"

> (OOC) Doc is doing rolls for investigation. so far everything seems good.

> (OOC) Doc says, "SUDDENLY THE STATION ASPLODE"

---

> (OOC) Doc says, "we'll handle Katja first."

Katja finds herself a long-sought invitation to an old Earth staple: a card game, with betting and everything. People these days seem to love these virtual, holographic, stereo-pornophonic massively-multiplayer-action-comedy-roleplaying-puzzle affairs you can play online. There are simpler pleasures in this universe.

The game is exclusively for spacecraft operators, and the neo-gorilla who welcomes her to the table explains an additional rule: the cards themselves are the wager. "If you don't have.. our cards, you can buy in with something else. Or just watch. We like the company of our own here, even if you don't play."

> (OOC) Damon has connected.

> (OOC) Remus eyebrowlift

> (OOC) Katja says, "Is this stricktly a trade buy in, or do they take cred?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "PDF uploadered."

> (OOC) Doc says, "either way. anything of value to a spacer"

Katja briefly pings the participants at the table. All of them have some reputation with Extropia or its factions: they'll take money, credit, goods or favors - anything worth anything.

> (OOC) Remus ugh. "Never mind. pdf borked. Will try again in a moment.

Katja says, "How many credits to buy in?"

The gorilla glances around the table. "20,000, for a new player. We'll go easy on you." He bares a set of functional-looking fangs.

> (OOC) Remus says, "Holy crap. o\_O"

> (OOC) Remus says, "'We could almost buy our own ship for that!'"

Katja leans a bit. "Twenty is a bit steep. I have a counter offer. 10,000 and an engineering favor."

The gorilla grins. "We saw your ship coming in. If you're the engineer, we'll take the favor, no credits needed. Sit down." One of the other spacers pulls out a chair - a gesture of sheer chivalry on a low-gravity habitat - and the dealer slides over a set of cards. They aren't like conventional printed playing cards out of a nanofactory; these hold _data_ of some kind, and have smart elements printed on the face.

Katja flashes a genuine smile at the grunt and the player who pulled out the chair. "Cheers, boys. Always nice to be appreciated. What are we starting with?" She picks up her cards and examines them carefully.

> (OOC) Doc says, "This isn't any variation of poker or other games that a player here would likely know, so we'll handle it abstractly. Your decision is: do you want to play to win, play to gain sympathy (and possibly get on board some of these guys' ships to do engineering), or other?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "to an extent, you must also be a good gambler :) Otherwise your strategy consists of 'lose gracefully'"

> (OOC) Katja says, "I have no particular gambling skills on my character sheet."

> (OOC) Katja says, "She's honestly there for the conversation and a bit of fun."

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay :)"

It becomes clear to Katja what sort of game this is after a few rounds. The participants here - aside from the neo-gorilla, two synthmorphs, three biomorphs, what looks like a potted plant with prehensile tendrils and a cigar-smoking neotenic - know each other to a greater or lesser extent. The cards are an excuse. They are using this game to practice their people-reading skills on each other. Aside from being pilots, they are also merchantmen.

Reviewing her other logs and XP records, she knows something else. At least four people at the table here brought storage cubes to the station within the memory of the dock's cameras.

> (OOC) Remus says, "Oho."

The table banter is casual, sometimes mocking, appropriate for rivals and friends. Gradually they open up a little more, giving Katja glimpses - but no more. They are studying her, just as she is listening to them.

> (OOC) Damon says, "As with cards, so with social interaction. To win, you have to ante up."

> (OOC) Doc says, "if you did anything clever, like slave Remus to your XP feed to benefit from his Kinesics skill, you can probably find out more. As it stands, you're going to get some personal details that you could read out of their public profile, and owe a lot of people some engine work, before the night is over."

> (OOC) Katja says, "That sounds like a very bright idea. I was just going to ask if the tacnet was in place this far out."

> (OOC) Doc says, "you can definitely have it running anywhere there's a public mesh - which includes all habitats"

> (OOC) Doc says, "so feel free to pose any such arrangements you may have made, and also your end of the friendly card game :)"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Would they notice?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "A bunch of crusty old spacedogs like these guys would be surprised if you DIDN'T have some kind of secret dealings going on. As posed, these guys are using the game as a proxy/training for real business dealings, and they would most assuredly use such tricks when doin that"

> (OOC) Remus says, "I'm game for that. :)"

> (OOC) Damon says, "In other words, "Go ahead, bring a ringer. We did.""

Katja pokes at Remus over the tacnet. _Are you getting my feed? And no comments about my playing ability. That's not what this is about._

> (OOC) Doc says, "Exactly!"

Remus is ensconsed at a corner table on sidewalk cafe on the Vine. A few credits to the bouncers have bought him several hours of peaceful drinking while the best and worst of transhumanity cross by in front of him. One corner of his vision is given over to the visual XP's of the crew. _I've been watching. You're overmatched. No dishonor in that. Just relax and follow my cues._

> (OOC) Doc says, "Katja, you can use Remus' help to turn the tables - he's actually quite good at this sort of thing. If so, pose doing so and starting to edge ahead."

> (OOC) Remus says, "I'll try to keep it subtle. Don't want to win by TOO much."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Urk. AFK for just a couple of minutes."

> (OOC) Doc says, "ok"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Back. Sorry."

> (OOC) Doc says, "all good. pose away :)"

After getting an idea of the playing styles of her opponents, Kat slowly starts improving her hands. When she gets enough to make a serious wager, she starts doing so. Her wide grin and chuckle let the other players know it is all done in good fun. She has a bit of a reputation for putting a lot on the line just to see if she'll get through.

The other players start to exchange knowing looks, or other brief and coded bits of body language. Remus recognizes it: they're onto the trick, but aren't doing anything about it. This is also part of the game that's being played.

By the end of the night, owing to the rules of the game, Katja is in for three engine tune-ups, but also has twenty-five cards to her name. The other players sit back, order up drinks from a servitor 'bot one of them has brought along, or bid each other good night. "Come back again," the gorilla offers to Katja. "We'll play for easier stakes once this whole business is over."

> (OOC) Remus oops, deletes

Katja raises an eyebrow. "There did seem to be quite a bit going on."

"The v-habs," the gorilla explains. He catches the brief look of incomprehension, and launches right into an explanation. "The data storage you and half of Kronos have been bringing here. Most of these idiots haven't noticed. But we've all been hired to haul identical cubes here. Word from a contact of mine is that they contain extensive VR data and infomorphs - enough to host a whole city and its inhabitants, maybe."

> (OOC) Damon says, "Has he heard from said contact recently? o.o"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Actually, let me do that ICly."

_Wait a minute,_ Damon says. He's been kibitzing the whole game in complete incomprehension - seven-card stud is more his speed - but a nugget of real information can get through even his thick skull. _How did this contact of his know what's in the things? Remember the 'crazy old man' and his story of trying to open one?_

Katja hums. "That's a lot of space to move so quickly and under the radar. Almost doesn't make sense. They're not so easy to crack open. How do you really know what is inside?"

The gorilla holds up his depleted hand of cards. "Each of these's an infomorph, my friend, and passive memory sweeps tie them to the v-habs. You won yourself twenty-five souls tonight."

> (OOC) Damon says, "That's creepy, but can someon translate 'passive memory sweeps' into jarhead?"

In answer to a question asked silently by Damon, Doc interjects over the link. _He means that an infomorph is digitally signed when it is instantiated or stored. The keys used for that signing are in turn trusted by other keys. He probably poked at his own storage cube just enough to find their keys. In physical terms, like matching dirt on one's shoe to a particular piece of ground, I suppose._

Katja's eyes widen in suprise. "I see." She holds the cards more carefully. "I'd still be careful around the cubes. I've heard some wild tales that will give me nightmares for a while." She gives a half smile, and orders a vodka from the servitor-bot.

> (OOC) Doc says, "going to work him for more details?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "if not, we'll move to Remus and Menocal"

Katja _Anything else, guys? I'm ready for a drink._

_Drink all you like,_ Remus replies. _Maybe they'll say more. But try not to let out anything else about our merry band of dissidents._

_Like I'd really want to go on about all of you,_ Kat murmurs.

> (OOC) Katja says, "Guess I'm done."

---

> (OOC) Doc checks Menocal for life!

> (OOC) Menocal is live sorta

> (OOC) Doc says, "sounds like you are doing a straightforward networking check. Pick your crowd and roll 'em"

> (OOC) Doc says, "if you have skills of interest (Kinesics, Interests, Art, etc.) apply those as complementary, or use them if better"

> (OOC) Menocal pulls up sheet

> (OOC) Doc says, "convincingly posed party animal behavior, given the nature of Kronos, is good for a further +10"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "OK. Networking: Criminals; in a dance club so that would probably be Art: Dance and Interest: Hot Dance Clubs. But first, an Art: Fashion roll as stated"

> (OOC) Menocal rolls 1d100 vs. 50 for 32 (success, MoS 18)

> (OOC) Menocal says, "Menocal designed her dress. For partying. Fear."

> (OOC) Doc says, "good for +10 equipment bonus"

Menocal come out of the side room wearing a dress that is, uh, one might think of the term 'gownless evening straps'. "Well! Time to hit the clubs and see what shakes besides me." She takes a moment to pose fetchingly for the audience (well, okay, for Remus, Doc and Damon), and heads out to one of the clubs she found. Dancing happens, as does drinking, mild drug use, the usual things in a socialization aspect. She may not really guide the conversation, but she's a pretty good listener.

> (OOC) Menocal says, "so that's a total +20? Also, she's going to be buying drinks for people as part of her party animal behavior. :)"

> (OOC) Doc says, "go for it"

> (OOC) Menocal rolls 1d100 vs. 85 for 26 (exceptional success, MoS 59)

Low-gravity dance is an art form all its own. Stations with the size and mass to approximate standard Martian gravity encourage experimentation, and Menocal is nothing if not experimental.

> (OOC) Menocal also has Eidetic Memory, and anyone who wants to hang out in her sensorium in the tacnet can.

The people who hang in Rhea's black sky in their tin cans are enthusiastic users of any and all means of adjusting one's lifestyle chemically or electronically. Their dance clubs are excuses to work off the resulting energy, and they throw themselves into the affair with abandon. They don't talk much, but when they do it's usually without the usual restraints that sobriety offers.

For example, talk is going 'round the station that a cargo of infomorphs has docked - or been brought - and that they aren't simply aware of caches of Earth lore and culture, but _that they are from Earth_, just prior to the Fall. The rumor is that they, along with their possessions and homes, were digitally recorded and launched into space. Speculation is rampant as to how, when or where to get ahold of such individuals and convince them to share the cultural wealth.

Menocal passes this along to the team. This is useful... if terrifying.

More than once the cultural spelunker overhears groups of individuals - probably of the same or allied gangs - plotting to ambush spacers in the dock. A few are talking about knocking out the KPA's security apparatus on the Vine and conducting a mass sweep of incoming ships, or even raiding the cargo vaults near the docks.

_That is a heck of a carrot._ Menocal notes. _The amount that pre-Fall data could be worth..._ About the last, she muses, _and I may want to pass some of those plans along to the nominal heads._

> (OOC) Remus says, "Sweep... wait, these guys want to steal the cubes?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "if you were offered a box chock-full of Olde Earth Goodies, you would too. The stuff is hugely valuable"

> (OOC) Doc says, "To make it clear, this is along the lines of the Crips announcing that they're going to raid LA's harbor because crates of diamonds just came in. Their ability to talk about it is quite above their ability to actually DO it, though someone might organize them.."

> (OOC) Damon says, "Given our own perspective on the cubes, a better analogy might be crates of weapons-grade plutonium."

> (OOC) Doc says, "we're about to wrap, since you guys have found some Serious Business that might be actionable next time. any closing poses?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Not from me."

Damon is too prudish to tap into Menocal's sensorium directly, but he does pay attention to the filtered feed of flagged data that she's supplying. _We need to get this correlated on the Eye,_ he says. _These crazy kids aren't up to space piracy on their own, but if they find someone who is and start opening up a lot of cubes at once, it'd make Wilhab look like a firecracker._

Menocal's combination of mesh and memory has her filing the faces of the talkers away for later. With a few goodbyes of various types and intensity, she begins to make her way back to the ship, the 'dress' inflating to become a cloak that surrounds her. It's not always good to wander around like that. _I am coming back now. We should take it to KPA, because the last thing they want is amateurs trying something.. or worse, organized pros._

_Is that really a good idea? Getting KPA involved?_ Kat asks.

/Yes, I would be careful about that, _Damon interjects._ If the KPA get too curious about how much **we** know about the cubes, they could get very much in **our** way of this./

_Those kids didn't sound that serious,_ Remus says. _Still. Let's get it on the Eye. Maybe there's a back-channel to the KPA that will listen to this without shooting the messenger._

> (OOC) Doc says, "that sounds like a good closer."

_We don't mention the cubes, just that some of the gangs seem interested in possible cargo hijacking and messing with security. Partial truth is better than lying. The problem is that they might then find out the resons. But still, keep that in reserve., I think._ Menocal's in favor of a nice quiet time, instead of a firefight.

> (OOC) Doc says, "that sounds good too :)"

> (OOC) Doc says, "Basically I have a big data dump for you guys (next time) that'll lay out what you've learned in detail, and let you figure out where to go"

> (OOC) Doc notes: Rez - Damon - 5

> (OOC) Doc notes: Rez - Katja - 5

> (OOC) Doc notes: Rez - Menocal - 5

> (OOC) Doc notes: Rez - Remus - 5

> (OOC) Doc says, "that good?"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "yup!"
