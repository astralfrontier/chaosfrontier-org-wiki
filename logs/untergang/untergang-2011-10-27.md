> (OOC) --- Begin Paste From Damon ---

> (OOC) (OOC) Damon says, "OK, let's discuss what's going on, while Bill makes dinner."

> (OOC) (OOC) Damon says, "So apparently we've got more cubes coming into Kronos. We have options of (a) tracing them, (b) breaking into the ships in-dock, (c) space piracy i.e. breaking into the ships before we dock, (d) ? (e) PROFIT"

> (OOC) (OOC) Menocal says, "I'm pro-B; fewer chances to be shot at"

> (OOC) (OOC) Damon says, "We also can try to find out about that old-Earth infomorph card and see if we can find that satellite."

> (OOC) (OOC) Damon says, "We can also head for Jupiter and see if we can find out who hijacked that woman who tried to emigrate/escape."

> (OOC) (OOC) Katja says, "Don't forget that I owe some favors aboard some of the ships that carried cubes in. I'm not super stealth, but there's no reason I can't bring along Menocal as an assistant."

> (OOC) (OOC) Remus says, "Inspecting the old-Earth infomorphs, and tracing the cubes in dock, are my favorites."

> (OOC) (OOC) Damon says, "There's also no reason you can't let Menocal share your senses while you go physically alone."

> (OOC) (OOC) Remus says, "Also: trying to trace the ships back to their origins based on trajectories, sightings, etc."

> (OOC) (OOC) Katja says, "...That's true. I forget about this constant network thing in my brain. x.x"

> (OOC) (OOC) Katja says, "We were also planning on sending a mech to check out the wreckage of the ship that opened the cube."

> (OOC) (OOC) Damon says, "Lemme startlog for Bill and spam all that into it"

> (OOC) --- End Paste ---

> (OOC) Damon says, "Didn't know how paste works in a cambot room, but eh, the data's in."

> (OOC) Doc says, "A note on 'sneak around/attack ships in dock': preventing this is the whole point of the Kronos Port Authority, so you will need to outgun or outwit them."

> (OOC) Doc says, "'go in for repair work' will get you past the KPA's eyes, but put you under surveillance from the ship owners."

> (OOC) Doc says, "and I hope I've portrayed them as crafty enough bastards to make that seem moderately risky but worthwhile"

> (OOC) Damon says, "There's one of me, one of Katja, and a whole crapload of Ultimates in the KPA. We don't want to start a war with them."

> (OOC) Remus says, "We also asked our Firewall proxy to see if they can get us a back channel to the KPA."

> (OOC) Doc says, "I'd have had an answer for you today if I was ready to run. x.x"

> (OOC) Doc says, "work has been wall-to-wall spec meetings and onboarding"

> (OOC) Damon says, "So tonight's session will be "we PCs discuss our options, decide which ones we like best, and then Bill can prepare those things"."

> (OOC) Damon says, "Damon's a "hurt-people-and-break-things" specialist, but he's no slouch at Infiltration either. I think he favors trying to sneak into the docks and shadow an incoming cube."

> (OOC) Damon says, "For that mission, he'll load out for nonlethal and use his combat abilities primarily to escape unhurt if detected."

> (OOC) Remus says, "How about driving that remote out to the Saltwater Baptism wreckage?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "you aren't sure where the SB is - it disappeared - but another ship also wrecked, and THAT one you know about"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Assuming that it's not crashed into Jupiter or headed off the plane of the ecliptic at 80,000 kph."

> (OOC) Doc says, "you can send a remote out there easily enough"

> (OOC) Damon says, "We presumably have a last known trajectory for the SB, but it's probably more expensive in delta-v than it's worth compared with following a cube we /know/ is coming in."

> (OOC) Remus says, "How about tracing the origins of the cubes? Seems like pretty elementary computation."

> (OOC) Doc says, "describe the computation in detail"

> (OOC) Damon says, "We know (at least have official flight plans of) the origin points of the cubes we know about. It'll be some serious detective work trying to trace them back any further..."

> (OOC) Damon says, "I was on the understanding that they're from all over the damn place. Is that correct?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "Correct"

> (OOC) Remus says, "But there's only a handful of efficient, likely flight plans."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Suppose we know where a ship arrived. We can trace back in time to its first known point where it had the cube. From there, the ship has finite delta-vee; depending on how long it was in flight, we might know where it came from."

> (OOC) Doc says, "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary\_Transport\_Network"

> (OOC) Doc says, "it's identifying that 'first known point' which is the hard problem"

> (OOC) Remus oops

> (OOC) Doc says, "not like it matters, no real game tonight"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Still, it seems worth some effort, right? And it's perfect work for a minimally-supervised AI."

> (OOC) Damon says, "If the cubes have multiple points of origin en route to Kronos, if your hypothesis is that they have a single point of origin past that, you've got some serious detective work to do."

> (OOC) Doc says, "the only reason you guys have a list of incoming cube-bearing ships now is because your proxy bent a lot of Firewall hardware and bandwidth to that very problem, Remus. And all you have now is preliminary data. I'll describe the process of gathering that data if you want"

> (OOC) Doc says, "if you can improve on my description, you win a prize, which is faster access to data"

> (OOC) Doc says, "here goes. 1. you start with a physical description of the storage cube. 2. you make a list of known habitats in the system, sorting in ascending order by travel time to Kronos. 3. you send an AI to those habitats. 4. the AI sifts through spime and camera footage of the docks, public records, anecdotes and other stuff on the local mesh to establish ships likely to be carrying cubes ('map'). 5. it relays that data to some central collection point ('reduce'), or a set of nearby collection points, all of which will eventually reach you guys."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Let's discuss the other options first. I don't really want to to B&E in-dock or even on the way to dock. I don't think we'd make good pirates."

> (OOC) Doc says, "once you have that initial data, you correlate it with the ships' intended destinations. did they get there? were they seen dropping off a cube? if so, where did it go? Repeat the search from there."

> (OOC) Remus says, "OK. I get how expensive it is, it's not like people have to file a flight plan with the FAA, ICAO, or IAU anymore."

> (OOC) Doc says, "right. the algorithm is easy. it's just expensive"

> (OOC) Remus says, "OK. How about booting up the persona on the playing card? We've got at least one that doesn't seem likely to kill us."

> (OOC) Doc says, "the hints you've received suggest that they have some kind of post-hypnotic suggestion to infect whoever they can reach, but it's not clear how that works"

> (OOC) Doc says, "the most likely assumption is that there's some triggerable cache of virus out there, and affected infomorphs will somehow lead one to the other."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Hmm. That sounds like 'cross the streams' bad. :/"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Hell, the Old Earth satellite is one of the more blatant TITANbait. As much as I feel sorry for the kids, going dreding around in Earth's low orbits is asking for trouble."

> (OOC) Damon says, "dredging\*"

> (OOC) Doc says, "none of your options are awesome or obviously the best. that's the point."

> (OOC) Menocal says, "Also potentially fatal and stuff"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Well. The KPA back channel; Katja poking around; sending a drone to the wrecked ship; and shadowing an arriving cube, all sound less potentially fatal."

> (OOC) Remus says, "So is there any objection to doing all of those?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "none from me"

> (OOC) Doc says, "your proxy will keep doin her job and run the search in the background"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "sounds like a plan"

> (OOC) Katja says, "I'm down with that."

> (OOC) Doc says, "there you go then"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Damon's got an infiltration of 60, which isn't /bad/, but it's not great. I don't have any invis gear on me, and my Disguise skill (and any other "no really I'm supposed to be here" type skill) is pretty much crap."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Go buy some. Or barter for some."

> (OOC) Doc says, "find whoever's on the crew that's got good rep, a decent Networking score, and isn't out of favors."

> (OOC) Menocal says, "You can borrow my suit!"

> (OOC) Doc says, "there you go"

> (OOC) Damon says, "/That/ works too. Unless /you/ want to do the infiltration, and I follow behind at a discreet distance."

> (OOC) Damon says, "With me serving as your insurance policy if you get into a situation you can't talk your way out of."

> (OOC) Menocal says, "Also, Menoca's infiltration is only 50, but she's got chameleon skin, prehensile feet, enhanced hearing and vision, mnemonic aug, and a covert ops tool."

> (OOC) Doc says, "you're in good shape for it then"

> (OOC) Damon says, "I don't suppose there are any hypercorps trying to make a cred out in these wild parts?"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "OK then. I will infiltrate, Damon will back up. Anyone want to go for a ride while I'm at it?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "you won't find hypercorps active here very much, at least not alone. the KPA is the closest thing to one. but they can be found."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Doc can come along"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Actually. Heh. If the KPA were to count as sufficiently hypercorp-like, Damon might actually be the best guy to do the back-channel. 55 c-rep and skill of 55 with Networking: Hypercorps. On a success, I might be able to find a friend of a friend of an old security-corp buddy who'll take an anonymous tip and trust me enough not to drag me in."

> (OOC) Doc says, "now you're cookin with gas"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Also I'm thinking we do the back-channel /after/ we try shadowing a cube. "There are mysterious dangerous cubes coming in" is useful, but "There are mysterious dangerous cubes coming in and one of them went thataway" is even more useful. Though we run the risk of KPA storming in, confiscating the cube, and letting the Cenobites out."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Agreed."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Can I watch without hitching a ride?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "you can watch recorded XP later, you can have XP broadcast in realtime over your tactical network, you can send a beta fork, you can do all kinds of things."

> (OOC) Menocal can design the watching program for you! :)

> (OOC) Damon says, "Y'know, Menocal, I'm pretty sure the ID Crew didn't all have big curly black mustaches."

> (OOC) Remus says, "I'd rather watch the XP in realtime, if it isn't likely to compromise the infiltration."

> (OOC) Doc says, "alright. any other business?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "I think this should give us enough to figure out if it's time to commit, or run like hell."

> (OOC) Menocal says, "and punt to the real terrifying experts that they have on staff"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Yeah. If we find a real problem, we won't be the only ones on the Global Frequency."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Anything else we should cover?"

> (OOC) Damon says, "I think I'll have enough to keep me busy next session."

> (OOC) Menocal says, "I think we're good for now"

> (OOC) Doc says, "go ahead and stoplog then. you guys will get some bonus rez for good planning here"

> (OOC) Doc says, "(whichi will be awarded in 2 weeks)"
