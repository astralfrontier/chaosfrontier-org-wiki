The Vine provides good social cover for people interested in skulking about and shadowing cargo: anything that looks remotely valuable, interesting, and not nailed down can expect at least five pairs of eyes on it at all times. More if you count the dock's ubiquitous surveillance apparatus.

> (OOC) Menocal says, "I'm in the bar?"

Menocal has the advantage of foreknowledge, courtesy of the system-wide investigation that's been performed on the group's behalf. She's able to devise a schedule that puts her 'coincidentally' at the unloading of a ship carrying one of the mystery cubes. This craft, the _Shizuka Maru_, is typical of long-haul cargo craft that move between inner and outer systems. It has no sleeved crewmembers. The crew reinstantiate themselves in locally rented 'morphs.

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 30 for 31 (failure, MoF 1)

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 80 for 10 (exceptional success, MoS 70)

> (OOC) Remus says, "That's either really good for us or really bad."

Doc comes over the tacnet, indicating the ship. "Regrettably the few people aboard this ship were too busy with virtual entertainment to attend to their security. The _Shizuka Maru_'s crew will be meeting with Banana Grip soon. I have a small window of opportunity before the ID Crew scans the ship's mesh and notices me. Do you have any requests?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Or both."

Menocal thinks a moment. "Can you get the inventory?"

Remus watches through the VX channels. "If you leave a Delta to keep an eye on things, is there a chance they won't see it?

There's a pause. "Internal inventory records are available, including crew annotations," Doc reports. "I can leave a prepared, self-erasing delta behind." On the party's HUDs, records begin filing in - the ship is apparently smuggling samples of Venusian genetic engineering, assorted debris from Earth orbit, and other inner-system rarities.

Remus looks quickly over the 'orbital debris'. "Dangerous place to go trolling," he mutters. "Have to wonder if they didn't make a dive into NEO and risk a clash with TITANS. Can we get their navigational logs too and confirm or deny?"

"This will be my last inquiry," remarks Doc. More data streams in. The ship has some sort of stealth capability - its smart-matter hull has been specially designed to absorb radar waves, scatter ladar, muffle infrared, and so forth. There's even evidence that it handles stellar occlusion gracefully - not enough to fool an astronomer's telescope, but good enough for anything short of that. As a result, it has been known to perform acts of piracy on scum barges, automated cargo haulers, and the like; it also fares well against the kill-sats around earth.

> (OOC) Remus says, "Well THAT'S nicely inconspicuous."

Katja looks over the ship data. "Nice. She's built for pirating. I bet I could get a nice commision by letting a few friends know where this ship is now."

Menocal says, "Leaking it might not be a bad idea, later. "

"That's not all she's built for," Remus adds. "I mean, bloody hell. For stealth ship it's pretty damn conspicuous. You don't use something like this for milk-runs." He zips back over to the Vine's public mesh. "We might not be the only one watching her. But then, with Banana Grip on the way, maybe people will be suddenly uninterested."

Menocal says, "Their internal security is probably fairly tight; we should avoid trying to get on board."

> (OOC) Doc says, "aand here we go!"

Banana Grip is wearing a different morph than the crew remembers. This in itself isn't surprising. The synths with him are the same, though, and Menocal and the others watch the familiar process of a storage cube being unloaded as cargo.

---

Menocal makes it as far as another part of the Vine. Cubes - dozens of them - are being loaded into a SLOTV, similar to the _Alexander Nevsky_. Rather than an inter-habitat or intraplanetary shuttle, this one looks built more specifically for moon landings. Moons such as Rhea, around which Kronos orbits. Menocal's senses relayed to Katja allow the pilot to confirm: the ship is undoubtedly set up to ferry the cubes to somewhere on Rhea itself. Once it launches, the pursuit can continue.

> (OOC) Doc says, "You can try to sneak aboard, take the Nevsky down, get ahold of a third ship, or do something else."

> (OOC) Doc says, "bonus points if you guys are crazy awesome enough to hijack that stealth ship. :3"

> (OOC) Doc says, "I'll also accept re-entry surfing."

> (OOC) Katja says, "How many are on the crew for the stealth ship?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "3"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Remind me, where have we heard of Rhea before?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "it's a moon of Saturn."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Gall Force? :D"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Cute. :)"

> (OOC) Doc says, "you guys are over it."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Oho."

> (OOC) Katja says, "I'm sure they have drones. You can't protect a ship like that with such a small crew. The only way to even think about taking the ship would be to take over their systems, and then take out the crew."

> (OOC) Doc says, "if only you'd slipped some sort of logic bomb in earlier, like a deltaaaaahoy!"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Take off every Doc. For great justice."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Can I ask the group an obvious question?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "you can ask em whatever."

> (OOC) Katja says, "What would we do with a second ship? Sell it? Keep it?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Give it to Firewall?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "sell it, keep it, ooor another option: lift the chameleon software and nano specifications from their computer, then tell the Nevsky's systems to copy it. it's all just code. :3"

Katja queries the net to see if there is any kind of bounty on ye old pirate ship.

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 55 for 25 (exceptional success, MoS 30)

A few minutes, while cubes are loaded, gives Katja some inner-system leads that might be willing to pay for information about a sneaky ship. While nobody has fingered the _Shizuka Maru_ as such, Kronos' mesh has definitely received bounty offers from around the system that match its M.O.

"Maybe we can barter that information," Remus says, "for some information about where she's been going and where she's been picking up. But it seems that the stronger lead is to follow this lander down to Rhea. Hmm..." He pulls up a map of local space. "That stealth tech would really help if we wanted to follow them. Think we should... acquire it?"

Menocal says, "Yes."

Menocal says, "They're using it for deeply unpleasant things. We should fix that."

> (OOC) Remus says, "I like this plan. I'm excited to be apart of it. What's the name of this SLOTV, and when does it leave?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "the unnamed ID Crew ship will probably leave on some schedule, you're not sure what. It's not broadcasting any IFF or identity."

> (OOC) Doc says, "in this scenario, you probably want to point a spime at it and hoof it back to Nevsky, borrow+disable the Shizuka Maru's stealth, and be ready to take off."

> (OOC) Katja says, "I like that plan."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Do eet."

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. volunteers to pose through doing so, speak up and get to it"

> (OOC) Doc says, "Delta Doc will erase itself after the operation."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Seeing no other volunteers, I'll do so."

> (OOC) Menocal was working on it

> (OOC) Remus says, "Oh. Go ahead then. o\_o"

> (OOC) Remus says, "You're the better writer."

Menocal begins the process of building the spime to watch and build a bridge for Docta to snag the stealth componentry of the ID Crew ship. It's not very hard in this situation, and since there's an internal process, that makes it easier. There's enough hard connections to sneak something through to let the information move through, disguised as a ... hmm, yes, a routine process checking fuel prices in the Saturn system, that should do nicely if anyone does a simple query on 'what are you'.

> (OOC) Doc says, "if you got more, keep it rollin. go all the way to blastoff :)"

Menocal gives the 'all-back' call, while keeping a link through the spime open to Docta (yes, that's what she's calling the Delta of Doc) to listen in for the takeoff countdown. She also wants to have a look at the code for the stealth system, in case she can try to smuggle a spike onto the system to turn it off at a particularly fortuitous time... or pass the activation code to one of Katya's friends.

> (OOC) Menocal now waits for everyone else to 'get back on board'.

> (OOC) Menocal says, "...unless I was the only one not on board. x/x"

> (OOC) Doc says, "assume that they do, and continue."

> (OOC) Damon is barely following this, but I think I have enough to keep up.

Menocal checks the spime again for traffic, then sits back. "If I can get a triggered spike on board, you can sell that information to someone, Katya, and then they can use that to shut down the stealth, maybe in backdoor in and shut the ship down." She grins. "Surprise is an excellent weapon." Then she turns back to the code. She also shares this with Doc (for his programming expertise and the fact that it's part of him sending the data) so they can work together on it.

"We should also send a ping to our assigned proxy," Remus says. "In case we disappear again. I'm rather attached to this sleeve."

> (OOC) Doc says, "alright. assume you guys fire a status update to your proxy."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Remus, pose doin so."

> (OOC) Menocal says, "Basically, Menocal is using the delta of Doc to open a hole in the wall, smuggle the code for the stealth system out to us marked as a different and far more boring program, and also see if there's a good shot to put in something to shut the stealth system on their ship off. If it can be set off by someone else, we can sell them that information for when those people decide to strike. Makes sense?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "That's fine. Menocal, pose successfully doin so. you can code in a kill code."

Menocal , with the help of Doc, patches into the ID Crew ship a kill-code for the stealth system so they can shut it off remotely with a series of codes. The codes are recorded carefully in memory, and she turns back, smiling with a job-well-done look. "And there we go. We have their stealth plans, theirs have a spike in it to shut it off when I or someone else wants to. Now I want some pudding."

> (OOC) Katja says, "We could make quite a bit of money on that, actually. Who says we have to only sell it to one person?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "very good. :)"

> (OOC) Doc says, "the Rhea shuttle will leave soon. pose noticing and following"

Menocal says, "You know people who'd like this, Katya. May want to feel them up. Out. Feel them out."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Katja will have no trouble plugging the stealth logic into Nevsky's nanomachines, though it will take time to replicate through the superstructure. It'll be ready to go by the time you guys are."

Menocal tilts her head suddenly. "Ping! Ship leaving! I asked the station mesh to let me know when it happened."

Katja grins. "Good job. That spike should get up enough for at least a refuel at some point." She loads up the stolen stealth code, and gets the engines warm to take off as soon as the shuttle makes a move.

> (OOC) Doc says, "and here we go"

Katja undocks and slowly starts out on a course toward the moon. After setting in a course, she asks her muse to make a list of bounties on the ship to cross reference with her contacts.

Remus is more worried about what they'll find when they get... where? Somewhere on Rhea? "What can they get down there, that they can't get out here?" he wonders.

Menocal says, "Absolutely no observers for crate transfers?"

_Nevsky_ is able to trail the unnamed and unknown Rhea-bound shuttle without too much difficulty. There's evidence of some kind of tight-beam communication from a ground station, but of course there's no hope of intercepting that. The shuttle sets down near a crude cluster of habitats on the barren surface of the moon. Long-range optics show spacesuited figures, robots, and other signs of activity. And one more detail: a quantum farcasting antenna. A few minutes of sighting gives its destination as Pandora.

Katja says, "It makes a nice drop site. Out of the way enough to store goods without being noticeable, but close enough to the station to get backup, and use as a distribution hub. I'd be suprised if the boxes are the only thing down there."

> (OOC) Damon says, "I vaguely remember something about the TITANs leaving via the Pandora gaes."

> (OOC) Doc says, "yeah"

Katja whistles when she sees the antenna. "Don't see one of those every day."

> (OOC) Doc says, "... with millions of forcibly uploaded human minds"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Really."

Menocal says, "...Remus. Call this in. NOW." She sounds terrified. "Pull us up so this doesn't get recorded, but call this in now. No matter what happens, this needs to be recorded."

> (OOC) Remus says, "What's on Pandora?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "a wormhole under human control, basically. a stargate."

> (OOC) Doc says, "wholly operated, if not owned, by the Gatekeeper Corporation. the Commonwealth of Titan, the Planetary Consortium, and other big political noises have a stake in it"

Katja shivers when she sees the destination of the transmission. "...Anyone else feel like calling in the military, or is that just my old instincts coming out? What I would give for a fleet of fighter drones right now..."

Remus nods. "Right." He finds a communications laser to get a message out to the proxy, and keeps it streaming their telemetry in short bursts at semi-random intervals of about a minute. "Should we send forks down there?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "you can land, or drop remote-operated drones down there if you have some."

> (OOC) Doc says, "and/or resleeve and drop, if you think you can get back up again"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Wait. I remember reading that the Commonwealth had control of one of the only Pandora gates in the outer systems. Should this really be that disturbing?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "to summarize: the storage cubes apparently contain Exsurgent-infected infomorphs. they are apparently beaming these to Pandora."

> (OOC) Remus says, "I don't know. :/ Remus talks fancy but is kind of provincial and not a tactician."

> (OOC) Remus says, "That sounds bad, and almost certainly is."

> (OOC) Remus says, "But I'm unclear on why."

> (OOC) Doc says, "At this point you guys have enough of a picture that you can punt to a more combative Firewall team. You can stick around and act as backup if you want. You can go in if you want. You guys must choose how best to use yourselves and your assets."

> (OOC) Doc says, "This is definitely the sort of shit that calls for a strike team."

"This is all being a little beyond me," murmurs Damon. "Even I can tell that there is a bad and dangerous thing happening here, but can someone explain in simple words how bad this can be?"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Panora is a planet? I thought the gates just go to another system or something?"

"I can," offers Doc quietly.

> (OOC) Doc says, "Pandora is a shepherd moon. The only thing of note there is the Pandora Gate, though."

> (OOC) Doc says, "allow Doc to sum up :)"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Considering how there are supposed to be at least 5, yeah, I'm curious. n.n"

"During the Fall, the TITANs were known to forcibly upload millions of living humans. Their automata on Earth still perform this function, according to the Firewall records I've been perusing. Some teams have watched their friends beheaded by flying robots. It seems that the mechanisms the TITANs put in place to ensnare humans have not completely broken down. I believe we are witnessing another one."

Menocal says, "Mass kidnapping by insane, virus-generating and -laden artificial intelligences."

Doc nods. "Somehow - perhaps at Wilhab, perhaps elsewhere - infomorphs are modified to release samples of the Exsurgent virus. In this way, the contagion spreads itself. The cubes come to Kronos. Those that did not destroy or reprogram the ships carrying them are sent to Pandora, and presumably then sent through the Gate there. Whether the same is happening at the other four Gates in the system, or whether Pandora itself has been taken over, we do not know."

Katja says, "But humans are involved in this. Someone is orchestrating this."

Remus says, "Has anyone got a good hypothesis on why the Titans would send uploaded humans through the gates? Especially subverted ones?"

"The question has been considered at length," replies Doc. "To my knowledge there was no good answer, either during the Fall or now."

Katja says, "Part of their cleansing plan, most likely. Rid the system of the plague they consider humans."

"We will not solve this mystery here today," Damon says. "Not unless they steal us too and send our minds out to wherever they are sending minds, and this is not the way I wish to learn the truth. Today we must begin to figure out how to stop them from this."

> (OOC) Doc says, "so yeah. The Big Questions (why do it?) are unanswered. but hopefully that gives you guys the big picture here"

> (OOC) Doc says, "there's still plenty of unknowns too"

Remus sits quietly. "Would that be so awful, I wonder. Still. Whatever choices we make, there's millions of people going through there, who haven't been given one." He stares at the telescope photo of the farcaster array. "I'd like to go down there. But I won't if the rest of you don't want me to."

Doc thinks a moment. "I recall that we were told we'd uploaded ourselves as infomorphs... to think, if we'd proceeded with that plan, that might be us out there." He coughs, then grins. "It was clearly then not my idea."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Crap"

Menocal says, "We might be able to crash the farcaster and give time for real combatants to show up."

> (OOC) Katja says, "I am really not sure how to change that to an OOC comment."

> (OOC) Doc says, "just delete it"

> (OOC) Katja says, "What's the command for that?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "'viewlast #10' shows me it's line 139. 'deleteline 139' will delete it"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Thanks. Hadn't seen the syntax before."

> (OOC) Damon says, "Absent the third-person reference, Katja, it looks like it's a good IC pose."

Katja says, "We're not set up as a forward team. The most we could do is provide backup, but even then, we're not really suited to take this on. I'm going to capture as much of this as I can to send back to my contacts on Titan, though. Should cause quite the stir."

> (OOC) Doc says, "sounds good then."

> (OOC) Doc says, "you guys going to phone home and back off to watch the fireworks then? and/or put a dent in that farcaster?"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Can we tell what kind of defences they have?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Denting the farcaster might give our position and give them advance warning. I say no."

> (OOC) Doc says, "no defenses downstairs that you can see. You'd guess that the KPA will lock their killsats on you - if they can - and/or send ships. how much do you trust this new stealth system?"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "Let's get one question answered first: is there a local mesh at all, or does the farcaster have an accessable address."

> (OOC) Doc says, "finding that out will expose you as you'd have to radiate something down at the habitat cluster."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Trust something just installed and as of yet untested? Hell no."

> (OOC) Doc says, "but you're 99.99% sure they have SOME kind of mesh down there"

> (OOC) Doc says, "it's like asking if cities have cars."

> (OOC) Doc says, "you can try to relay through something else, like Kronos itself, a satellite you launch, another ship, etc."

> (OOC) Menocal says, "right. so we can't really do a reasonable listen-in to local traffic passively, we need to be active, which would be BAD."

> (OOC) Katja says, "I was just wondering if there's a way to launch a drone that can retransmit to us in a way that won't be immediately traceable."

Menocal says, "Let's be quiet little fishies, and swim away from the sharks and towards the reef where we can find the anemone that doesn't attack us."

> (OOC) Doc says, "drop a drone into low Kronos orbit, and have it point a laser at you. they'll know SOMETHING is nearby but you can blow it up before they triangulate"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Better than nothing. What do you think?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "We did buy a bunch of automechs."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Could we drop one? Rhea isn't that big, it might be able to soft-land easily."

> (OOC) Remus says, "I think we should go with it. I don't want to not know what's down there."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Something that small should be able to pass through any kind of sensor grid, too."

Damon rubs his chin. "This we should do, but not yet. We should be able to learn more if we are careful and do not risk our true persons. Perhaps machines with our forks that can beam back a report and suicide when they are caught."

> (OOC) Doc says, "alright. you hope to just knock out the farcaster, or more ambitious plans?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Knocking out the farcaster should be the last thing we do, after we've figured out if there's anything going on down there that for whatever reason we don't want to disturb."

> (OOC) Katja says, "We need to know more about this. Is this just at this gate, or is this happening at all of them? How deeply invested in this is the Gatekeeper Corps? The gate on its own isn't the threat. It's /how/ they're using it. We need to know who 'they' are."

> (OOC) Doc says, "sounds good. pose a wrap for now and we'll find that out next time!"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "Agreed. Delta forks running remotes to look at things."

> (OOC) Damon says, "I think we've got a plan."

Katja leans back in her chair and contemplates the scene below. "We need to do some serious recon on this. And we need Firewall to extend the search to the inner system. Is this only happening here, or at all the gates? Who is involved? This is organized. We need to find out who, why, and where. We already have a good idea 'what', and that's obviously 'how'.

> (OOC) Doc says, "sounds good! anything else?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "I think we should send betas, not deltas. Otherwise, yes."

> (OOC) Katja says, "I'd like to leave myself a note somehow about our plans before we begin, so if we get blown away and resleeved, there's a way to find out what happened before it all went to hell."

> (OOC) Remus says, "That is fine."
