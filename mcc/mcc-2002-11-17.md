The world is black. Not the reassuring, comforting darkness of the shadows, but all consuming darkness. And the pain. Soreness, it hurts to lay on your back. And then the memories return. Stalking through the gloom toward home. Home being the most recent place to hide. And then some armored, capable thugs hit you like a ton of bricks. No matter where the shadows lead, there they were. And then all was dark. A thunderous slam breaks the rolling tide of memories, a blinding light from above. "Good morning," Some unfamiliar voice calls from the light.

DarkGlow blinks through the glare and tries to sit up -- an action which, not coincidentally, would create a patch of shadow beneath him. Useless words of bravado are swallowed before they reach his tongue, and he says simply, "And you are?" in a tone that's nothing but bitter.

No shadows. The room, after a moment, is white. So white it's almost like an operating room, sterile and clean. The shadow-manipulater sits on a metal table, not restrained. Standing at the closed door is a suited man with a cart beside him. "That is not important." He gestures to the cart beside him. "Would you like something to drink? Or perhaps you're hungry? You might want to replinish your body's nurishment; you've been out a while, Mr. Glade. First name Daniel."

DarkGlow swallows past a dry thoats as he feels his heart speed a bit -- he can't sense a shadow _anywhere_. How in hell did this happen to him? Nevertheless, he stares cooly at the suit and tells him, "I'll pass."

The man nods his head. "Right." DarkGlow takes notice of the fact he's in a hospital gown. "You might feel a little soreness along your back; common after operation. It should be gone within a few hours."

DarkGlow looks away, fighting an urge to strangle the man with his bare hands. The action would almost certainly decrease his odds of survival, not increase them. Even so, holding himself still is difficult, but the trace of humour in the thought, _Been a while since I've done that...._ helps. His voice is tight as he asks, "Operation?"

A nod. "You see, you were hired to kill a man by the alias of 'Smoke', three weeks ago. Smoke was an operative of someone important. Instead of making you a dirty smear on some wall, he decided to let you take Smoke's place."

DarkGlow says, "Perhaps you've heard the expression, 'Don't shoot the messenger.'? I just delivered the message -- I think you should be discussin your differences with my employer, not me."

A wave of his hand. "That has allready been taken care of. Now, it's time to re-hire the messenger. Those with abilities such as yours, and Smoke's, are not easy to come by." He casually reaches over, playing with the handle of the cart. "You have attached to your optic nerves an incredibly small camera. This camera picks up the images which are being transmitted to your brain. The cameras relay the information to a station where the images are monitered. The cameras cannot be removed without destruction of the optic nerve, or intense surgery with high chance of vision loss." He smiles lightly. "You are now an operative."

DarkGlow says, "How wonderful! Is the instant replay feature included, or is it one of those pricey extras?" his voice is as dry as his wit, though for very different reasons. "Say, is this were we get to negotiate my price?"

"Sure," He says just as dry. "Why don't we start with the price of your life. Very valuable, but the stock can drop very fast. You see, that wasn't the only surgical advancement. Quite a few dozen nanites were introduced to your spine, where they attached. As well was a recepter anchored to the nervous branch just beneath the stem of your brain. These together allow your reflexes to move much faster. A benefit. Now, for the downside. Those images are monitored, and near by a switch. The more that switch is turned, the faster those nanites begin to vibrate, and produce a subsonic resonance. At its' highest setting, the vibrations shatter your spine. And no doubt, the shards of bone relocate into near vital organs. Resulting in a slow, painful death. Sorry, no new sleek model."

Fear and anger grind even the modest humour down. This... this was unbelievable. DarkGlow's mind spins wildly like an engine slipped out of gear and racing towards breakdown. How... how could this...? It's all gone... NightStar, could she.... No, coudln't be. My life, it's over.... This was all too mu-- And then it stops. Dead, you might say, the engine's ignition cut. Bleakness seeps into his skull, blacker than it has ever tainted him before. "Fine." His eyes cut up sharply, implaing the man as his shadows couldn't not--for the moment--do. "So be it." There was no fear in his eyes, no anger in his face. "So mote it be." Just murder--death, black and pure. "The target -- who and what is he?" Many deaths, probably, a line stretching out into the future. But it would end, with this man and his fellows. That he knew. And should he end with it, then they would all end together. So be it. So mote it be.

He doesn't seem startled. "You will not be required twenty four seven. Whenever something threatens an associate, or needs retrieving, you are one of few who will be dispatched. For the moment," He reaches into the shelf in the cart, producing a picture. He lifts it for DarkGlow's vision. It's the picture of a man with asian descent. "This is Lydon Yamaguchi, head of the Yamaguchi Corporation. He will be giving an announcement tomorrow in Renaissance Plaza. We believe there may be a danger to him. You will be in the crowd, and if there is some threat, you will come to his assistance. Not kill him."

DarkGlow says, "His... 'assitance'? What sort of game are you playing? Are you government or something?"

He sets the picture on top of the cart. "That really isn't important. Let's just say the pyramid goes high." A gesture to the lights along the walls. "Your clothes and possessions we found on you are in this cart. In two minutes, all but one light will be turned off. You are to slip from the building, to outside." Without further notice, he opens the door, and walks out, closing it behind him.

"Assistance?" DarkGlow mutters. "Who the hell has gotten their hooks into me? And so damn literally, too..." He stands, winces at the pain. _Soreness, my ass...._ He slips into his uniform, not checking to see if his gear is still intact--there'll be time for that later. And then he waits... for the shadows to return.
