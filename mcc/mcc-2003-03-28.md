Blackness, silence, blissfulness. The easing waves, the chaos, jumbled thoughts. Shattered like a golfball through a window is that ever seducing darkness by an incessent **Sound**. _Ring. Ring. Ring._

Thomas's fumbling hand searches around his nightstand aimlessly, guided by instinct. Grasping for whatever will disable the sound, or at least muffle it..

He's searching, and in instinct he finds it, and does what you do with the object. _Click._ "Hello?" Chirps out a voice, which sounds foggy in the cloak of grogginess. Oh. It's a phone.

"... What?" asks Tom without patience or consciousness. The act of speaking wakes him up just a bit, in itself. "..Hello? Yes?"

"Tommy!" Chris's chipper tone skips out. "I woke you up, didn't I?" She asks, now sounding a little hesitant.

"....S'okay. What's up?" Tom manages to mumble. He raises one hand, now conscious that he's still wearing his costume's black gloves, though the rest of him is normal. He sits up in bed, trying self-consciously to tug them off one at a time while cradling the phone to his ear.

"Oh, hey! I thought I had ask to meet today! But maybe I forgot." A glance at the clock earns that it's 11:28. Chris has been known to be a morning person - odd, considering how much of a night owl Tom can be. "I forgot to ask you somethin'; one of my friends is going to be singing at this club, later today, and I was wondering if you'd want to come with me to see? It's an open mike thing."

"... Absolutely... I'll be there," replies Tom, growing more awake. He hunts around for a clock, and sighs. "Sorry, I just conked out for a bit.. no worries. What time and where?"

"It'll be at seven o'clock, at... oh, hold on." The sound of papers ruffling in the background, "Ah, here it is! Images. It's right across from Kinkos, where we went a few weeks ago for you to copy your notes for that study group discussion."

".. Right. I'll be there, count on it," promises Tom, pausing for a moment to consider the intersection of times with his fellow 'unsanctioned investigators'. He shrugs after a moment, deciding instead to commit to this, no matter what. There's plenty he can do in the meantime. Flashing seconds take no time at all, and he continues on the phone. "See you then?"

"I'll be there. If I'm not outside, we've allready gotten a table. See you, sleepy head," She teases.

Thomas hangs up and slumps back into bed, already (against his will) reviewing his to-do list for the day. Read more on assembly-language programming; review LCD and video equipment from Mause's catalog; armor maintenance; create radio transmitters; study Progressive Anatomy..

After working an hour or so on a project for a class, Tom heads down to the DMV. The mystery of that man in the car wreck, who had been speaking to a member of the New Purple Gang was still unsolved. Two hours later, Tom has the name: Richard Samples.

The phone book is taken this time. There are atleast ten Samples in the phonebook, but only one Richard. The address is an expensive townhouse in downtown MC, phone number listed beside.

Tom finds the house, and has a little trouble getting to the box. Not that it's difficult, but there's a man trimming the bushes outside. He eventually leaves, but as Tom opens the box, it seems a little complicated. The electrician must have been a little eccentric. While trying to tap the phone, he seems to be unable to get it, on the first try.

After observing the electrical workings, using his observational powers, Tom catches the little trick that kept him from doing it. Apparently the electric company had updated their equipment, a small box on the inside just beneath the wires. Closer observation earns the fact this is for telemarketers and unwanted calls. It simply is bypassed.

After taking care to bury his improvised tap well under the surface, Tom turns his peculiar sense inwards, focusing on the apartment itself - scanning for occupants, primarily. He hides himself as well as he can, mindful that the concentration required may leave him vulnerable to notice..

As it turns out, no one is home.

The house seems rather in order. Other then the fact it seems like the individual who lives here has enough money to throw around to have a very comfortable home, it's nothing grand. An expensive townhouse, infact. There is a safe, but it seems all that is inside is money and a necklace. There is a desk, though rather neat.

After a careful rifling through of the desk, it's apparent that Richard is someone high up. He has a drawer full of papers regarding his investments, which happens to be for the Greymalkin Corporation.

Old tax papers, the last one dating back two years ago, suggests that Richard is a stock holder in Grymalkin, having invested quite a lot here and there. Also he owns a small business, a fast food franchise outside of the city limits. The day planner is achieved, and it seems like his schedule is booked with discussions between Greymalkin himself, someone named "Carmine", and various other meetings, one with a Michigan congressman, and a note to call about social security and his massose. It would appear he's taking a trip, conveniently beginning next week.

Having decided that's well enough, Tom heads home. First a stop by the DMV to get the second liscence number, the owner one Bernard Kiniwatz. Then collecting the electronics equipment, he showers, cleans up, and kills time until heading on to Images.

Jacket on, hair the proper color, shades off, Tom walks toward the rendezvous full of confidence, his usual college-boy persona firmly intact again. Despite his grim work at night (and sometimes during the day), neither part of his life is the "real thing" to him, and enjoying a night out with his lovely lady-friend is just as enjoyable, and just as important, as satisfying his own need for a just society one offender at a time.

Christina is outside. She's gussied up in a nice outfit of a silky dark skirt that while not too shirt, is flirty due to it being almost see through from lower half down, and a yellow top. "Tommie!" She calls, waving beside Brinda, Maranda and Leon.

There's a bit of chitchat, before long the decision is made to head on in for a good table. And a good table indeed, the second row! Brinda is obviously nervous. She's glancing around, smiling and frowning and looking at the stage nervous. The show begins.

Thomas gives a confident smile and thumbs-up, offering whatever silent encouragement his face and body language can. He sits back, letting himself simply enjoy the experience. Everybody needs some time off, after all...

The club itself isn't fantastic, obviously this is some promotional thing. The stage isn't enormous, and there is not much of a DJ booth, but its a club none the less. The show begins with a little comedy from the house man, who is only on for five minutes. It breaks the tension. The second is an older man with a guitar who pours his heart into that instrument, pulling an old Johnny Cash song. While the music isn't fitting the audiance, he definetly gets applause. "Well, here I go," Brinda says nervously, and with Chris's reassuring palm-touch, the woman goes on up.

Thomas sits back, smiling briefly at Chris and nodding. "She'll be great," he says conversationally, low enough to be heard without interrupting, and with that his attention returns to the stage. Idly he considers what little he knows about music theory, but those thoughts are forcibly pushed aside. No more analysis tonight; concentrate on entertainment!

Chris grins a little. "She's been excited all day," She intones quietly. Brinda mounts the stage, and takes up place before the microphone. The nervousness melts into a voice of talent. She's not made for the stage just yet, but there's raw potential in those vocals. Choosing a sad, soft song by a band popular a year ago, Brinda goes. Three minutes later, the applause bring her a great smile, and she returns, flustered, to the table.

Thomas joins in the applause, smiling brightly and cheering as loudly as civil behavior permits. "Well done," he remarks, saluting. Idly he looks to Chris, then at the other faces near him, curious what else is to come and gauging interest in staying or leaving. After all, this isn't so bad..

The comedian takes the stage again. "Ladies and Gentlemen, we here at Images would like to thank all those who come, and if you show up again next week, we'll have a panel of judges here to see if we can start hiring you as regular acts. But now," He says, holding up a card, "We're glad to welcome back the vocal stylings of a gentleman who wowed us earlier in the week. Please, put your hands together for the vocal stylings of the Musical Magician, Hamlin." A face made to smile slides up the stairs with liquid grace, decked out in a dark blue suit suited for a reptilian singer of the fourties.

Thomas applauds with the rest, assuming this next act is something more than the amateur-night acts the venue has been sporting through the evening.

"Mm." His eyes roam the audiance, "Now before I begin," One more comes that smile like a viper, "I'd like to see if anyone would be willing to... help me?" He draws down the stage, into the audiance. His voice allready aided by the microphone. "Just a lady to saronade?" All three of the women at the table shrink at the same time as lean forward. And he's coming toward Tom's table.

Thomas waits patiently, looking from face to face. His gender excuses him, but a flare of defensiveness rises as he considers some aging crooner trying to serenade his Chris.

He halts by the table, and sweeps a hand. "M'dear," Comes the Crooner's coo to Brinda, "You did a fine job up there. Sang about heartache, hmm? Would it be out of place, if I tried to soothe those heartstrings with a little melody?" A blush creeps up those cheeks, Chris and Maranda can only snicker and look. "I... sure! Why not..."

Thomas grins and sits back, privately relieved - and now able to fully enjoy the show. He nods supportively, smiling at the girl and watching to see how this unfolds.

Brinda slides on up out of her seat, and heads towards the stage. Hamlin claims a stool that was taken off for the comedian, and glides up those stairs with greased joints. He pats the stool, and Brinda hops on up. Back turned to the audiance, the tap of a shoe, a gesture to the DJ - nothing more then an efficent sound system - and a french horn tune rolls from the sound system.

"Ooooooh," Coos that voice into the loudspeakers as the tune picks up. "I siiiing for my supper, I call for the song," His voice draws out hauntingly to to the crowd as he draws around to face Brinda more, "But when I sing for you girl, I purr, all night long." He draws out in front, stepping to the edge of the stage as his hand swings out, "I say this, believe in me, because I realise just how much you have of money." A turn to her, soothing on off, "I don't care, you can shower me with riches, toss it to my feet, you can go ahead and start..." He draws to her other side, before his eyes sweep on over. "But I still will repeat, my desire comes right from my heart."

Brinda's eyes are intent, are following Hamlin across the stage. And she merely slips off a pretty, flimsy gold necklace from her neck, to toss it over to Hamlin. This he catches, but it seems that she's not the only one. One, two, three green bills get tossed up on the foot of the stage. Tom reaches for his wallet, infact. "Nothing too much, not something you can't spare," Hamlin intones over the speakers, as he draws on behind. "I'm not greedy, my wallet's not impaired. I sing for my supper, and I sing for you. I look at those eyes, deep in and I'm sold, to your feet, I do."

Tom throws up a ten, and doesn't think much about it. WIth one broad sweep, Hamlin cleans the stage of a good handfull of money, and rises. "I wouldn't care if that hair was spun of gold," The necklace wielding hand sweeps along the back of her scalp, blond streaks glinting through her hair as, indeed, her red hair shimmers with new gold fibers. "Or your skin made green." Again his hand brushes, once along her shoulder, the woad of bills looping and coiling. "It would be the same to me if it had would rust," The gold streaks turn dark, and blend in with her hair. "I'd peel away that pricy seam," Like gause the green is drawn off, "And care what's on the inside, you must trust." Both items of wealth gone, Hamlin glides back to her front. The music refrain draws on in, before he circles around to face her. "I look in those depths, and I see why I care, and I can't help but stare. Even if those pockets of mine do dispair, leeching from you I would not dare. Because I sing for my supper, I sing for the son

song." His voice draws out, compellingly haunting over the audiance as he looks back, "When I sing for you dear, I purr, All Night Loong." His arms weave as they have all through the song, like a pair of sleek serpents, fingers along the side of Brinda's neck. Then the music ends. A standing ovation.

And as the applause continues, Hamlin bows, and simply slips off stage.

The cheer residing after Hamlin's departure is still clinging. He seems to have touched a cord with everyone; the fact that the money is gone doesn't seem to strike anyone, and infact seems like... they did it on their own vocation. The next act goes on up, greeted with smiles warmed over. Brinda is still relatively glowing from that.

Tom escorts Chris and the others out, complimenting the budding songstress on her public debut, and encouraging her to go back. "Felt like a very friendly crowd," he remarks outside. "Everyone was pretty much on the same wavelength."

In the dark, Guy moves along the street, looking at one of the apartment buildings that lines the streets near the playground. It's near midnight, on a Friday night. The sound of music can be heard, blaring and booming.

Guy,now having his GUy face on, begins heading down the road from the playground. He glances about cautiously, keeping an eye out for trouble. The other one'll stay in his head, thank you very much. After taking a moment to try and figure out which apartment has the best view... as well as setting a point in time that he can return to, should he need to, he heads over to it to find a few people who hopefully, will be willing to talk.

Three men are loitering around the front of one of the building Guy is heading towards. Their voices carry over to guy, but almost as one they look over and just Take notice of him, eyeballing him for a minute.

Guy strides towards the loiterers, letting his footsteps fall into an easy, casual sort of stride. _They'll be helpful, I'm sure. Well... probably._ He glances over at the men, and offers them a nod in greeting once he's gotten a few feet closer.

"So, yeah. I wanted to bust his nose. But I like my job," Comments the one on the left to the other two. "I donno, you be getting some shit from yo boss still, that ain't right," Offers the right one. "Hey, man," The middle one calls to Guy.

Guy nods, "Hey there." His gaze drifts lazily about, taking in the scenery, as it were, while noting the three that stand in front of him. He addresses all three of them, "So how's it goin'? I'm wonderin' if you can help me out?"

The ages seem a variation; the middle looks closer to his thirties, while the right is closer to teens then twenties, and the left looks just under Right's. "Is a'ight," Left replies casually. "Namuch, man," Right returns. "How can we help ya?" Middle asks.

Guy shrugs, and lets his left foot tap a bit, while he says, "Well, I'm lookin' for a little bit of a history lesson. You guys been around here long?"

Right cocks his brow, and eyes Guy, while Middle stands up a little straighter. "I have, so's Leroy here," he slaps Left across the stomach and getting a shoulder punch in return.

Guy shrugs once more, "Well that's good t'know. I've been wonderin' about that playground over there. I understand there was some kind of shooting a few years back... any of you know about that?"

That causes a little bit of silence between the three of them. "I don't know nothin'," Leroy says as Middle gives him a look. "Not me, man," Right comments. Middle steps forward, standing a full head above Guy. "Wha'chyou lookin' for? Askin' round about that stuff fo?"

Guy raises an eyebrow. He looks up then, so as to address Middle. "Well, I'm workin' on somethin'. Tryin' to put together the pieces here, see if I can figure out what happened. I'm asking, because it's the sorta thing I don't know myself, and I need the info, 'cause I'm helping someone out. They lost someone in the shooting, wouldn't go into details, but, I owe her..."

"Leroy, go get me a soda." "Hey I-" "You heard me." He says a little firmly. Leroy nods his head, and heads on inside. Turning back, Middle eyes Guy a little. "Y'see, man, good people around hea, they don't like people askin' about stuff like that. Because generally, it's done by little shits who think with guns, y'know? Usually people who ask that kinda stuff are cops. And, while we don't disrespect no cops, makes some a little edgy, especially those that be doin' stuff they shouldn't, y'know?" He gives a little pointed Nod.

"Or they be worse," Right mutters. Middle nods a little worriedly, before looking around quickly.

Guy grins, "Oh I can understand completely. I'm not a cop though.. If I were, I'd be holed up in some desk job, or somethin'. Like I said, I'm helpin' out a friend. Well two friends really. You probably know one of 'em... Mr. Grant?"

The two of them look at eachother as if to find the answer. "No, don't know a Grant, man," Middle comments.

Guy hmms, "Ya sure?" He pulls a hand from his pocket, unfolding a fifty, "Well, this is what he looks like..."

Mr Grant gets a paticular eyeballing. "I'll tell you anythi-" Right is thusly poked in the side. Middle looks squarely at Guy. "There's a guy in the buildin' who's usually at the playground. I bet he was there that night." He holds out his hand, "I know his room number." Hand drawing back, "Now, what you going to ask him about? He got children in there."

Guy nods, "I'd imagine he does." He takes a while to ponder the drawn back hand. _Well, if nothing else, the fact that children are around should keep shots from being fired. Unless of course he has a silencer. Please don't have a silencer._ "I'm just gonna ask what he knows about what happened back then. If he knew who was involved, what happened since then y'know. See if he knew anyone who was hurt during the thing... it's not pleasant, I know, but as I've said, I've got to find out."

Middle nods his head, and takes the cash. "Room twenty fo."

Guy heads for room twenty four then, counting the number of steps it takes. It's a nervous habit, but it keeps him from glancing back suspiciously. He knocks on the door, twice, letting his knuckles announce his presence.

The building isn't in the most beautiful repair. While it isn't a run down trap, it looks like the walls havn't been painted in nearly a decade, and the light bulbs in the halls should have allready blown. The first floor has twenty rooms, and up the steps leads to the twenties. "Who is it?" Asks a feminine voice inside.

Guy calls out, "My name's Guy. I was told t'come by here by Leroy... said I might be able to get a question answered..."

"Question about what?" She asks, insistant. "Latrica!" A louder voice close to the door hisses. "What you want?"

Guy says, "Just some answers."

The door opens. Much like a cat listens. The chain on the door looks more durable then those pissy littel things that can get knocked off. The face of a young african man not past nineteen stares back at Guy from the slit. "Speak."

Guy does as he's instructed. "Alright. I hear y'know a bit about what happened a few years ago out in the playground."

"Playground?" That's certainly a surprise, and the tension that wound that boy's face like a spring eases off considerably. "Oh..." The door shuts, and a rattling of the chain, before it opens. "C'mon in."

Guy walks in, glancing around at the apartment, taking note of windows and other places that things might've been seen from. "Thanks," he says.

The apartment is... nice. While it isn't spotless, it's clean. The interior, not decorated by a professional, but the furnishings aren't that cheap. A girl of thirteen gives Guy an eye before she walks out of the room down a small hall. "Be quiet. There's a girl trying to sleep."

"So, uh, what you want?" Asks the boy. He's tall. Taller then Guy, but he's almost gangly.

Guy speaks in a quiet voice, "I'm wondering what you know about what happened then... things like what happened, or who was involved, or why? Or if there was anything kinda strange that happened back then, y'know."

"Guy got shot," He says simply, and walks over to a chair to sit down in. He doesn't immediately look at Guy. "I was hanging with the boys, you know? And 'the boys' wern't that good, you could say. Infact, now they's just..." He shakes his head. "Got into a gun fight over this motherfucker Tyear, right? Supposedly he killed one of the boys' friends, and he came around, and there was an arguement, and he got capped." He looks out the window. "Ain't no safe for kids to be on that playground, y'know? Fuckers like dat be all around here." He thumbs towards the hall, "But she won't listen, ya know?"

Guy nods, "Yeah? Ahhh. Hangin' with the boys. I know what you mean. So... they got into a fight over this Tyear? Anyone else get capped then? I read a little blurb about it in the headlines..." He shakes his head, "Kinda sad when somethin' like this is left to just a few lines in an old paper ya know..." He looks back towards the hall, "Well, hopefully nothin' like that'll happen anytime soon."

"Yeah, hopin'." He looks back, "Yeah. One of the boys, named Shay. Ended up not walking after that. Caught a shot from Tyear's buddy, who got his ass blown away too." He gets up, "Hey man, you want something to drink?"

Guy shakes his head, "Nah, I'm fine. Feel free to get yourself a drink if ya'd like." He watches the fellow get up. "Shay? Huh. Anyone else badly hurt? just curious y'know. And what did Tyear's crew call themselves?"

"Didn't have any real 'name' to 'em. They wern't from here, y'know. Wanted to start something, and didn't get it." He doesn't sound like he really likes talking like the whole episode. But he is keeping his eye on Guy, rather critically. "So, what's your name?"

Guy nods, "Ah, no name yet? Well I suppose that's good then. Stuff like that... well." He stands up a bit, "Name's Guy. And yours?"

He walks over, and offers his hand. "Shawntae." Guy notices, as Shawntae moves closer, something along the base of the wall by the chair. A phone jack, but not for a phone. A DSL line.

Guy shakes the hand. "Good ta meetcha. And thanks for takin' the time to talk to me about this. Is there anythin' else you can think of that might be related to this? Anyone tried startin' something there since then?"

Guy is eyed firmly by the kid. He knows those eyes, those held by someone who knows something. And suspects something. "Who sent you." He says, coldly.

Guy shrugs, "A friend of mine. Nina Anderson. Why d'ya ask?"

"I don't know no Anderson," He says, stepping up to Guy, "Now, you come askin' about the playground shit. What're you hunting?" While not neccessarily looking dangerous, Shawntae's drawn himself to his full hight over guy, glaring down at him. The detective can see the fear in that face, but it's a fear that's not the kind to cause a run.

Guy looks up to Shawntae. Then again, he looks up to alot of people. "Hunting? Just tryin' to find out what happened then. Sort out some confusion for my friend. She knew someone involved in that y'know. I dunno who though, she wouldn't say... you've nothin' to worry 'bout. I'm no cop, nor am I gonna run to anyone and go blabbin' stuff that shouldn't be blabbed."

He relaxes just a little bit. "You want to know what's going on?" He says a little more calmly. "You do me a favor. You find out about that crisp, nice looking thug that's circulating the playground. You want answers? Watch out for him, man. He's a threat."

Guy nods, "Yeah, I'll find out about him. Tell ya what. You tell me what it is you're not sayin', and I'll find out for you everything I can about this crisp lookin' thug of yours. We'll consider it a trade."

"I allready know about him, man," Shawntae says, and walks towards the kitchen. "It's what I ain't saying that's keeping me here, you got it?"

Guy nods, "Yeah... I got it" _I feel sorry for this guy if any of the others decide to come and talk to him..._ "Well, I'd say you could tell me what yer not sayin' but then that'd probably not work. Thanks for your time."

"When you find out, man, let's hope you can make that playground safe to be on," Shawntae says. "See you, man. Thanks for no trouble."

Guy nods, "I wasn't here t'cause trouble man." He asks, "I'll do my best to see about makin' that playground safe for the kids... if ya can think of anything else, well..."

"Well, I'll think of it." He says, leaning against the wall. The tone in his voice was one that is given at the end of a conversation. He nods towards the door.

Guy heads outside, keeping his eyes out for anything else of note. _I wonder what it was he isn't saying? Something's just not quite right..._ He then proceeds to exit the apartment building, keeping an eye out for a manager's office or something, as well as any DSL looking lines.

No lines from what he can tell. The night is dark, and the trio of men have split. From here, Guy can make out the playground, the large, metal climbing tool seen in the picture of the dashes almost stands out among the darkness. It's only there, though.
