Morning follows night; the undead vigilante's borrowed phone is busy. Calls to Vanessa for a status report, followed by calls to his two remaining teammates. **Meet at Detroit scene of investigation, 11 a.m., action to be taken,** the synthetic, sepulchral voice intones, whether to voicemail box or listening ear, terminated by a click. And off goes Tom, deep in thought.

As Tom devulges himself into contemplation, something slips into his conciousness. A voice alongside his own. _Tom._ It's quite familiar, infact downright fatherly.

Thomas sighs, hanging his head and drooping his shoulders. Speaking, looking around, or anything else will be useless. So will speaking. _What is it?_ he thinks into the black space beyond his mind. _I'm busy._

The tone doesn't give anything away. _Have you had the chance to read the paper, lately?_

_No, not yet, but I'll read it over like I usually do._ He doesn't bother to ask why - such a question would have already been answered. Whatever needs to be read will be waiting for him to do so. Instead of wasting time, he continues. _I'll have read it within 30 minutes. I'll be able to discuss whatever it is at that time._ Logic and straightforward honesty are his only weapons, when his mentor/nemesis commands the entrances to his very mind.

_Very well. I wouldn't want to interrupt your games. I'll get back to you around four o'clock._ Tom can feel the presence leave his mind, like the relief from a numbed headcold.

Thomas sighs, shaking his head. Insular, meddling old man... The youth continues, preparing himself for the meeting to come, and the plan beyond that.

Departing his apartment, Tom picks up the thick Sunday edition of the Millenium City Chronicle. It would appear he's made the paper today. Taking a moment to brood over the article, he simply moves on, intent on reaching the North Detroit meeting place.

Vanessa waits, veiled from view just within the alleyway two streets down from the playground itself. She paces quietly, waiting for the others.

Guy makes his way down the alleyways, chucklling wryly to himself. _Here I am, back in the ol' alleys. You'd think these guys'd have some kind of secret headquarters._ The detective steps into the alley, giving Vanessa a nod in greetings, "'Lo there. At least I'm not the only one here today." He takes a place against the wall, reclining rather lazily.

GK arrives soon after, emerging from the street itself. The white teeth are formed into a disturbing grin, as though he were the lean gray tomcat who's just managed to net itself a canary. **We await only DarkGlow,** he observes.

A few blocks from the meeting, DarkGlow steps into a darkened alley and vanishes. Donning his cloak, he then hops from alley to alley towards the meeting place. Popping in behind Vanessa, he avoids the temptation to cover her eyes and whisper "Guess who?" as sinisterly as he can. Instead, he ventures in a normal speaking voice, "Am I late?"

Van had dispelled the invisibility bubble when she spotted Guy at the alley mouth. She turns as the shadowmaster appears, surprised a second, but then shakes her head. Glancing from side to side, her hands raise, a few words mentioned before the two ends of the alley distort, the air wabbling just a little. "There. No peepers."

**Thank you,** comments GK dryly. **Please repeat for them what you told me, about the correlation.**

Vanessa pulls out some papers from the folder under her arm. "There were two instances where the phoneline in the building were used hours before the resulting incidents from the NPG. One with the armored vehicle, and one with the erasing of some criminal records. Most often the transmisions have been from a Saturday or Sunday morning, a few times on a weekday around five, but those were brief."

DarkGlow says, "'Hours before'? Not during?"

"I've got to say, I've found something. Something worth investigating," informs the sleuth. "If I may interrupt, for a minute or two."

"Right," Van assures. "The armored car incident was merely a rerouting of directions, and the directions were changed a few hours before the car was sent out. And the files wern't noticed to have been missing for a little while after the incident... There wasn't any indication that this connection was used with the CAT though."

Van looks over at Guy, then nods and quiets.

DarkGlow looks expectantly at Guy--as expectantly as an enshadowed face can, at any rate.

Guy looks as though he's going over information a moment. "It seems as though this, MavrickX character's got a bit of a rep. He's a hacker, of the highest calibur, they say. There was a Hacking Duel between Mav and this guy called Bison-coincidentally enough-and it turns out that Mav not only hacked RINGS around the his target, Bison's target, and finished his target before the 24 hours they alloted themselves were up... he did it on a 56k modem. At least that's what he claimed, and sent evidence of."

**It would be useful to see if that event, too, correlates to the use of this line. Most likely it does, but it's an additional data point,** observes the Ghost thoughtfully. **At this point, are we agreed that we have our quarry?**

Guy nods. "Yeah, we ought to. We should be careful too. One of the things I kept hearing was that he was too uh... leet?"

Vanessa purses her lips. "Well, so far, everything seems circumstancial. I'd like to get some hard evidence this guy is the hacker, and this hacker is our man."

DarkGlow shrugs. "Sure, why not? If we're wrong, we can always just go after another target. Oh, and apologize to the first guy, I guess." _Since we'll probably leave 'em alive, unless I miss my guess._ He suppresses a sigh.

Guy smirks. "Hard evidence? Nah. This is a good old fashioned hunch. And hunches are worth checking out more often than not. 'Specially if they lead to hard evidence."

**To get that evidence,** observes GK, after moments of thought, **we must incite action on the part of the hacker. Some personal connection to Yamaguchi is indicated - 'apprehend without damage' was the command to the CAT. We need to lay bait.**

"What kinda bait?" Asks Guy. _Ten to one it's the guy. Or me. It had better not be me. How much you wanna bet it's me?_

Vanessa turns back to Ghost Knight. "What've you got in mind?"

Answering with action, the Ghost pops his phone out and dials Lydon's number.

DarkGlow offers, "Recreate the circumstances of the CAT attack. Whatever he was trying it probably didn't work all that well there, and so giving him another shot seems a plausible way of luring him into acting."

A few rings. A few more. Pickup. "Yes?" It sounds like a prim British voice.

**Lydon Yamaguchi. Put him on.**

"Excu..." There's a brief pause. "He is currently in the shower. I will tell him. Give him five minutes, sir."

There are no eyes to roll; the Ghost's face remains calm and impassive. Nevertheless, he retains a hold of the phone while he fills in the intervening time by explaining what he has in mind. **Lydon will announce a small, private demonstration of neural-interface technology. He himself will be the test subject for this technology, and it will be conducted at his home with a small audience of scientists. That the test is bogus is immaterial; that fact can only be established once the hacker makes a connection, by which time it will be too late. Examine this proposal for flaws, please.**

DarkGlow says, "I assume the hacker has been in the company database before, and probably quite deeply if he's as... 'leet' as is claimed. You'd think he'd already know about any tech the company is working on and, therefore, be suspicious about this test."

**Tengu, Lydon's bodyguard and employee, still operates unimpeded, with a suit of technological armor. His continued efficiency demonstrates that at least some of Lydon's projects can escape influence.**

Vanessa glancse back and forth. "Not unless this was a joint project with another company. He pierced into Fox Mecha, not Yamaguchi - but there's no telling if he hasn't. Still," She considers, "How will we catch him? Be waiting outside the building down there, or check the connection tap, and then swoop in, powers blazing or something?"

"Not only that, you would imagine that he would know just about every project that is going on with regards to that sort of technology then." He onders, "Then again. Some of it may well be that he's ignorant of it. Or that he couldn't comprehend it. Ask if they can add some phony technical specs to the database and make it look as though they've been there?"

...says Guy.

DarkGlow says, "Perhaps the project uses a private LAN with no physical connection to the 'net?"

**The addition of specifications may be a dangerous move; the more secrets that surround the project, the greater its appeal to a curious investigator. However, I will leave that matter in Lydon's hands,** replies GK. **Whatever particulars he chooses to establish are in his hands. Our role, Vanessa, is as you say - monitor the traps we've set, and move swiftly to grab whoever springs them.**

"And hope no giant mechs crash the party," DarkGlow mutters.

Vanessa nods. "Right, I think that we should-" "Hello?" Lydon's voice sounds into the phone as Vanessa continues, "Probably also check into our suspect. I mean, he has family, right? Or friends? If he's got some powers, or some dark deals, maybe they've noticed something if they're living with him or are around him enough."

GK repeats the plan nearly verbatim into the handset, waiting for a verdict.

"If he has family. Or friends. Hackers can be a lonely bunch, from what I understand. Then again, so can just about anyone." Informs Guy. "Well then, I'll see if I can put a name to MavrickX... but uh, that might take a while."

Lydon hmms. "It sounds risky, and the press, collegues, even members of my own staff would be curious as to this new 'development' that hasn't even been developed. On the other hand, I **am** a scientist too... It sounds reasonable."

**That angle has been accounted for,** replies the Ghost curtly. **If you are willing to commit to this plan, please put your end of it in motion. We will do the rest.**

"Very well. I can't seem to have to have my own private superhero team without having to put a little work on my side. Or getting some bad press for that matter..."

Guy heads off, back towards his office, intending to contact his contacts, as it were. The first stop is the bartender whom he rents his office from. _Not a likely source for hacker information, but still... it's worth a shot._ "Hey. Gimme the usual, if you will. And uh, keep the change." He slides payment across the bartop, along with a note, asking if he knows anything about someone named MavrickX. Or has heard that name before.

The group breaks. Vanessa heads towards Lydon's own abode, to assist in monitoring and fortification for a would-be assualt for Monday evening. Darkglow and Ghost Knight head from the alley towards the first phone tap, to check. As they approach the building - through their various hidden means - they can spy two black kids playing on the playground, while a girl in her young teens sits by, with some books nearby, looking up from them to the kids variously.

Note taken, the bartender, Sam, scratches the back of his head a second. He smirks at Guy, and walks back to the kitchen, before returning with a glass of milk he sets down infront of Guy. "Nope. Only thing I know that sounds like that's Malcom X. Doubt that's what's you're looking for." After a pause. "Y'know, I think I saw that name." Voice going low, "Looking up porn a few months ago, on the computer y'know? And that name scrolled across one of the popups. Really odd; some Sesame Street porn or something slapped onto one of those good quality sites? Made me laugh my ass off."

Guy suppresses the look he's about to give the bartender. He does his best. Nary a twitch of the eyebrow. "Realy? Huh. Sounds like it might be it. He had a hacker duel with this guy who goes by the handle of Bison. I don't suppose you've seen any reference to that name around?"

Sam shakes his head. "Nah. Knew a guy back in highschool named Bison; good linebacker. But he didn't strike me like no good computer guy, to be honest." A shake of his head, while Sam wipes down a glass. "So, how's the business going, anyways, Guy?"

"Ah. Poorly, as of late. Though I did get a case recently. Working with a bunch of costumers y'know. So, hopefully I should be able to make rent this month. And last month."

Says Guy, while slumping against the bar, and taking a sip of his usual.

Sam grins a little bit. "Well, you keep workin'. Every time I hear a guy suspecting his wife of cheating or his kid doing something wrong, I always point to the stairway and say you're open for business. Who knows, may luck out, right?" After a second, "Oh, say, wanna see my new pot?"

"Yeah. Well thanks, glad to hear you're keeping me in mind." He grins. "Sure, I suppose it's worth a look. If it's new, I mean." Says Guy, looking amused, by now.

Nodding, Sam bends down behind the bar. "Just finished it yesterday!" He proclaims, and lifts a small ceramic jar onto the bartop, filled with beer nuts, pretzels, and the like. It's tan, with various little painted symbols and the like, of different languages and characters. He turns it around to show off a little paragraph on the front. "See this? It's Latin. Says 'If you can read this, Drink More.'"

"Heh. Si hoc legere scis, ebibo plusculus." He reads, before heading back to his office. "Thanks Sam." He then reclines in his chair, putting his feet up on his desk. This seems to be one of the primary reasons for this desk, given the heelmarks on it. He dials the phone, trying to get ahold of his next contact. A guy who specializes in knowing information. Trivia, some may say, secrets, to others.

Guy knows the right way to call. He lets the phone ring three times, then hangs up, and calls once more. On the second ring, "Hello." Monotone, experimental, giving nothing away.

"Hello. Guy here. Are you available for a chat? I know you don't like things over the phone, but this IS the best way for me to get ahold of you..."

"Oh. Oh, Guy. Right. Yeah." He pauses. "Yeah. Phone works, good. What do you want to know, Guy?"

"I'd like to know a how I can find out the name of a Hacker. Or at least who can put me in touch with someone that would know this. I'm stuck, so I turned to you. Of course, I know, nothing's free..."

"Hmmm. A hacker? A hacker. I don't know off hand... Oh. Oh, green will jog my memory probably, but yeah. Let me think." The sound of a chair squeaking. "Hm. I may know of somebody, sure. If there's a criminal record of this guy, I can get it. Or I can start poking people who I know. So yeah."

"Alright. Well let me know what you find out." He adds, "If it helps, the name's MavrickX. He had a duel with another hacker who goes by the handle of Bison, though I'm sure you know this already."

"Right, right. I'll get back to you, Guy. You'll know, and then I'll have what I need, and everything will be well."

"You never fail to creep me out, y'know that right? Thanks. Let me know what you can find out. I'll see what I can dig up on your behalf though. And the green, of course." Guy then hangs up, and gets out of his chair. He stretches, once, twice, and stares at the phone. _I give the Prof. 'til the count of ten to call... then I'm out of here._ He chuckles ruefully.

Meanwhile, the Ghost Knight stays busy. He checks and re-checks the taps; checks that their data is being spooled properly into the recording mechanisms; checks that, at the moment of Lydon's pronouncement the following day, he personally will receive a transmission of whatever Shawntae's telephone receives or sends. Every component of the trap is examined to its fullest; his moral certainty that the team's quarry is THE hacker drives him on.

_So a hero is silent, grim and meticulous. Right. Wonder if I should write this stuff down..._ DarkGlow thinks. "If you yank out that wire again, I think you'll completely destroy the contact," he offers.

**Nothing so crude is needed,** replies GK grimly, focusing his will. The scattered components of his connection knit themselves together, seemingly motivated to do so only by his baleful glare. **We're done here. Have you chosen a stake-out position?**

DarkGlow shrugs. "I was thinking his closet, or somesuch."

**As you wish. We have some time, and I've memorized the sewer routes between Yamguchi's home, here, and Shawntae's. I suggest we check in with Guy, and separate for the evening.**

_Details of the intervening time can be learned in the [next issue](memesis.php?id=449)._

---

Lydon placed a small announcement that Yamaguchi Corp will be testing a nueural-interface technology, directed at high-speed computer use, training with advanced computers to new individuals for high placed systems jobs, and to assist in those who are unable to use keyboards due to handicaps. He made a slight comment this might have pushed some of his competitors to grow a little aggressive, but doesn't name names or incidents - since the police report said accidental, and no reason to speculate otherwise.

Also in the news, caught just after Lydon's little anouncement, is the death of someone hit early that morning by the Monorail. No name has been announced just yet.

The announcement was made public around two in the afternoon. At three thirty, GK recieves an alert of a phone call from Shawntae's apartment.

Darkglow arrives in a dark corner in Shawntae's apartment around three o'clock. Just in time to see the young african teen push through the door of Shawntae's apartment, a six year old girl - who was on the playground the day before - in tow. "Shut up, Keisha," She saysh almost immediately. "Do you Liiiiike him?" "Shut Up, Keisha." "You like him! Na-" "If you don't shut up, I'll not watch you at the playground." "Nooo!" The bickering goes back and forth for a good few minutes, before Keisha bouncse off into her room, the teen dumps her things into her own. At three thirty, she calls someone named Ayisha, and the two seem to go on and on about the school day, and a boy or two. Tom recieves Ayisha's side of the conversation.

Both Ghost Knight and Darkglow sit. Around five fifteen, Shawntae comes in, a bag from McDonalds under his arm, and a paper bag. "Keisha!" The girl comes tearing out of her room. Shawntae takes out a box of nuggets, and a small fry. "Here, brought you your favorite." "Honey mustard?" "Yep." "Yay!" "And a coloring book." "Yes!" He extracts it from the paper bag. The teen has propped herself against the doorframe into the hall, watching. "I'm going to go look at it!" "Do that for a while, Keish? I'm gunna clean, can't have you getting on the carpet and all." "Okay." She wanders off into her room, things in tow.

"You want me to go to my room?" "Yes, Latrice. Not like you come out've there for hours anyways." She rolls her eyes, and walks towards him. He takes out a wrapped sandwich and fries. She crosses to get her something to drink from the kitchen. "I don't like you doin' this. That guy came by yesterday." "Did he do anything?" "No. Just saw him." Shawntae swears. "Well, I'm hoping I only have to deal with them one more time, and then we can move the fuck out of here, and I'll erase any trace of us buying a different apartment. And maybe they can't find us then."

Latrice sighs, crossing towards her room. "Keisha's gunna hate leaving here." "I'll make sure there's a place to play." Latrice just Looks back at him the way an annoyed teenager can, before moving into her room. With a more resigned sigh, the lanky man gets himself something to drink, and brings the fast food bag over to the couch. He unzips his lap top from his bag, and deposits it carefully onto the coffee table, before hooking the DSL line to it.

Silent as a shadow, DarkGlow slips into a better position to watch what happens on the notebook's screen.

Shawntae looks at his watch. "Okay. I got... thirty minutes, before this shit's supposed to go online." He calls up something on his computer, then clucks his tongue. "Better get started on the other stuff." Hands clap onto his knees, as he stares at the computer screen. As DG moves into place, he can see various programming scripts running, things coming across the screen, but the youth isn't even handling the keyboard. The window flicks almost immediately as something starts processing, to another window. He takes a mouthfull of fries.

_Well, isn't that just **special**,_ DarkGlow thinks. _Hope I didn't miss any 'bots in hidden under the bed..._The last thought is only mildly sarcastic.

The window is flicked back to the first, which has completed it's running. The process continues, the Mac computer running Linux, for the moment. He continues to eat casually. A check of his watch.

_Step forward and just slice him, before he knows what's happening, I think. And then wrap him up, if he dodges at all. 'Course if he doesn't dodge, then guess the wrap will be a bit redundant..._ DarkGlow plans. _Err... if he tries anything, I guess. Probably be a bad idea if he didn't. But I can **plan** for it, can't I? Yes, indeed. Can still do that, anyway..._

Blinking at the rapidly shifting screens, DarkGlow decides that peering over the guy's shoulder is rather useless. Concentrating for a second, he pops out of the apartment, and into a shadow situated in the building's laundry room. He dials a number. "Hey, old skull. It's me."

GK is brought up to date briefly, the hushed tones of his teammate music to his hears. **I am on my way,** he says briefly into the phone. **Please call Guy and Vanessa - and find a point of observation outside the apartment. Expect trouble.** With that, he moves out as quickly as his potent abilities permit.

As DG finishes, an african american woman walks in, a basket of dirty clothes under her arm. Simply by the Look on her face, Darkglow would think twice about doing anything offensive. Despite his invisibility, speed, teleportation, and thus... she looks very ticked off. "Damn kids and they damn kool-aid. Pour that kool-aid on that nintendo, 's what I'll do," She hisses into the washing machine.

DarkGlow takes a position outside the apartment building, in the shelter of a recessed doorway. He knows which window is their quarry's, and can keep an eye on the street and front door, just in case someone unexepcted--or expected, really--arrives.

Arriving underground, the vigilante's sense of perception freely roams up through the intervening layers of physical matter - no more of an obstruction than a silken spiderweb to his uncanny awareness - and slowly, methodically, he plots his best approach. He'll practically be swimming through walls and ceilings, through the ductwork between floors, but it's short enough that he can hold his breath. His route thus memorized, and with confidence that DarkGlow has made contact and is standing by, he begins moving...

Eyes watchfully on the street, DarkGlow lets both Guy and Vanessa in on what's happening.

Guy, after being informed of what's to be going down says, "Alright. Just clue me in when you need some me around. I can show up anytime. I've got the name of the guy killed earlier today. Lucius Alexander of the Dew Chemical Company's board of directors. Death by monorail."
