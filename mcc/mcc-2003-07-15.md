DarkGlow nods. "That's right. Give it to me straight." He nods again. "No, I'm not Chinese..." He scowls impatiently. "No, I won't sue! Damn it, just cook it like you do for Chinese customers, get it? Don't hold back the hot stuff--if I'm not sweating by the second bite, I'll never order from you again." He rolls his eyes and reaches for his wallet with his free hand. "Here's my card number--put a ten buck tip on for the driver and tell him to just leave the food by the door, all right?" He gives his card number, nods again, then rattles off an address. "Right. Thanks--and hot, y'hear? Right, bye." He disconnects the phone call. _Sue him if I burn my tongue... sheesh! Anyway, I hope he at least hurries..._

The food arrives in around twenty five minutes. Darkglow collects his food. And, indeed, the first bite is subtle. A swallow. Nothing. Nothing. Damnit, they ripped hi- then the burning starts. And his phone rings.

Sucking frantic, cooling breathe into his suddenly tortured mouth--_Oooh, nice!_\--he fumbles his cell from a pocket. _Great timing, skullface. You can pretend not to eat, but I'm not saving the city on an empty stomach!_ His thumb punches the right button, and a slightly hoarce "Hullo?" issues from between painful lips.

The voice filtering into the earpiece sounds concerned from that one word. "Darkglow?" Lydon questions from inside. "You all right?"

DarkGlow coughs in surprise. "Uh... yeah, fine. Just having some apparently decent Chinese takeout. If I have to abandon it, I swear I'm gonna expense it on the company account."

He laughs. "No, no, nothing that harsh. I just had a question for you."

DarkGlow blinks. _Uh... okay... Now what would I have done to draw the boss' wrath?_ He winces as a couple examples come to mind. _Um..._ "Grey," he offers. "I should think it would be obvious."

"I thought the answer to that question was 42. Say, DarkGlow, would you know anything about the labs at the Yamaguchi testing facility?"

DarkGlow shrugs. "Nice place. Shiny buttons, and blinking lights. Lots of fans, too." _And now for the herring..._ "No Tia, though."

Lydon hms. "No Tia? She was in the one in the basement... Did you happen to find the Tengu suit while you were looking for her?"

_Okay, **that** was a little too close to the mark. Time to 'fess up, buddy boy..._ DarkGlow clears his throat. "Basement? No, I didn't get down that far. Actually, I found Tengu and decided that caution was the better part of valour or something. Didn't realize anything in there was super-secret. Kind of a mess, isn't he? Didn't see any blood, though, so I guess the pilot's all right. With all that high-tech stuff he's built out of, it's kinda disappointing that he still needs a warm body inside, eh? Tia, now--she's the real thing, metal through and through. Bet Tengu's pilot's jealous..."

"Well, I wouldn't say that. I did build it, but I don't have that much knowledge of robotics to make it something like Tia. It's all the same. And it's a good thing the pilot is all right. If he had taken any more hits, there would have been blood, that's for sure."

"You built it?" DarkGlow queries. "Hmm, I was going to poke at it, but I figured there wouldn't be much point, other than your typical guy it's-shiny-and-goes-fast-and-right-it-also-flies-and-beats-things-up oogling thing. Guess you're not just a corporate suit, huh?"

"You wouldn't have been shot for poking it, but be careful." Lydon sounds hesitant at that statement. "Oh, yes, I'm not. I couldn't inherit the company until I made a firm contribution to it, so I studied gravital physics and electronics, and helped build some breakthrough technology."

DarkGlow laughs. It's almost not forced. "'Gravital physics'? Never found a home study kit for that, I'm afraid." His tone shifts a bit. "Is it hard to fly? I mean, it's every kid's dream right, to sprout wings--or powered armour, in this case--and just fly up into the sky? See how close you can get to the moon, in the darkness of the night, before--" He breaks off. "Sorry, guess you can never be satisfied with what you've got, huh?"

"That seems to be pretty much the truth," Lydon agrees, sounding relaxed, thoughtful. "It's difficult to fly because it takes training to get used to the controls. It's hell trying to get used to it. But I guess teleporting through shadows can be disorienting at first, too."

DarkGlow sifts that for data. "Eh, I had help--" He breaks off again. _Less analysis, more attention, dammit!_ He continues, swallowing audibly. "Sorry, hungry. Actually, once you can feel the shadows in your head, it's not hard to just step from one to another. The Z-axis was tricky, though--first time, I stepped out a metre off the ground. Almost twisted my ankle landing." He laughs again. "I needed to work on feeling the edges, more."

"Ouch," Lydon replies with a chuckle. "The first time I tested the Gravital thrust system, I broke a table by pushing down on a can of coke." A pause. "I merely wanted to know if you were the one that the security camera spotted."

DarkGlow mentally sighs in relief. _Either he didn't notice, or he's not pursuing. Good, either way._ "Cameras? Feh, what's the point of sneaking around invisibly when cameras and robots and battle suits spot you anyway? It's just not fair. Was it infra-red or ulta-violet? Or some sort of radar? I swear I'm gonna have to get some IR gear or whatever and practice hiding from it..."

"IR. Hey, look on the bright side. If no one uses any technology on their side, you're fine. Or you should go after them all that much harder."

DarkGlow sighs. "Except everything we've gone after, from CAT to the hacker to the joker after Tia is firmly wrapped in high-tech wizardry. Don't suppose you could lend me an IR camera for a while?"

"True..." Lydon hms. "Sure. That can be arranged. But I'll let you go back to your dinner. It may be spicy, but I don't want it to get cold."

DarkGlow says, "Yeah, that's right. Anyway, please make certain Tia's all right, would you? It's hard enough being an orphan without--" _Geh, stop talking already!_ He concludes hastily. "Uh, I mean it must be hard being an orphan. 'Later..." He hangs up. _Orphan? Where did that come from? Who cares if she's an orphan? Besides, she's a robot, anyway. Mental note: letting your blood sugar fall to critical levels turns you into an idiot. Don't let it happen again._ With a scowl, he retrieves his chopsticks and starts again into his meal, taking small, quick bites. His mind, however, goes over the conversation with Lydon whole, slowly and carefully.

Tia's eyes open, and she looks around the room. A mind this fast can think of so many things at once.... What's first? Lacking the usual 'Where am I' that accompanies conciousness. She wonders simply... 'What today'... Is she truly safe here. Atleast she seems in tact.

The black-clad, dead-headed fighter is there, watching carefully. **You are in one of Mr. Yamaguchi's out of the way storage buildings,** it announces in that low, dead voice. **I am here to examine you.**

Tia stands up for a second, "There is no need. I am fine." She looks straight at the figure.

That leering white skull, so seemingly human and yet so oddly not, tilts to the side in apparent consideration. **So you say,** reports the Ghost after a moment. **Please hold still.** A wheeled drafting table, prepared with paper and pens for apparently this purpose, was sitting in the corner, unused and unminded; it rolls seemingly on its own power toward the vigilante. His hand stretches out toward it, and the pens come seemingly to life, beginning to draw of their own accord the schematics that he can 'see' within Tia. **I will assist in any repairs you need, now or later. Fortunately, you have no living aura to impede me, and I can work faster than Lydon or his whole industrial capability..**

Tia looks at you, then over at the drafting table, and the pens... she looks down at herself. An aprehensive look draws across her face, but she seems powerless to stop this anyway. She shivers, involentarily, and her voice changes to a lower Timbre, having a bit more of what one might call natural rythm to it. "Isn't think kinda forward for a first date?" Then she blinks, and returns to her carefully metered- monotonous voice, "That was Steve."

**Indeed,** responds the Ghost, absorbed in his work. **This serves a larger purpose beyond repairs,** he adds, for the moment drawing back from conversation, it seems, to focus on the schematic. **Tell me about Steve?** follows after long moments, a more polite and subtly sociable request.

Tia's eyes stare intently at the drawing. She must have heard your request, but, she doesn't respond, watching as the pends draw her on the drafting table...

After a moment, GK becomes conscious of the silence. **This is my power,** he explains, slowly. **I am master of the physical, but.. I can only touch what life has departed from, or that which was never alive. It is this same power that permits me to peer into your inner mechanisms.**

Tia nods, "I ... see." She looks back at GK, "Steve... Built me. I don't know what else to say. I moslty know him though his interjections, and his dead body as I woke up."

Nodding, Thomas devotes some part of his mind to the conversation, while the main bulk of his attention remains fixed on the inner mechanisms, and on guiding the pen with inhuman speed and accuracy over its page. With one section completed, the page flips off the board as though caught by some wind, and a new one is begun. **And if he was dead, and is now within you, then..? Or perhaps, it is only his memories? Or a recorded message, meant for you. Do you have any ideas what the nature of his possession could be?**

Tia says, "He... Lives in part of me. Atleast, that's what he says. I hear his voice periodically. He seems able to interpret my inputs, so what he says seems to hold true."

Thomas nods slowly, as his animated pen continues its work. **We will learn what we can about this man, if you wish. There are important questions unanswered about you, and those who pursued you.**

Tia nods. However, she seems to have motionlessness down to a science. Peopel sway.. they breathe.. the live.. She... is... Much like a pilar. "I only hope to help."

**You can help immensely, depending.** The skull actually forms itself into a wide, and unnerving, smile at this. The pen drops to the table, and Tom's gloved hand stretches forward. His mechanical subject lifts a foot off the ground in effortless levitation. **With my aid, you can fly, or be defended from attack.. And with your aid, I may not need to worry about more like him who wore the battlesuit during our attack. This investigation will prove dangerous, of course.**

Lydon had returned for an IR camera, calling DarkGlow thirty or so minutes later for him to make the pickup. Absently, Lydon mentions where Tia is. "Could you inform her that I've found a more stable, comfortable place for her? I'm not ready to send her that way - I have a few things to iron out. But I have no idea what to... put in there, for her. What she needs. But, your camera." He hands the object to DG, then departs. With a shrug, a smart comment to the wind, DarkGlow searches out the shadows, and finds himself in the storeroom.

GK is already present. He has before him several annotated schematics, which after a moment's inspection prove to be those of an android or robot of some kind - one guess as to who. He's apparently pencilled in several notes here and there. He becomes aware of DG's presence after a moment. **I wish to learn more about Tia, and those who attacked her. The place to start is with the manufacturers of her components. She could not be hand-made to the very nuts and bolts; we may learn something by following this trail.** The skull actually smiles. **I wish your help.**

DarkGlow shrugs. "If there's anything hidden in the shadows, I'll find it," he promises. "I'll start in that corner, then, shall I?" He indicates the far side of the room with an ironic gesture.

**Your skill at sarcasm is not what is required,** replies the Ghost, with some of his own. **If that is your only talent, then I withdraw the offer. However, if you are actually interested...**

Tia is standing there as well.. She looks over at DG, but says nothing. She is looking over GK's shoulder as he notes.

DarkGlow grins, a flash of bright teeth showing from beneath the darness of his hood. "I find myself with a full belly and time stretching out before me. It's either help you or try hiding from this infernal camera--and I think I'd have more success helping you. For now, anyway."

**Good enough.** The plotting paper is swivelled sideways for the other's inspection, as Tom leans back a little. **Some components I can identify, some... I cannot. We must either trace legitimate sales, or see if we can identify a sort of \`black market' for parts. Tia's maker was most likely murdered, so I consider the latter a possibility.**

DarkGlow glances at the drawing, then at Tia. "Kinda like having an X-Ray, I guess," he notes in an aside to her. To GhostKnight he replies, "Don't suppose you can see any serial numbers on the components...?"

The parts seem to have been purchased, all except one marked as stolen. They have been bought via the internet, and shipped throughout the country, but atleast a third to Millenium City, and a few of those to a spesific address. The purchasing methods were via credit cards, but most of those have lead to deceased individuals, or discontinued cards, except for one or two, that point back to the same address in Millenium city.

Checking past logs and billing information, other parts were mailed to those same places around the US, but more to the MC address then the others. Not enough was purchased purely from these companies to build Tia alone, though.
