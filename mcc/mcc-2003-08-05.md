Tia is taken aback by the mist figure rising before her... She stares passively at it... "What to do.." She wonders.

Guy blinks, a few times. "WHat in the... hey... who, what are you?" Guy makes his way towards th door, moving somewhat swiftly as he tries to get through the mist that seems to be blocking the door. "Ack."

Thomas is upstairs, darting at full speed to "head off" the misty monster, if indeed it can be stopped by material barriers. It can, he reasons, based on its ability to affect the mobster it has a hold of.

The mist is cold. Thick, like gripping, unyielding frozen air. Jimmy screams.

DarkGlow's shadowstuff coils like a snake, then springs forward in a whiplash tendril. It strikes the mist near the door, and it parts like a torn curtain, exposing it to Tia and Guy, and the shadow skulker. Jimmy is wrapped in tendrils of the cool fog, the strain in his shoulders, the rabid kicking showing how much it hurts. The shotgun hovers next to him, beginning to strike him like an invisible batter. Beyond this, though, the 'creature' is seen. It is not made up of mist, but the best word to fit would be ghost. A torso of translucence floats just beside the thug. The limbs are a blurry haze, like some wave of undulating heat. It's head is merely a sillouette, but eyes, like two motes of darkness pure, flare in the air.

There's a sharp intake of breath that can be heard, just as the speedy detective steps through the door. He utters, softly, under his breath almost, "Revenant," as he turns his head towards the Ghost.

Those eyes turn on Guy. A voice detached of this world hisses everywhere and nowhere, a rasp like the wind through dead leaves. "Do not interfere." Jimmy twists in the air, looking towards Guy, his eyes wide and frantic. "Help me, man! He-" The resounding crack of the shotgun against his skull silences him, blood splattering through Revenant. Jimmy sags in the air.

Tia blinks as she watches. Sickly, the only thought that passes through her head is 'Nifty'. She poses herself ready to fight.. now that the mob guy is dead, the thing will probably try and make a run for it.

Down the stairs comes the Ghost Knight, just in time for Jimmy's demise to be witnessed. **Hold!** his own dead voice snaps, ringing through the air commandingly. **We are not your enemy, but you must explain yourself.**

Guy is unable to look at those dark eyes. _Geez... this thing creeps me out more than that three month old Tuesday Night Special I've got growing away in my fridge..._ "What... why? Why'd you kill him? Why'd you kill the others?"

Revenant turns to the hanging mobster, as blood dribbles down the back of his head. It shakes Jimmy, as if frustrated. "No," The hiss whispers across the ear. "No. Wake up. Suffffer..." Each word resonating with so much cold anger. Slowly it turns towards the Ghost Knight, while behind it the shotgun begins to twist, bend. Metal screams as it is destroyed slowly, a purposed show of strenght. "They must die. All of them." The hatred is nearly scalding.

Thomas makes no move, but stares coldly back at this cold creature. **Explain why,** his synthetic voice demands, devoid of any trace of fear or doubt. Though Thomas is certainly disturbed, the physical and metaphorical masks he wears betray none of it, and he takes comfort from his shield.

Tia has little psyche to be shattered by the ghoul's displays on anger.. She watches passivly, content to let Ghost gather information, for now...

Jimmy is dropped, the fog discarding him as though it were disgusted with holding the man. "Revenge."

Guy blinks, "Heh. It's always about revenge isn't it. Yeah... so hey, there you go. You're really very angry aren'tcha. But... who's they? Everyone?"

_Now we are getting somewhere,_ reflects Thomas for a moment, bolstered by the fact that this creature - Revenant, did he hear properly? - has not yet attacked.

The phantom turns, casting a glance down at Jimmy. The body jerks, as if kicked by a mule. "You will stop me." It is not a question. Those black holes into darkness fall onto Guy, the wrathful thing beginning to drift his way.

Guy does his best to not look into the darkness of the eyes... h's unable to avoid it though. _Well here ya go kid, starin' darkness in the face. Remember fear is the mindkiller and uh... crud..._ "I will stop you, you say? Alright. How'm I gonna do that...?"

**STOP,** commands the wrathful voice of the dead-head vigilante, as he stretches out a gloved hand. **If you wish justice, we are your allies. If not, we will indeed stop you. But choose wisely.**

"You seek justice through the court of law. Law has failed me. Death will not." With that, it turns, and begins floating away, with each foot does it grow less visible.

Guy quirks an eyebrow. "Yeah... well law might have failed you, but it doesn't give you the right to go around killing people. Justice... well justice isn't the same thing as death, Revenant."

Thomas snorts a little, behind his mask. _Think who you're talking to, bub._ But he doesn't break away. Instead, he begins snapping out instructions. **DarkGlow, please keep one of these guys on ice for me. Alive. Tia, Guy, I need you. Come.** And with that he moves swiftly and purposefully, walking in the direction he sees (or feels) the creature move.

Tia nods to Ghost, and follows the ghoul, falling in stride with GK. "What are we going to do?" She asks.

Guy follows after Thomas, looking somewhat perplexed. _So... I'm going to stop Revenant. I wonder if I should be afraid. I probably should. It's always a safe bet._ He pipes up, "Uh, where's it going?"

"Death is all I have left." The bitter sorrow is thick enough to swim in, as the wraith simply... is not there anymore. The Knight's sensitive prospects detect no more. No more tracings of ... whatever it was. Shadows across the room ripple. "We have one," Calls DarkGlow from the next room. "The others ran."

Thomas nods slowly. **Ashlen Terrace,** he repeats, aloud. **Apartment twelve. Tia, your linkup is working? We need to find that address, and get there, now.**

DarkGlow walks out of the room, and stares at Jimmy's body. After a few seconds, he kneels, putting fingers to the man's throat. "He's not dead." A smirk draws over the pale man. "Yet."

Tia looks over at GK, "Momentarily." Her eyes flash, and she calls Lydon, and converses briefly with him inside of her own head. A minute or two, and she replies, coldly, "I know the way."

A voice speaks into Tia's ear. "I'm on it." After a few seconds. "Okay, there are three apartment buildings on Ashlen Terrace."

The three apartment buildings are surveyed. From the mailboxes: William Dugan, Duncan Kade, and Kacey Watson.The first has three people inside. The second, one, the third, two.

Tia stands outside with Guy and GK.. SHe puzzles over the new dilema. "So, we sit ouside and wait for the screams of death?"

Guy ponders, "I'm not terribly certain that there will be screams of death. We just have to find the thign. It might not actually scream, you know."

Thomas comes back after a moment, having slipped into that strange trance of concentration he sometimes does. **Guy, the first apartment. Ask, be discreet. There is a child within. Tia, stand quiet watch at the second apartment. Do not disturb the occupant. I will take the third.**

Tia positions herself infront of the door to the second apartment and stares at the door. Unnervingly, she doesn't stop, or acnwoledge any passer-byers.

Guy heads up to the first apartment number 12. He looks about curiously, amd then knocks on the door, softly. It's a familiar rythm. Tap tap tap tap tap. Tap tap. _Huh. So is this the part where the door busts open and I get eaten?_

The first apartment is a fourth of a mile from the other two. Guy can return to them easily enough, however. Approaching Apartment Twelve, he gives a knock. Another. By the fourth, the door opens, a tired looking man in his thirties peers out. "Hello?"

Guy speaks up, but just a bit. He sounds, really, rather relieved. "Hello. Uhm, yeah... hi uh... how are you?"

That earns a blink. "Fine." That seems to have caught him off guard. "Willy, who is it?" He turns back. "I have no clue. Who are you? What's this about?"

Guy's mind races. _Uhhhh... quick... think of something._ "VACUUMS! Uhm, I mean, Vacuums. I'm a Vacuum cleaner salesman you know. As well as a purveyor of other fine goods, ranging from encyclopediae to stylishly fashionable bowties..."

"... Thank you, sir. But uh... we're not interested." The door closes.

Guy is never one to let a door get in his way. Or at least he wouldn't be if it hadn't already closed. _Crud. Crud crud crud crud crud crud crud._ He dials up the rest of the team, informing, "Uhm, I got kinda nervous and I do believe I just got shut out of the apartment."

Thomas's reply is icy cold. **You are responsible for their safety. Do it, however it must be done.**

Meanwhile, Ghost Knight sifts through the apartment. It would seem that the apartment is a woman's, through and through. He seems not to bare any fruit, until he sifts through the man's clothing perceptively. A pistol, a wallet containing a lot of cash. The cell phone inside of it rings like an angry cricket.

Though creeping clothing is not an ordinary sight, there is hopefully nobody around to see it. Tom huddles outside the doorway, exerting his powers and his discretion both to their fullest as he seeks to draw out a cell phone he detected. Once in his hand, he moves well away from the door before snapping it open, and listening quietly.

The voice on the other side is not familiar. "Hello? Ricky? Ricky, man, shit is bad."

"I have your man," the voice says into the phone. It's the voice Thomas heard boring into his very bones, Revenant's voice, though it's the Ghost Knight powering it. "You will be permitted to live, if you send your boss here - alone."

"Wh... who the fuck are you?"

"I am vengeance. The Family, and Dew, will all die, unless you do as I say," the hissing voice of doom answers into the phone, even as Tom considers this turn of events. Will bringing the major players together solve this faster? He hopes so.

There's a moment of silence. "I... uh... I'll call you back."

"Your boss. Or your life." And the phone snaps shut.

From inside, "Ricky, did you hear something?"

Thomas clicks off his radio, having informed his teammates to regroup at the third apartment. He turns, then kicking the door to the bedroom off its hinges in a surge of violent telekinetic strength, and into his hand the weapon springs, borne by Tom's power. **Ricky. Just the man I wanted to see,** says the Ghost, again all business.

Tia leaves her post at the second apartment, just as a little kid was gettign up the nerve to poke her in the thigh. She wanders away, and steps up to the door of the third apartment.. Staring at it, as she hears the crashes from inside.

Kacey Watson squeals and claws behind Ricky, who immediately sits up in the bed he were springloaded. "You!" He yells at the Ghost Knight accusatorial, pointing an angry finger. "Where the hell you been?"

Guy disappears from the hallway he'd been standing in front of, only to reappear in the hallway of the third building. He looks about, wondering, "Are we late, uhm..." He watches Tia... "We should probably go inside."

**Oh? Were you looking for me? Next time use e-mail,** the vigilante suggests sardonically. **Ricky. The Revenant is coming. It attacked Jimmy the Shotgun. Jimmy fingered you. Tell me why and I will spare your worthless life. Stay silent and I'll do the job myself.**

Tia shrugs at Guy, "If you insist." She waits for him to step inside, and will follow as he does so..

Guy nods, "Uhm... ladies first..."

Tia blinks, "I see no ladies here."

"Reve-what?" Ricky frowns. "Jimmy the Shotgun?" He presses the palm of his hand into his temple. "What?" He frowns. "I havn't seen him in a year and a half. Hell if I know."

Thomas shakes his head. **Dew Chemical. Ring any bells?** Casually he crumples the borrowed pistol up into a useless ball of metal and powder as he speaks. **I suggest you find a way to be useful to me.**

Guy ponders. "Oh. Well then, uhm, after you. Or I'll go then." He moves to open the door.

Ricky sits up, and frowns darkly. "Dew... Hey! Atleast give me my pants, damnit."

Tia shrugs, and moves to open the door too.. She bumps into Guy, but manages to get hte door open and step through, looking at the inside, she tries to discover where the conflict is coming from.

Guy follows after Tia. "Indeed. So uh..." he follows Tia in and looks around, ready to beat up any evil mafia goons who may be waiting in the apartment...

Thomas moves quick as lightning, with one leg darting up. His heavy booted foot slams into Ricky's collar-bone, slamming the mobster down flat on his back on the bed, and stays put, pinning the man in place and applying that subtle hint of pressure to his trachea. **Pants are not your problem right now, Ricky. Answer the question.**

Ricky winces, but it certainly isn't scaring him completely. "All right. All right. It's been a long time." Shifting under the pressure, "I've only worked for Dew three times. Twice to make some things 'disappear', once for a hit."

**Details,** demands the cold voice, as the heel digs into Ricky's solar plexus and twists a bit.

He coughs. "It's hard to talk with you doing that," He croaks. "It was a beating. Severe beating. I oversaw Jimmy, Rafael, Niech..." His brows wrinkle. "And another guy. Weasely little fuck, don't remember him. Dew wanted to shut someone up. So they had us beat the hell out of him."

**Who?** demands the Ghost, applying still more pressure.

"Stop it! You're killing him!" Kacey yells from her position trying to shrink into the wall. "Kace, shut up. I've got this," Ricky says strained. "Some foreman for Dew. Uh... Thulan... Thayland. Yeah. Bobby Thayland."

**And what happened to Bobby?** asks the Ghost, almost conversationally, keeping the pressure constant. **What did you do?**

"We busted him up good. Took his wallet, dumped him in a ditch. Made it look like a mugging. Told him we'd pop his sister if he spoke another word about Dew's lack of care with where they got rid of the chemicals they didn't want anyone to hear about."

The cellphone rings.

Thomas releases his pressure somewhat, though he keeps Ricky pinned down. The phone opens. And the Ghost waits, and listens.

"Who's you?" The voice on the other line is a little withered. And though while not friendly, the tone doesn't insult. Respectful.

Guy nods to Tia. "Indeed. Well we're on our way, I suppose. Can you get out of here on your own?" He then heads out of the apartment, deciding, "I should swing by my office... such as it is."

Tia loks around for a second, then closes her eyes, and, in her head again, calls Lydon.

"I am vengeance," repeats the Ghost, 'borrowing' Revenant's voice again. "If you are the boss, you have been told to come here alone. Come, or the lives of your precious Family are mine."

Guy says, "Unless y'know, we should stay here. Revenant might probably be coming here soon. Unless it waits for another night. Like Revenant's been doing for the last few days."

There's a hesitation. "Why do you want my Family?"

Thomas parries. "Come, and you will be told. Fail to come, and I will continue the killing."

Tia relays the information to Lydon. "I'll get it to you soon." There's some silence on the other side of the phone. "Gimmie fourty five minutes."

"It shall be so," says the Ghost in the other voice, then hangs up. He pockets the phone and eases off on Ricky, breaking out into a fleshless grin. **Stay cool, Ricky. Everybody's going to relax now, and wait.**

Thirty minutes later, Tia recieves the relay. It's Shawntae. "Okay. Bobby Thayland was a worker for Dew Chemicals two and a half years ago. He was savagely beaten. Paralyzed from the neck down, damaged voice box. He lives in Hamtamck. He lives with his sister Erin."

Tia relays the given information, word-for-word, but calls short of using Shawntae's actual voice.

The door opens. In shuffles in a man in his 80s. Wrinkles run like a waterfall across his face. He can walk without aid, but he is slow. Closing the door, he merely stands in the threshold, waiting.

Guy waits patiently until the guy who is in his 80's shows up. He blinks, several times as the wrinkled, and probably not terribly friendly fellow shows up. He murmurs, "Uhmmmm... we were expecting him... right? Or uh... are we... uhm... doin' something else?"

Tia nods to Guy, "I de believe so." She looks over at the aging man, and steps twords him. Slowly.. "You are expected." She states.

He looks at Tia with very tired, unhappy eyes. "What do you want."

Guy nods, "As long as we have the right guy. Right this way... I do believe the audience chamber, such as it is... is through the door over there."

Tia betrays no emotion, "Let's go into the bedroom." She states. "Follow me." However, she doesn't lead... She walks beside the gentleman.. But does not touch him.

Thomas turns to examine the new arrival. **You are the boss?** he asks.

Tia returns to the front room after her escort is complete.

That seems just fine with him. Kacey had gotten herself a robe, and Ricky is sipping a scotch. He takes a look at Ricky, then turns to the Ghost Knight. "I am Joseph Sorelli. I'm who you're after. Talk."

**The Revenant shook down Jimmy the Shotgun earlier tonight. Jimmy fingered Ricky here. The ghost who attacked both the Mob, and Dew Chemical, is on its way now, presumably. I want to know why,** the Ghost explains. **That you now live should be evidence that I am not the killer you sought.**

A nod. "I do not know." Sorelli draws to a loveseat in the room, settling down on it. He shakes his head. "The Chinese influence is growing by the week. Our family is weak, because the crime market here is so open. I cannot afford to lose my people to some ghost story."

**Your man Jimmy is in the hospital because of that 'ghost story',** replies GK coldly. **Among the board of directors at Dew, who has contact with you that is still alive?**

Sorelli frowns, which seems to fold the skin of his face. It looks like he frowns a lot. "Wilson Carter. But he is the only one. I havn't heard of any association with Dew in many months. I cannot think of anything this would be over, off hand. Maybe an angry enviornmentalist." This said with a bit of a sneer.

**I hope you enjoy being torn limb from limb by an angry environmentalist, then,** replies GK in his cold, dead voice. He tosses the cell phone over. **Get Carter on the phone. If he proves useful to me, you're off the hook.**

Sorelli doesn't catch it. He picks it up out of his lap, and frowns again. "I will have to call someone for the number." He does so. His second call becomes his third, and forth. "Carter. Joseph Sorelli is aware of the hour," He seethes into the mouthpiece. "That's what I thought."

After a few words, Sorelli puts a hand over the mouthpiece. "You wish to see him? Or merely speak."

**When he arrives, you leave. Not before,** states the Ghost flatly.

Sorelli sighs, the gesture seeming to suck all of the air out of his body. "Carter, you are going to get out of bed, and come to this address. And will they be prying those golf clubs from your cold dead fingers as you have had an 'accident' like your two colleages? No, they are not my doing. Mine are being claimed too. Get here. Now. Kiss your wife, just in case, Carter." He clicks the phone off, and sets it down beside him. "Pleased?"

Thomas inclines his head. **I would wipe you and your kind from the face of the earth, were you not valuable to me as leads to men like Carter at Dew Chemical. Men of legitimate power and wicked ways are the true danger. We will wait.**

Joseph merely smiles. "That is what you do. Because this is what I do."

It's nerely an hour before Carter knocks on the door. A man in his fifties, hiding the bald spot underneath a five hundred dollar hair piece. He comes in like a whirlwind. "Sorelli? Sorelli, what's this about?" He looks around, noticing Guy, giving Tia a half glance, before walk toward the bedroom, where the mob boss is standing. The look that Joseph gives him stops him like a fist. "Stay." He instructs, then eases out of the room, leaving the Dew man looking lost.

Guy gives a bit of a grin as the fellow shows up. "Hello there. 'Bout time you showed up. We're uhm, well we know all about Revenant. And I'm sure you know a good deal about Revenant as well. So spill whatcha know, and we'll do our best to keep your heat beating in all the right places. Or we could just not do anything and you can end up having an arguement with a subway."

Carter turns to Guy, and instantly frowns. Then turns a little pale, then just seems aggitated. "Revenant? Is that some cockomamy name of a costumed nutjob who's killing my coworkers?"

Tia cracks her knuckles. Quite an interesting noise.. metal snapping against metal. She's the muscle here... yup.

Guy nods, "Seems like it. Although I don't think it's some kind of costumed nutjob. The last time I checked, being transparent, and fading out of existence isn't something that costumes can do."

Carter fidgets. "Well, I don't know what this is about. First Lucius, then Walter... everyone's startled. I knew it was murder. There's no possible way these events aren't orchestrated."

Guy says, "Oh no, they are orchestrated. I do believe I've seen the thing before. It's also after the Mob... which explains Joseph's presence... yah?"

**They are,** explains the Ghost, formerly silent. **You are here to explain how.**

"You're asking me? You're the ones who've seen who's doing it! It isn't as though I recieved a Memo on this. It could be someone wanting our business. Or ... oh hell, **I** don't know. I've never had any business with any super blather." Carter fumes. "If I knew, don't you think I would have taken care of this? Not stand around sitting on my hands waiting for the executioner?"

Thomas smiles slowly. **Revenant is killing both the Mafia and the members of Dew's board. The motive is revenge. Revenge for what?**

Guy says, "No, but you've probably done something. You had... dealings with the Family, as it were. You're bound to know who would want revenge for what."

Guy says, "Er... what the Ghost Knight said."

Carter frowns. "Revenge? Revenge, well, I don't know. A fired employee? Someone who was hurt by one of our products? Some angry environmentalists for the rare wiggletoed grasshopper being trampled by one of our trucks?" Though, as he continues on, his face does slack a little.

**You have a suspicion,** says the Ghost. **Speak.**

Tia nods, "Revenge doesn't work if the cause isn't known."

Carter is quiet. "We did step on some little worm. A couple of years ago. He had reviewed his books, and discovered some of the shipments were missing, and investigated it. Then found that we had dumped several dozen barrels to cut some costs. He threatened to take it to the press and police unless we removed them."

**And?** asks GK.

"And... Sorelli took care of the matter," Carter says matter-of-factly.

**His name?**

Silence. "I... honestly didn't bother to even remember."

Thomas nods, then balls up a fist and drives it into Carter's sternum, hard. As the man doubles over, GK grabs hold of his neck, and turns to Guy and Tia. **Sounds like our boy. Let's go check it out. We're bringing this trash with us.**

Thomas points a finger at Ricky as well. **You are advised to take a vacation. Consider a career change, as well. Or we'll be speaking again.** and with that he makes for the door, dragging the protesting Carter with him.

Tia blinks at GK, "We arn't garbagemen.. Why are we dealing with the trash?"

Thomas turns in response to the question. **Because nobody else can. If riff-raff like this are allowed to run this society, it will crumble to ruin.**

Guy nods. "Indeed. Besides, we're the goodguys. You know. And this way, we can put someone's soul to rest while keeping the lives of some scumbags around, who'll owe us. Big time."
