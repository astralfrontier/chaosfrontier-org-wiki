The Ghost Knight walks through the wall. The building beyond is a store, a bookstore with wall scrolls and other such more 'oriental' things; almost more for a tourist then actual authenticity. The bookshelf lay across the floor, a few books bent or cracked along the spine, and the shelf itself looking disheaveled, but if anything is broke or not cannot be told from a look. The store is empty of customers, the only inhabitants four men in sharp dress, nearly uniform. The only very noticable thing would be a yellow sash circling their waists. One is holding a lighter and a book. "...No no no," protets an older woman taking stance behind the counter.

Tia runs around the building, and bursts through the front door, surveying the same scene at GK. She ponders . o O ( GK needs backup. We should probably help ).

"You will," Speaks one of them, one of the asian men with a sharp braid. Then the door explodes inwards, and everything seems to stop, everyone turning to Tia. Without pause three reach for weapons, while the one with the book and lighter is slower, needing to put something down first.

Nothing need be put down; the Ghost is already in motion, his hand snatching away the book as he spins, his foot arcing swiftly for the ankles of the would-be vandal. The man topples and the vigilante completes his sweep, standing with the book in one gloved hand.

Tia looks around. She is still thinking. Of course, she sees nothing wrong with the scene until the folks draw their weapons. Foolish humans, always keying me in to when they're doing something they shouldn't. She points her arm at the gentleman who was threatening the bood, and needles spray from her fingertips.

Tia re aims as her original target goes down. She turns her arm to the next mook, and fires a spray of needles.

The spray of metallic spikes sail like an angry swarm of insects into one of the men, sending him back into a stack of books.

The man Ghost Knight downed rolls quickly on his side, moving as the auto-pistol comes free, putting him partially behind a bookcase, aiming at Tia. The other immediately steps behind a bookcase, his pistol aimed at Ghost Knight. The braided man moves in a quick motion, grabbing the woman by the shirt and yanking her over the counter, while poising a knife above her back. "Stop," He says simply, poising to watch Tia, but keeps the Ghost Knight in his field of vision.

Thomas holds up a hand toward Tia, patiently searching behind the knife-man for something heavy, looking as though he's been stopped by the tactic. A piece of statue behind the counter begins to levitate, buoyed by Tom's power, approaching by stealth. _Time, time, need more time.. Ah, that should do. Keep looking at me, boys..._

The Buddha has brought peace to many peoples, cultures and times. It brings a peace of sorts for the shopkeeper as the statue, about the size of a basketball, clobbers the knife-man from behind. The skull draws back in a smirk; Tom fully expects gunfire any tenth of a second now, but at least the momentary hostage should now be safe.

Braid is knocked back, his knife planting into the countertop as the shopkeeper lurches away. Crumpling to the ground, unmoving on the ground. The Uzi trained on Ghost Knight spits angrily, a rattle of three shells taking into the shelf beside and above him.

Tia runs over to the mook with a gun, her fleet feet stepping out of the way of the spray aimed at GK. Her hand deftly reaches out at the Israli gun, but a movement at the last moment, and she end up empty handed next to the mook.

Without his accustomed weapons, Tom feels a little strange. He launches a nasty kick for the hand holding the Uzi, but his approach isn't quite right. _Oh well,_ he reflects. _They're shooting at an armored automaton.. it'd have been much worse if they aimed for the owner._

The man who was guarding Tia was actually more hurt by the Knight's initial assault then he appears. He was driven to one knee in a wave of pain in one leg, and with Tia's speed, he was much to late. But as the Knight moves in, he rolls actually behind the counter, the shopkeeper having disappeared through a door leaving him to stand alone. He fires just as the second man ducks under Tia's grab, putting the gun nearly against her waist and firing point blank.

Elsewhere, the rattle of gunfire brings DarkGlow out of his contemplation of rocks, hard places and the strategic application of dynamite. _Any bets my gallant teammates are somewhere at the centre? And if they're not, they will be soon? Better put in an appearance. Besides, what lightens a mood better than a little blood?_ With an anticipatory grin, he probes with his mind to find a shadow in the direction of the shots. _That-a-way. Not too far. Hmmm... Ah._ He vanishes from the alley outside the restaurant and reappears on its opposite side. Invisible, he looks around for further indications of where the combat is taking place.

Tia looks down at the gun. "Ah.. Yes. Israel Military Industries most popular weapon. Ten rounds per second. 400 M/sec Muzzle velocity. 650 mm in length." She watches it simply minorly teny her trimmed tummy, "Too bad." She smiles down at him.

Tia reaches down, and pulls the gun out of the mooks' hands as the barrel stops flaring. She presses the relativly short barrel of the gun down with her fingers, wathing it bend 90 degrees. She looks down at The man, and start to get an animalistic look in her eye.

Leaping, Tom's hand slaps down on the counter to help him vault. He jumps sideways, twisting and spinning, his two feet meeting as one against the remaining gunman's chest. The man falls beneath him, and Tom lands almost directly above, feet on either side of the man's head.

DarkGlow's eyes narrow as he spots GhostKnight and Tia through a window in the wall opposite him. _And away we go..._ Still invisible, he teleports into an interior corner, and looks around for a willing--or even unwilling!--target.

Thomas reaches down, plucking the firearm from the twitching hand of the recovering gunman beneath him. He steps away casually, eyeing Tia, waiting to see how long these men will persist in their efforts.

Tia's other hand reaches out, and grabs the mook by the throat.. She squeezes rather tightly, while lifting him in the air, and off the ground. Incapacitate without killing? What's that?

**Unless you wish to be arrested, leave now,** states the Ghost emphatically, his voice rolling through the shop. **Do not return. Tia, we're done.**

Tia's gunman gurgles and kicks for several moments until the lack of air, bloodflow, and crushing pain cause him to black out. The shopkeeper comes out from the door behind the counter, shotgun in hand. She surveys the room for a moment, before calling out, "Who going to pay for this?"

Thomas holds up a hand toward the shopkeeper, then turns to Tia. **Please remove these men for the police to pick up. I'll take care of this.**

The woman nods once, and relaxes her grip on the weapon. She does not, however, put it down.

Tia nods to GK, and starts with the one she still has a hold of. Placing the gentleman outside, and laying the bent gun beside him. SHe moves on to the next. She makes a note to disable any firearms she sees.

The lone concious man - full of needles, one pinning his hand to his chest - doesn't put up much of a fight. He barely makes a noise as Tia approaches, and just bleeds on the sidewalk.

Meanwhile, GK moves himself to the center of the room, glancing about for a few moments. He holds out his arms, then, and things begin to move. Books return themselves slowly to their shelves; shelves return themselves to their upright place. He begins moving toward the bullet-holes, "curing" them by extracting the shells and restoring the structure of the wall.

The shopkeeper stares at the Knight as though he had grown a second head, and can do nothing but barrage him with words of appreciation. In the distance, sirens wail.

With an internal sigh of disappointment, DarkGlow blinks invisibly outside to wait for the other two to clean up. _If you get to the party late, don't expect to get any candy. Check. I knew we were missing out of vital life lessons when we were never allowed to go out trick-or-treating on Hallowe'en..._ The sirens catch his attention, and he steps forward out of the shadows. "Time to go, yeah?" he calls to GhostKnight and Tia.

Tia turns to DG, and looks at him, "Oh? Why?" She asks, standing there, looking sorta dubmly at him. . o O ( What's that siren mean, anyway? )

**Not until this is finished,** replies GK absently, his hand hovering over a damaged vase, slowly pulling the pieces together and applying his uncanny mastery of the material to unite them again. **With men and pottery, it is better to put right than to destroy wholly.**

DarkGlow shrugs, jerks a thumb over his shoulder and says, "The cops are coming. Hear the sirens? My experience with cops tells me they tend to arrest people first and ask questions later. Rather pointed questions, too."

Tia looks at DG, "Oh. Local law enforcement." She nods understandingly. Then looks at GK, "Steve is of the opinion that people cannot be changed." She states.

DarkGlow laughs, harshly. "Sure they can. Change 'em from being alive to being dead. Did that a time or two yourself, what, yesterday?"

**Where there is life, there is hope,** replies the Ghost, coldly enough. **Let's go.**

Once more the shopkeeper stressing her gratitude to GK, she then disappears into the back.

"And where there's hope, disappointment necessarily follows..." DarkGlow whispers, too softly to be heard. With another shrug, he compliantly follows.

Thomas pauses, looks back, then disappears as well, moving back into the shop to speak for a minute or less. He returns, then, seemingly satisfied. **Now we're ready. Time to speak to our patron.**

DarkGlow puts in, "What about Guy? There's no reason to leave him with the guy with the notebook. Like I said, there's nothing suspicious."

**It is suspicious, DarkGlow. Just not productive of results. Let him enjoy his meal. Anyway, there's something we need to discuss...** GK seems almost hesitant, his voice rippling with hesitation.

DarkGlow considers flippancy, or even cutting sarcasm, but instead contents himself with a simple, "In private, back at the warehouse, I assume? Lead on. Or, rather, see you there shortly." With a casual wave, he strolls off.

The three return to the original warehouse where Shawtae was taken. Lydon for the moment had the workers removed, claiming the building had been purchased. Shawntae relays the information that Lydon left before going to his interview; here the group can use until a better place is found, or atleast, built. Shawntae's snacking on a sandwich at the table the room everyone has converged in.

Thomas continues his explanation, speaking mostly to DarkGlow but addressing the others as well. **The police. We shouldn't need to be afraid of them coming, when we broke up visitors from a protection racket. We can equal the power of the police, but we are not corruptible by simple money. Any of us could earn whatever we sought, if money was all that we wanted,** he says. **We need recognition - from someone in power - that what we are doing is for the public good, ultimately. That recognition is something Lydon can accomplish for us. I am not suggesting we become the Champions. I am suggesting that we have whatever we need so that when badges are flashed, there are not handcuffs waiting for us as well.**

DarkGlow nods. "Frankly, the police don't scare me. However, you can always sink into the sewers if things get hostile, and I can slip away. Tia, though, might be tempted to resist, and unless I'm mistaken, has no easy way of getting out of a jam that doesn't involve, shall we say, collateral damage?"

Tia says, "Besides. What are the police going to make of me?" Steve comes out for a second, recognizable by the change in pitch and tone of ther voice, normally absent. "Anyway, All the gansters people get put in the crazy ward. 'There's a metal woman. She sprayed needles out of her fingers.'"

**While we might be capable of evading them, one way or another, I frankly would rather not be bothered by it, yes?** replies GK. **The men I am after - men like the Dew boardmembers - need to go to trial. For at least part of that I need, if not the cooperation of the police, at least a lack of active pursuit of me. We are not simply able to kill whomever we dislike.**

Shawntae looks over the three. "Well, getting some PR couldn't hurt either. I could set up a website." The thought makes him smirk. Pointing at Ghost Knight, "I a little thing set up on my computer to email me when they have a court date set."

DarkGlow clamps his jaw shut for a couple of seconds before answering, to make certain of his words. "Killing off enemies indiscriminantly merely gets you classed as a dangerous murderer. Getting the police to look the other way--or, hell, even help out if necessary--would be good, but you're talking serious power and influence. Does even Lydon have that kind of pull?"

**We will find out, when we talk to him. If not, then... we may need to make other arrangements. But do you agree this is a desirable goal, at least?** asks GK.

Shawntae shrugs. "I'm sorta not part of the 'official' gang so I can't say much."

Thomas nods. **You have your own life to lead. That was the promise.**

DarkGlow shrugs. "Desirable? Sure, why not--though I fully intent to continue to stay out of the limelight and below anyone's radar." _Too bloody late for that, you twit._ "Possible, though? Not my area."

**My intention is not to publicize us,** clarifies Tom. **That should not be a concern. No Web sites, no PR. Simply a... 'Get Out OF Jail Free' card?**

DarkGlow chuckles shortly. "Already got me one of those. I s'pose getting it stamped by some official muckety-muck wouldn't hurt, though."

Tia nods approvingly. Of course, she probably wouldn't goto jail anyway. But back to her manufacturers / Owners.

Thinking for a moment, GK continues. **We'll do what we can to stay subtle. Subtlety seems to be our forte' anyway.**

Thomas smiles suddenly, the skull contorting in that devilish leer. **I do know one thing we can do though, that requires no intervention of Lydon's. Anyone who's interested in coming with me is welcome to do so.**

"The last goose chase didn't work out so well," DarkGlow comments. "Where are you haring off to now?"

**The Champions.**

The Champion's headquarters - Homestead - is located near the center of MC. Homestead occasionally houses guided tours - of the areas allowed to be accessed by the public - so a small crowd mills around. The building itsel fis shiney and newaged, lacking windows - atleast on the first floor.

Thomas arrives, unusually attired. He's still wearing his black armor, and his long overcoat billows out behind him like night, rippling in the slight breeze. The way he carries himself is that of one of the knights of old, noble men who sallied forth to make treaties with their neighbors and rivals. His helmet is off, though; in its place is the head of a man in his 40's, with black hair and dark eyes, the classically shaped face of European aristocracy. He presents himself at the front door. **We wish to speak to the Champions,** he announces, without moving his lips, trusting his dead voice to identify himself to whoever's monitoring.

Tia follows GK up to the building, and looks abuot her. She wonders. What is this, what are we doing, where are we, who are the Champiions. Of course, it hasn't ever been her style to question before, so she simply follows.

Diffidence masking terror, DarkGlow trails the two, alternately wondering what in God's name skull-face--whatever face he's wearing now--thinks he's doing and reviewing bus schedules out of town. Areas of deep shadow are firmly locked in his mind, and the knowledge of them pulls at him with almost a physical force, but still he continues.

The doors, a casual looking glass, are of much, much more sturdier make if the Ghost Knight probes for a moment. These doors click after nearly twenty seconds of silence, sliding open like any automated door installed in a public building.

Thomas strides in, without waiting for any further invitation, gesturing curtly to Tia to follow. _And now to see if they'll listen to reason..._

DarkGlow walks after, deliberately not trying to copy GhostKnight's confidence but aiming rather for a cool casualness. With a silent sight, he lets the hope they'd be simply turned away go.

The entranceway is bright and clean. There are cases with 'troupies', souvineers from battles or cases, momentos or past costumes. Stepping into the foyer is a man in his thirties that looks like a security guard from hell. He doesn't say anything immediately, merely nodding until the sound of foot steps suited for an elephant come out of the hall behind him. The man standing there looks like a wrestler... coated in iron. It almost gleams in the light. He turns towards the three, and takes a moment to blink at Tia, giving her a curious glance. Before the baratone voice booms forward to them. "Hello. Welcome to Homestead."

Thomas inclines his head. "We're here to make a deal with the Champions," he says evenly, the voice cold but alive. "This concerns Dew Chemicals, and other matters."

Tia looks over at the metal giant, listening to what GK says. She ponders . o O ( I just hoe he doesn't decide to follow me home... )

The man, known as Ironclad, gives a thoughtful expression. "Not all of the Champions are here currently. You would be asked to wait while I attempt to contact them. Or else return when everyone is here?"

Thomas looks around him. "We will wait, if hospitality permits," he says, calmly enough.

DarkGlow stands silent, thinking dejectedly that he'd probably have no more success piercing _that_ hide than any other metal-clad or -coated opponent recently.

A glance back to the security guard from Ironclad, who reiceves a curt nod. There's only a moment of hesitation, before the booming voice returns, "Why yes. There is a seating area this way," He informs, and turns, walking down the hall he had come from.

The room on the side of the hall is large. A wide, semi-circle table takes up one side, while chairs and mike stands are present. Obviously they've installed a press release room Inside their residence. Ironclad makes a broad gesture. He inquires about refreshments, before walking off in the loud, clanging stroll. It is not too long until those loud steps are heard again, Ironclad entering with three figures behind him. Sapphire, the most outspoken and blatant of the Champions, a ravenhaired woman in a casual leather jacket and jeans. Behind her, a tall powersuiter, Defender, the 'official' leader of the crew. Behind him, a black man in an odd getup, consisting of goggles, a head mask, and a dark blue outfit walks in; a loose member of the group, Kinetik. "I am sorry," Ironclad informs, "We could not get everyone; engagements, unreachable, or other circumstances permitted."

DarkGlow nods gravely, then checks the motion when he realizes it might get him noticed. _It's quite all right,_ he thinks sardonically, _four of you are more than enough to hand us our sorry asses--probably before I can blink away, too._

Thomas rises, shaking his head. "It is not necessary. You will decide amongst yourselves in this matter, at whatever time you see fit, I am sure." He pauses a moment, then raises his hand. The black glove he wears begins to coil itself off his hand, shaping itself into a passable sculpture of Ironclad after a few seconds. **You may know me,** he says, then resumes the more 'human' speech. "It is doubtful you know my associates. We prefer to keep it that way. However, our anonymity works against us, at times. When our team meets with successes that involve matters of politics and law - areas we have no official pull in - we are willing, I believe, to turn the \`collar' over to the Champions for further handling. Your team launders our successes, making them palatable to the public. You receive civic acclaim, we retain our secrecy. We will provide enough evidence on a given case to resolve it to the satisfaction of the law, if we can." He pauses again, to let all this sink in.

That seems to surprise those who's faces are visible. Defender steps forward. "That depends, Ghost Knight," he informs with a moment of hesitation. "You're reputation kinda proceeds you." "You're a very bad man," Kinetik quips with a grin. "... yes," Defender goes on. "You often handle things that are very in the shadows. Organized crime, corruption, so forth. We have someone who works with us that does similar, who I'm sure would not mind a word with you when the chance comes up." Sapphire rolls her eyes at that. "But for the most of us, that's... not exactly our area of expertise. Especially if we suddenly become the target for who you decide to play with, if you know what i mean. We may have our hands full with some things; we don't need to be shot out of the air by the New Purple Gang... but the offer in general is tempting."

"We fought the New Purple Gang to a standstill. The next time, we will be the better planners," says Tom, calmly enough. "Your powers and skills are impressive enough, but you are shackled by the need for respectability. We are not." He waves his hands, indicating those with him. "We are not evil people. We simply have... a different balance of respect for law versus justice. We are not your enemies. I doubt we will be your friends. But I want you to consider us allies."

"Right. But you understand the concern." "I've seen enough mob movies to start checking for bombs in the jet," Sapphire informs, leaning casually against the table. "... Right," Defender nods. "We'll think it over. Let you know." After a moment, "So, where do we get ahold of you?" Kinetik looks over Ghost Knight. "I would have thought the nearest cemetary, but you clean up pretty good under there."

Thomas holds up his other hand. Bits of material begin to emerge from the glove - bits of paper, and ink. Before the eyes of the Champions it resolves itself, flowing together like liquid, into a business card, which Tom extends casually. It has nothing but a phone number and a note: "The team with no name".

Defender strides forward and collects it, pocketting it in a compartment. "It will be considered. Thanks." Ironclad speaks up, looking towards Tia. "Pardon me. Where are you from?"

Tia looks over at IronClad, and blinks once or twice, "I honestly don't know." She states, and continues to stare at IC.

He seems dissapointed, but nods. "Thank you." The others merely turn to the metal giant, who can do nothing but spread his hands.

"It is a question which we are investigating," fills in Tom, casually. "You may wish to ask about it again, if the occasion permits."

"I was wondering if we were from the same place... or close," Ironclad informs.

DarkGlow glances quickly between Tia and Ironclad, feeling as if he'd just dodged something the size of a missile. _A little longer, and I can say I survived a run-in with the Champions. Not that there's anyone I'd say that to, but nevertheless..._ He looks longingly at the door, not that anyone could recognize the look under his face's layer of shadow--which is just how he likes it.

Tia looks at Ironclad, "I doubt it." She mentions, and shrugs to join her companion.

Thomas inclines his head again, then begins to walk. He doesn't look back; he's confident enough in the proposition, and also confident that whatever personal reputation he has, the results the team has brought in will be more influential than any social discomfort the Champions might have with the team itself. They, after all, do not wear badges either.
