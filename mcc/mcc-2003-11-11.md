MU's own Finly Stadium has quite a few people there. Not reporters or police, but the local team practicing. Other students and citizens are milling around, either looking for souvenirs of the recent Foxbat sighting, or doing nothing of remote interest. The procession leads down the tunel which Blake had indicated, ending several yards from the right turn in a burnt circle in the middle of the hall. A janitor is kneeling, trying to scrape it off.

While Guy interviews people around the stadium - with his usual degree of personal discretion and restraint - the Ghost crouches near the burned area, while Ming and DarkGlow look on. **I would appreciate you pausing in your work,** he directs to the janitor, while his senses probe the mark for clues as to the apparent disappearance of Lydon Yamaguchi. Just what happened here?

The janitor jumps. "Augh. Don't creep up on me like that." He straightens his jumpsuit and looks around. "Man, lotta frea... costumed guys here today."

Ming just kind stands by, watching Ghost Knight. What else is she going to do, anyway? She will just loiter about and wait for some request for her help. And she will resist the urge to ask for more autographs. After all, Ghost Knight did turn her down, last time.

DarkGlow shrugs eloquently, glancing down at his black cloak and the leathers beneath. "'Freaks' is fairly accurate, I should think," he comments sardonically. "Which of our other... colleagues has been around?"

The charred marks aren't the only thing changed. The air seems slightly smoggier, as does the walls, and after inspection, definet air pollution molecules sticking to the air and ceiling, flung wide.

"Well," Replies the janitor, scratching the back of his head, "There was that Batfox guy who was here earlier. He ran past me as fast as he could. Apparently some guy in a birdy tin can had come and send him flying." He points back. "Went out an emergency exit up ahead, sent the fire alarm off."

"The tin can--heh--knocked... er, Batfox around?" queries DarkGlow.

The janitor shrugs. "No tellin'. I was coming around the corner when the lune ran by me at full tilt. Then saw the tin can just stand there for a minute and then leave." He looks at Ghost Knight. "So what do you figure did this?" Nudging the burnt mark with his foot. "Didn't hear any explosion or nothin'."

Ming looks over to DarkGlow, then back to the circle. She taps a finger on her lips, staying good and quiet as she thinks. She bends down to look at the circle, studying it carefully to see if it is a fine burn or imperfect.

DarkGlow glances at the burn and mentally shrugs. _Not exactly my area. Not that examining firedoors tops my resume, either, but maybe Foxbat dropped something or... uh, something._ Leaving GhostKnight and his new friend, he wanders up the way Foxbat had previously run, keeping his eyes open and his mind sort of attentive.

_Emergency exit? Check. Hallway? Check. Well, this was useful._ DarkGlow wanders back.

_Well this is pretty much a dead end. Evidence-wise anyway. Have a bit of a hunch though..._ Guy gives just a bit of a shrug as he locates the others near the burn mark. "Oh hey... why're you guys staring at that big black spot on the ground?"

Ming draws out a small container and one of her cards. She scrapes the edge of it against the burn mark. "I might as well try to run an analysis," she mutters softly. She also thinks it's about time she got a super hero outfit of her own and maybe a cool name to go with it.

"Ghost Knight." A familiar voice comes from behind. "And here I thought you wern't in conjunction with Tengu." Arlene Raymond walks into view, a pleased with herself look on her face.

DarkGlow shrugs at Guy. "Dunno. GhostKnight has been meditating over it for a few minutes--well, either that or he's more cavalier with his naps than I'd-- Uh, hello," he says, turning and addressing the newcomer. "And you are?"

"I don't think anything terribly conclusive can be determined from a big splotch o'

"I don't think anything terribly conclusive can be determined from a big splotch o'burnt stuff on the ground. Still if you like..." Guy shrugs a bit, and gives a bit of a nod towards Arlene Raymond. "H'lo again."

DarkGlow glances at Guy. "And she is...?"

**What do you want?** GK's voice is as impartial and cold as ever, but now his body language adds to the effect as well.

"If I'm not mistaken, she works for th' paper. Had stuff on GK as well as on that bit with the mafia not long ago, and the whole Revenant thing." Guy gives one of his winning smiles.

"That is correct," Arlene answers without looking at DarkGlow. "I want to know what happened." A gesture towards the black mark. "More importantly, I would like to know why Tengu was here, and then broke into Greymalkin Inc's building. And why you're investigating it if you aren't on his team?"

**Because a crime has been committed,** answers the Ghost, rising to his full height and turning. **The suit that was used in the Greymalkin break-in was not the Tengu suit itself, but a copy or imperfect duplicate. I have confirmed this.**

"Arlene Raymond!" blurts Ming, the name finally sinking in. She will just scoot on over to the woman, "It's a pleasure to meet you! I'm so fascinated by your work. I imagine you don't get to hear it often, but I for one am grateful that people like you are out there, digging out the truth behind the stories!" Already she's reaching for that little autograph book. Oi vey.

"Really. What evid-" Ming sidetracks her enough to draw an 'I'm Busy' glare that has deterred minor criminals before. "Yes, hello, thank you, you're welcome." Swiveling back on the Ghost Knight, "What evidence is there of a false Tengu?"

Minor criminals? Hah! Ming is not so easily deterred. "Wow, you are so dedicated! It's amazing," she says. One might think though, that this time fan-girls is playing it up. "I really envy those who work with someone so skilled. You must really inspire everyone around you, Ms. Raymond."

"Thank you," Arlene replies without even looking, her attention staying on Ghost Knight.

**Two things. First, a difference in tactics was noted. I have reviewed Tengu's combat history and concluded that the pilot of the suit that attacked Greymalkin was not its normal pilot. Second...** He pauses, then beckons with his hand toward the janitor's bucket. Water rises, forming itself into an intricately detailed image of the Tengu combat armor after a few seconds, hovering in the air. **There were minor differences in design here.. here and here,** he indicates, pointing with one finger at the apparition. **These are differences as of twelve hours ago or less.**

Arlene nods. "All right. And what makes you think it isn't merely stolen? A chop shop can have a car with different wheels, fenders, and a shabby paint job in under four hours; couldn't alterations be made within half a day?"

Ming hmmss, holds out her book and the pen experimentally, just to see how much this woman can do and understand without paying any attention at all. Not like she has anything else to do, right?

**Because security records indicate that the suit has remained undisturbed for that period of time,** replies GK, slowly.

The book is claimed and flipped open a fourth of the way. The barest glance downward confirms the page is empty, and 'Arlene Raymond, On the Job' is written down without pause. "Is that so. I'll quote you on that."

Ming takes the book back, shrugs, and wanders a ways off to think. She'll just look around, not sure if she's supposed to do anything or not.

The reporter's attention shifts like the wind. "Excuse me," She directs at Guy, "You look familiar. You were at the safe house last week. Are you officially working with the Ghost Knight?"

**Oh yes, one other thing. This woman knows everything there is to know about me,** the Ghost adds, with a perfectly flat tone, gesturing towards Ming as she moves away.

DarkGlow looks on with mild horror as Guy is pinned like a deer caught in headlights. _Time for a tactical retreat, before I'm trapped, too..._ As cautiously as if in full combat, he slowly sidles away.

While Guy seems to be distracted, Arlene takes a survey around. DarkGlow seems to have disappeared. She holds up a hand as if to say 'Hold that thought' to Guy, and crosses to Ming. "Excuse me. What is your name? I have the last interview with Shadow Boxer before the battle of Detroit. It was never printed. I need to know who to mail it to."

"Me? Officially working with the Ghost Knight?" Guy ponders this. "No I don't think so. I mean I suppose you could write that if y'wanted to, but, there ya have it." Guy looks around, wondering, _Maybe I can get some kind of idea as to what happened here, while this broad is distracted by the other broad._

Ming looks up at Arlene for a moment. "Hmm? I'm Ming Tiaoning, just a scientist and professor here at the university, and I maintain what is likely the greatest information warehouse of supernatural sightings and information that exists. I'm always interested in more information."

"Thank you. I will get back to you." Replies Arlene. She turns to the Ghost Knight. "Greymalkin is very tight lipped about what happened. You have obviously been there. Could you tell me what happened?"

After the summary is given to Arlene, the four move outside with nothing conclusive. Until Shawntae comes over the radio. "Uh, Guys? Apparently Lydon's... um... at work. Or just got there, according to his secretary."

Thomas nods. **Right. We're on the way.**

Yamaguchi Corp is accessed through the back way for the four. Lydon is standing in the lab, in a blue jean jacket and slacks, walking around to touch everything, look at it as if new, at least DarkGlow observes. When the Ghost Knight gets there, the corporate head turns, staring.

Ming just tags along again, not sure what is expected, but enjoying the trip anyway. If nothing else, she's getting to work with real super heroes, and that's enough for her, even if she can't help them in any useful manner. The fact that this is likely to draw a lot of attention to her is starting to register in her mind, though.

"So," DarkGlow comments casually, "just decide to get away from it all for a bit?"

Lydon looks aside to DarkGlow, before turning back to Ghost Knight. "You're not dead."

**Take a pulse,** invites the Ghost, extending one arm. Tom smiles inwardly - diverting the arteries and veins away from the surface should be a breeze, if the man actually takes him up on it.

"No, you are still moving." Lydon steps back, looking around. "It's all still here."

DarkGlow steps towards Lydon. "Everyone's here, and everyone's okay. _You're_ the one who went walkabout. Anything you can tell us?"

Ming enters with Guy, not really sure who she is meeting, save for a name. Nor does she precisely know what she is supposed to do. Looking at the man in so much confusion gives her an idea. "Is it okay for me to check him out? He looks a bit dazed," Ming says.

DarkGlow glances at her. "'Check him out'? You a doctor?"

Ming grins at DarkGlow, answering, "Something like that."

Lydon glances at DarkGlow. "I don't know you. But if you're with him, then there's no concern." The man turns to Ming, then stops at seeing Guy, freezing. "Ghost Knight. This is a different... world, time, from where I am from, correct?"

DarkGlow exchanges a glance with GhostKnight. "Um, time for a bit of a lie down, I think. How about we go to your office? There's gotta be a couch in there, right?"

Ming steps closer to Lydon, "Just relax, I'm here to help. I want to make sure you are alright." And if he is sane, then what? Stupid Blake and his crazy devices. Looks like the fool found something real this time.

DarkGlow intercepts the woman, putting a hand on her arm. "I don't know you--leave him alone." He looks a question at GhostKnight.

Lydon is gravitating towards the table displaying the original Tengu's suit, while watching the interplay. His eyes move to Ghost Knight as well.

**DarkGlow.** The vigilante's voice is softer than usual. **She is trustworthy.**

DarkGlow shrugs and steps away. "As you say," he replies, tone cool.

Ming steps towards Lydon and says, "Just try to relax. I am going to try and make sure you are unhurt. Your cooperation would be of immense aid to me."

Ming hmms softly, stepping away from Lydon slowly. "He is telling the truth, and as far as I can tell he is not ill." She is still searching, wondering just how this man got here. "How did you find yourself in our world?" she asks softly, trying to bait the information to the surface.

The memory of flying through the air above a smoke stack shooting out smoke before hovering in the hall of the Stadium among a bit of lightning enters Lydon's thoughts, and Ming picks it up. "I... was dealing with Greymalkin, and then I was here. And there was some babbling idiot who ran away from me."

"Babbling idiot.. Foxbat, I wager," murmurs Ming. "I think that we may have something very dangerous to contend with," she says. "Apparently Blake's object really does work, and who knows what it might pull into our world next."

DarkGlow's eyes suddenly narrow dangerously at Ming, and his thoughts turn cold and black for a second before, with an almost physical effort, he drags his mind away. He suppresses an impulse to look at GhostKnight. _Maybe he wasn't kidding about her knowing everything about him. Poor bastard. Just hope the same doesn't happen to me..._

An urge to remove the threat of Ming enters DarkGlow's mind. Distrust, fear that she might unravel his mind like an onion, or hold him helpless to be handed over to another... Shadows all most writhe, waiting for the command to attack.

Thomas thinks for a moment. **We cannot resolve this until we find the Lydon we know. Sir, where did this occur?**

Ming reaches out to Thomas' mind with a passive link, letting him either open up and accept it or resist. Should she be allowed inside, she will pass on the images she picked-up from Lydon's mind, though to her they did not seem incredibly helpful.

Thomas nods, thinking for a few minutes. **Guy, call Dr. Blake. Tell him he is on tap and that we will be requiring his services. DarkGlow, go pick up Dr. Blake and bring him here after he impolitely refuses Guy, which he will. Ming, maintain rapport with me. Mr. Yamaguchi, I want you to stay put.**

"It occured over a factory I learned Greymalkin was manufactoring gravitech I made, intending to use them as weaponry." Lydon pauses. ".... IF they caught him, he would be in jail." A sad smile towards the Ghost Knight. "...Don't worry."

DarkGlow folds his arms across his chest, hunches his shoulders and bows his head, trying to supporess adreneline-induced shudders, while vaguely hoping it looks like he's deep in thought. _Calmly, you moron! Calmly!_ He wills the shadows still, desperation lending strength to his efforts. _Think of Lydon! Other Lydon, Lydon from somewhere else. Couldn't just be kidnapped, could he, no he had to go get himself replaced. Wonder if the suit came from there as well. If Greymalkin controls Yamaguchi, then the suit might be theirs, and the pilot might have good reason to know exactly what to steal from Greymalkin here..._

DarkGlow glaces up, startled. "What? Blake? Uh, sure. I can do that." Almost fleeing, he moves towards the nearest shadow.

Professor Blake is a little disheaveled, not as drunk as he was the earlier day. And he has had enough time to stew out the intiial oanger and outrage from being dragged to this office room where ever in the world he's been kidnapped from. Instead he is nursing on a glass of water, clearing his head from the dull headache.

**Dr. Blake. This is the product of your research,** explains GK, briefly explaining the situation and gesturing at the copy-Lydon. He gestures to the rest of the group, gathered about him. **Is our Lydon still in this 'world', or would he have been transported out?**

Ming hmms quietly, wondering how someone else would know how to use this thing, anyway. And of all the people to draw in, this man. Purpose? Or accident?

The Professor is floored. He spends some time just looking at Lydon and back at mumbling to himself. Finally Ghost Knight's question stirs him. "The tests I had ran were with small objects, letters, all coming back sometimes different, sometimes normal. I was going to give an official demonstration..." A shake of his head. He would be in the dimension that this man is from. There is a way to bring those from the other dimensions all here, but it would require something reflective to break the beam up into several smaller portions..."

**Make it happen,** directs GK, trying to muster some patience. **What do you require?**

Ming mutters softly, her anger noticeable, "I can't believe you would let something so dangerous sit around where anyone might steal it."

"My device," Dr Blake says with a sigh. "It was a prototype. I have the schematics on another computer. My work computer was recently hacked... I was watching it day and night! And when I wasn't, I left it in an Air port. With Terrorist scares up all over the bloody nation, no one would dare rob the place." He looks up. "Wait. You want your man back, yes?"

"The next time he uses it, the last one returns. Think of the walls of dimensions like a... a cup." He takes the plastic cup, and dents it in. "See? Normal old dent. Now," He makes another dent, just beneath it. "A little dent doesn't do anything, like a small object. But," Blake dents in a bigger dent beside the first one, and the original one pops out. "The next time it is used, those two will switch places."

Blake adds, "Or rather, used on another item as large as a human."

**A dangerous toy,** observes GK. **But very well. If it should happen, are you capable of determining the location of the device?**

"Ah... well, I could." Blake leans back, considering. "Something to detect each use would take me a few days, but the patterns are rather easy to find."

Ming strays to her own thoughts, wondering the most dangerous thing that could be transported across. "So you are suggesting that whatever is pushed across comes back, just not necessarily as itself, but as itself from another world? If I did this with a computer or with a certain person, they might have information that is extremely valuable."

"Or they could be completely different from what you are suspecting." Blake informs. "These are the same person in another dimension. That same person may be someone completely different, remember these are Different worlds. They could be a garbage man or a senator or dead."
