Newspaper in hand, Thomas Temple loiters unremarkedly by a payphone outside of one of the city's many parks. Casting an eye over at the children playing yonder, he shrugs to himself. _For them, and for those like them, I do what I do... so children can play at peace and not be afraid._ With that he fumbles the receiver off hook and begins dialing, taking the number from the unconventional advertisement found therein. "Skullface indeed," he mumbles.

Two rings, before a pleasant voice picks up. "Hello, Pandemonium Night club. This is Jezzabell speaking."

Thomas sighs to himself. _What the hell?_ Nevertheless his synthetic voice is all business. **It is I.**

There's a brief pause on the other line. "Oh! You must be... yes, I'll patch you into Mr. Davidson right away. Hold please." Jazz muzak enters the background for thirty seconds, before a casual voice draws across the reciever. "Hello, is this the Ghost Knight?"

**Decide for yourself,** the dead voice replies. **What is your business with me?**

"Mr Knight," Says the voice, sounding older, not deep enough to be baritone. "My name is Luther Davidson. You see, I've been looking over your ... appearances, and I've seen that you're a vigilante for the people. Not just putting down crime, but," Some papers shuffle. "Like this instance a few months ago where you straightened up a slum lord down in North Detroit. I once was a man not unlike yourself... well, at least I did what you do. So I understand where you might be coming from. I want to make you an offer."

**Speak.** Thomas frowns internally, wracking his memory for references. Davidson, Davidson..

"Detroit day is next Wednesday. As a celebrational event, I'm going to be hosting a hero 'tournament' in my club. Some out of town heros are coming in, some local faces, to fight, put on a show. I'll be selling tickets, and recording the tournament to be sold. Half the proceeds go to the Beautifying Detroit project - cleaning up North Detroit - and the Building Bridges program. It's a program that helps the city's young people of varying races and walks of life to come together and do things, to understand one another. It's worked in other cities but we need funding here. The other half of the proceeds go to the damages."

**And you wish me to participate.** GK's voice is flat as Tom frowns, puzzling over this. His paranoia flares, but at the same time, so does his pride. For several seconds they vie for control... **I accept.**

"Great! That's groovy. If you want to come on down to the club and take a look at it, meet me, anything, let me know." He offers his cell phone number. "Call me anytime. I'd like to see everyone participating by the day before the event, to follow out the rules, explain the setup, all that. Sound good?"

**I will be there momentarily.**

"Oh - all right. Club's empty right now, so that's just fine. It's in the Theater center on the corner of Vine avenue and Carlington street."

Pandemonium was once a warehouse, now remodeled into some musical culture explosion. The building itself is metal and brick, but painted a moody magenta with indigo and vermillion. A neon-red sign in cursive announces the name. According to a few posters decorating the front, every night is dedicated to a different 'type' of clubbing. From the hard-beating thump of techno and heavy metal for dancing, to a variety night, to open mike-night for the local bands, even a retro-disco night. The parking lot - one that takes up the corner and across the street - is relatively empty.

The Ghost Knight emerges from the sidewalk in front of the club, then begins walking for the doors. Then through them. Privately, Thomas wars with his remaining reservations about going through with this, but still he proceeds.

The club itself is large. Tiny little tables and tall chairs circle the iridescent dance floor that could qualify as basket ball court with it's size. The second floor is gutted, offering tables above a view to the floor beneath. At four corners are upraised platforms. A set of TVs are set above the stage in an arch, while up above a plethora of lights hang, off. The building is nearly deserted; two janitors work at cleaning off tables while another mops the dance floor. A sizable area behind the main room consists of the office, filled with a handfull of people.

"Mr Knight." The voice is the same on the phone. Down one of the two sets of stairs from the upper floor walks a black man who looks in his later fourties, or perhaps early fifties. The age seems to have no grip on his movements which are comfortable and almost spry. The suit he wears is a shade beneath canary yellow, but just as bright, complimenting the white shirt and robin's egg blue tie. "Thank you for coming on down."

**You wish for me to fight for charity.** The ghostly voice is flat, exact. **Is this correct? If so, it seems that you endanger your audience, given your choice of combatants.**

Davidson walks on over after clearing the stairs, shaking his head. The smile he offers looks natural on his face. "Not quite. My rolladex is filled with all the fellow heros, freedome fighters, good natured techheads, all that, from all my travels and meetings. I grabbed the horn and called up a man I know who can supply me with a force field generator." He points to varying areas across the building. "We will have them set up to prevent any damage to the audience, while offering a varying field."

Thomas nods slowly. **And what of those I injure?** The question is confident, almost brazenly so, but if nothing else it'll remind this man of the reputation of who he's dealing with. Tom smiles to himself - _smoke and mirrors, that's my real power._

"Medical staff," He replies without missing a beat. "I ask that anyone volunteering to participate let us know about their weaknesses, allergies, physiology and all that, so the people on hand will know what not to do. There's also a healer in town, helping some paralyzed guy, and he said he'd do it in case there are any serious injuries." After a moment, "And I'd like no body to go for the kill here. This is a show, like wrestling or sparing. No lethal measures. It's all in good fun for those watching."

**Very well.** Thomas reflects for a moment. **I have one condition. I want the list of participants.**

"That's fine," Davidson says with a smile. "We're still waiting for call backs from a few, but I can get one to you within the next ... two days." He extends his hand. "Call me Luther if you want, my man. And sorry about that 'calling you out' in the newspaper bit; getting your attention is a little hard."

The Ghost makes no effort to shake hands. **It's meant to be. I am not offended. I will call you in two days.**

Luther lets his hand fall back, but his smile doesn't wane. "Glad to have you aboard Mr Knight. Thank you."

The spectral figure inclines his head, turns and walks out. Thomas chuckles inwardly. _This ought to be rich..._

Under false names, Ambiance and Daniel are given joined rooms at the Adam's Mark hotel. Rather then going out somewhere, it was decided ordering Chinese and having it delivered would be far more simpler and attract less attention. With no bags, the two alternate DarkGlows move the chairs from one room into the other before the three simply regard one another in a few moments of awkward silence.

"So..." DarkGlow says around a mouthful. "Got any places this good back home?"

"The China Inn," Ambiance replies over his chopsticks. "It doesn't do takeout, but is a well-stocked buffet." Daniel considers while inspecting his seasame. "I actually live right near Chinatown, so just about anywhere you go."

DarkGlow glances at the hooded cloak draped across the bed. "Buffet... Yeah, I usually--well, never--eat in. Guess this means that you guys a) have Chinese b) they make food and c) it's somewhat like this." He nods thoughtfully. _What'd you expect, twit?_ "Guess if each of our worlds or whatever has us, they've gotta be pretty close to one another in other respects. Wonder if we're the only things different..."

"Well," Daniel starts, "I can definetly tell the difference. There's no America. I mean, there **is**, but America stayed a colony and continued to be English. The English own the majority of the World's nations." Ambiance quirks a brow. "Well, there probably is other differences. I mean, do you have the Endelands? It's an island nation off the pacific coast."

DarkGlow shrugs. "Nothing named that that I'm aware of. 'Course the orphanage didn't have a world globe and I was always far more concerned with where I was than anywhere else. If I couldn't see it from a window, it didn't exist--emotionally, anyway. Our first few walkabouts were rather eye-opening, and when we actually... err, left for good, the city seemed to go on forever. I remember being anxious the first time we hit a new town, and downright scared of crossing the state border--what if they didn't speak English? Silly, I know, but self-centred only scratches the surface of what we were like..."

Daniel leans forward. "You're an orphan?"

Ambiance just watches DarkGlow, swallowing his eggroll. "How old where you when you got out? Who took you in?" He's less anxious about the answer, his face almost sad, yet knowing.

DarkGlow nods blandly in Daniel's direction, but Ambiance's expression pricks at DarkGlow. "Dunno exactly. Fourteen or fifteen would be about my guess. My birthday's August 31st, but the adults gave contradictory answers when I was a kid and when I questioned them, they seemed to more reach a consensus than actually know themselves. This was like them telling me my parents died, but never giving details for fear of my 'delicate' psyche." His expression hardens. "Not that I cared. As for who took me in, no one. But we made out all right, just the same."

"Ah. I was in an orphanage in Wyoming. I was never picked up, and left when I was eighteen or seventeen; when they decided I was old enough." A shake of Ambiance's head. "I didn't like what I had saw there. Degenerates, criminals, a lot of people who had been hurt in their life. I wanted to stop that." A soft glow eminates from his hand before focusing like a beam along the tabletop.

Daniel says nothing, sitting back in the chair and continuing to eat.

"It was better to just stay out of everyone's way, just fade into the background," DarkGlow counters, not forcefully, but not quietly either. "Me against Matt and Frankie was stupid, and me against the orphanage suicide. Me against the world? Inconceivable." He glances at Daniel. _He didn't even go that far. Did he want too badly to be like everyone else?_

A wry, old smile from Ambiance. "Look around you. Darkness is in every corner and under, above, below, beside everything. The world is made up of your playground. In the night, it is your kingdome, just like the day is mine. You're only in the background as much as you choose to be. Under the bed, or just beside the light."

Daniel squirms a little bit. "So, DarkGlow, what do you do? Or did you do? Y'know, before you met the skull face and the rest of them."

DarkGlow stares at Ambiance. "The night is no more mine than the day. I am _grey_. Utter blackness traps me as surely as a world of light." His eyes narrow dangerously. "I am _not_ your opposite." He flicks his head over to Daniel, but it's really still to Ambiance he speaks. "Thievery," he states, defiance creeping into his tone as much he as wants to keep his voice level, to better indicate no regret, no guilt. "We took what we needed and not a lot more. Coming out of an orphanage, you know you don't need much to survive. Later--" He has to stop himself from looking at Ambiance, from throwing it in his face. "--later we even worked for a cop, spying, getting evidence on drug dealers and so on." _'Course it turns out he wasn't a cop, and was really just playing us, but how were we supposed to know? A kindly smile, a few licks of praise--God in heaven, even with everything before, we were still so naive..._

This doesn't phase Ambiance, who merely spreads his hands. "The night that is pitch black is one with no light. Where there is light, there is people. And where there are people, there is you who can be there." A mere gesture of the light manipulator at the mention of the cop, seeming less disputed and more supported. "You're right, you're not my opposite. But there's a big gap between us."

Daniel leans back under DarkGlow's look, and frowns a little. "Oh." He looks away a second. "Well, I wasn't an orphan. My parents were just very... distant. So I had to do things for myself." A look back at the assassin. "We?"

DarkGlow grins, hard and fast. "Every light casts a shadow, and for every shadow there is that which must be lit. _Not_ so large a gap." _Put another way, no good deed goes unpunished. What do you think of_ that, _you--_ Daniel's words register, most particularly his final question, derailing his train of thought. "'We'? NightStar." He shakes his head in self-annoyance. "Sasha," he corrects. "You must know Sasha. Without her, I'd be..." His voice trails off. The idea of a Daniel--_Me, not this other._\--without a Sasha is incomprehensible, a gap too wide for mere neurons to spark across it. He looks between the others, vague horror pulling at his features.

"This situation isn't black and white," Ambiance returns. But he can't help the rueful grin at the symbology of the words. Though at the mention of Sasha, the light manipulator can only frown.

DarkGlow looks to Daniel, eyes wide.

"Sasha?" Daniel leans back in his chair in consideration. "Sasha... That was my first girl friend. The first person who ever gave me the indication I wasn't worthless." That sentence is nearly muttered under his breath as arms cross. He lets loose a sigh and looks up, back at DarkGlow, staring at those wide eyes.

DarkGlow's brows draw down. "But...?" he prompts.

"... but she kept pushing. She kept pushing and pushing and finally decided that I wasn't going anymore. That I wasn't going to go much further." His face is tight. "I wasn't up to her raising standards."

DarkGlow nods. "Yeah. Something like that," he tells the other, murmuring to himself afterward, "'Girlfriend'?" _Well, I suppose, technically. But it's a damn strange way of putting it._ He looks over to Ambiance, head cocked. "No one like that?"

"The first time I delt with crime beyond normal people, it was a woman. The next three years were a savage little war between the two of us." There's a hard, almost predatory look on his face, a look in those eyes like some part of him liked it, but it would never be said aloud. "The last I saw her, she was fleeing across the rooftops while I was trying to get out from beneath some debris. Her name is Sasha."

DarkGlow's smile holds echoes of fear and sorrow inseperably mixed. "My future," he says to Ambiance. "I guess we none of us are strong enough to hold onto her, to change _her_ instead of being changed ourselves. Best we can do is try to escape before we are subsumed." His hand comes up to dash tears from his eyes. "Damn spice," he mutters, despite the fact that his mouth has been empty for minutes now. He starts to take a drink from his bottle of water, but pauses when he finds himself mentally saluting his former... _Friend? Girlfriend? Partner..?_ He raises the bottle a fraction. "To other selves," he says, almost daring the others to join him, no matter what they may think of his phrasing.

"To ourselves," Says Ambiance, raising his water.

Daniel raises his coke. "To ..." He pauses. "Other selves."

DarkGlow looks down at his plate, pretends to decide what he wants to eat next. _I saw the fire in your eye, Amibance. You'll meet her again, and then you'll know what Daniel and I know. And with all your light, I think you'll still feel the regret. You give me no comfort. And Daniel--you, the normal one, or so you'd have us believe. I wonder if things are truly done between you and your Sasha, either. I'd offer you comfort, but I don't know how, and don't think you'd accept it anyway. So, just good luck to you, then. Good luck to us all._ He gives up the pretense, and sets down his chopsticks. _I'm here, Sasha! If it wasn't you in the mall, then I'm still waiting for you! There are too many mysteries, and I would have done!_ He looks up, grins crookedly. "So, enough about me. What are your favourite books? Play computer games at all? Let's get to the _important_ stuff!"

---

The bowels of a warehouse, where light is thick, dirty beams that lance through the gloom. Varying shades, machines creating new objects in the moving, churning gloom. She steps through the dark arch into the gloom, and seems at home in the little light that makes the shades. It simply melts away behind her as though it had never been.

Arms folded, mouth set, DarkGlow challenges her. "Well? Who are you?"

"I'm you." She frowns, "You know what I mean. That machine, the others. Nightstar exists in this world, doesn't he?" After a moment, "Or would it be she?"

DarkGlow smirks. "_You_ are DarkGlow, in your world. Heh--it makes a certain colloquial expression rather more possible. Same name, and same looks, but different gender." The semi-smile vanishes abruptly. "And maybe different roles in the relationship, too. Who's to say--and be believed...?"

"Yes, yes, go ahead and be philosophical. We have all the time." Her eyes narrow. "We have a candle wick's life here. Nightstar hasn't tried to take your strenght, correct?"

His eyes narrow back. "Since I've no idea what you're talking about, I guess that would be a 'no'."

A short, irritated sigh hisses from her. "Very well. There's something in you, on you... it's guarding you. It wants me out. It might protect you from her. Whatever the case, one of you can vanquish the other, and strip the other of their abilities." A dark smile creeps across her lips. "I won. I can now look into the shadows of the soul. The heart. The mind. Whatever you want to call it; I can not be seen simply because I say they can't see me, and they don't. Except those like your friend, the one who was shielded."

"Telepaths." He spits the word, but then just shrugs off the feeling as unimportant here and now. "How?" he asks, simply.

"Shadows are more then just... the absence of light. The blocking of it. Think about it; they are the impressions left by things. A glimpse, an outline and sillouette. Everything has those, even the mind. And one can simply be cast over the eyes to not see something." A pause. "Or do you mean, how can she take your powers."

"The latter. Perhaps I _do_ philosophise too much." His sarcasm is more than a little biting.

A hesitation - and a wry smirk. "I don't know how to... explain it. I killed my Nightstar. I stabbed him, and drew out what was his into mine. I knew what he knew, I found what I could do greater, more powerful. It felt like a part of me had returned."

"You stabbed...? But she's..." He looks down at his hand, gloved now in leather, not shadow. Not yet. "I suppose-- Maybe... if it came down to that..." He regards his other, anger dispelled by confusion and uncertainty. "Forgive me, but you seem... The others who are also us, their Sashas, their NightStars all seemed more--" _Evil is a stupid word._ "--more malevolent than them. You seem to me to be the same way. You absorbed her--his--power. 'What was his into mine,' you said. _What else did you draw?_"

There is silence. Much on her face is raw and readable. Pain, fear, anger, love, loss. "NightStar was no different." The words are more quiet. "You could say that along with the psychological gauding and abuse, he sometimes got physical when I could counter his arguements." For the first time she seems almost uneasy. "She isn't here, nearby, I take it. You're apart from her. I wasn't apart from mine. I never left his side - so to speak. Always pushing, pressing me to go further. I never let go, I kept struggling, pushing myself. Then I finally let go, by severing the link. By severing him."

Her frown is dark. "Some things came along with the power." The gloom wraps around her like a blanket, as if hiding from the man's eyes. "There was a coldness in my body when I struck. It had came over the both of us. A desire to end it. It was an ugly, long thing, and he made a mistake." Her voice isn't pleased or prideful - or mournful either. Simply tired. "I find the urge to use what is mine more often. Flaunt it. Do what I will with it." Those words are said as though she's almost afraid of that. "I-"

Quietly, he gives her his half of the story. "Physical wasn't an issue," he says, softly. "Was never an issue. I couldn't dream of beating her up--" _Still can't, truth be told...._ "--and her tongue was far more effective than any mere fist could be. Leaving was..." He shrugs, helpless to find the words, but then realizes that this other DarkGlow could do nothing but already understand. "I've been... I never admit this to myself but, I've been running, hiding from her, even as I told myself I was just living my life." He looks at her, at what he might become. _But the power to escape her forever and just be myself. That would be--_

A chill like a blizzard's rake claws up DarkGlow's back. He can feel the shadows squeezing his duplicate, while they pull at him, tell him of all the shadows around for him to dive in. Rage, fear, confusion, a desire for blood. She's poisoning him with her words, with her thoughts. Stop her. She wants his power. A scream as the darkness pulls away from her, the inky black at the edge of the basement's light radiating from her. "_Control_ it! Control yourself!"

He shudders, suppressing everything in hopes of suppressing it, too. _Who's the poison?_ he wonders, the words the faintest of whispers even inside his head. Grimly he takes hold of the shadows, pulling them away from her. It's odd, though. It's too hard, like he can't use his full strength. Like he was pulling against himself, and going nowhere. He almost loses control in the shock of realization, before anger re-ignites in his mind. _Mine! They're_ mine_, not yours! **Give them back to me!**_ He finds himself on one knee, gasping for breath, an iron taste in his mouth where he's bitten his tongue. Shadows shimmer around him, but no longer move. He slowly stands, cocks an eye at her. "Something really doesn't like you," he tells her. "And it's more than just my phantom friend, assuming it's him riding me again. Then again, I don't much like myself either, so I think we're even."

"Phantom?" She chokes, shaking her head. "Is that what it is? Some kind of ghost? It could be." She sags just a little, before standing up fully. "It's guarding you from me; it's all I can do to fight it too. It doesn't like me." The shadows whip and curl around her like snakes. "You don't have to kill Nightstar. But reaize she might want to kill you. Protect yourself, be wary."

He looks at her. "Looking at you, I don't know if I should. You remind me of NightStar. I think you're following the steps that she walked, that he walked. I don't know if there's hope for you. I don't know if there's hope for me. You says you have the urge to use what you now possess. Just remember that, as I told another one of us, that every shadow requires light. Don't forget the light; pure blackness will kill us as surely as a dozen suns. I walked away from my NightStar's path, you broke yourself away from yours. Will you fall back now? Would I fall back? I don't know..." He feels nausous. He realizes that he cannot control the shadows, not completely. _What can I say to her?_ Images flash before him. Ghost Knight. Laughing Guy. Tia in her newness and innocence. Even the telepath, Ming. "Find friends. _Friends._ Help them. Try to balance the darkness." The blood taste is strong in his mouth. "Go," he tells her. "I can't hold--"

Her face draws up in pain and fear and something that can't be defined. Staring into the face of her duplicate, she can only nod, and find no words. The shadows open behind her as she starts to sink inside. "Watch yourself. Don't let yourself fall into the trap that I am. You're no white knight, but you're not Death." With that, she steps into the darkness.

He streches a useless hand out ot her. "Neither are you," he calls. "Be _grey_!" But the shadows have closed over her. _Grey.... Oh, my other self. What will we do...?_ His strength fails and gravity clubs him down, but darkness claims him before he can feel the pain. Even so, the last thought that flickers is the the certain knowledge that the darkness would not be forever, and he would still have to face the future, willing or no.
