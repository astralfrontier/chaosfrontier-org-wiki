Thomas Temple is a sure planner. Although not the wisest man in the world, he is at least intelligent enough to predict the future when the contributing factors are known. A coincidental appearance of the team would be too .. coincidental. But is it improbable that the team would keep track of Arlene's own activities? Not at all. With that in mind, the reporter's office is called, and an appointment is scheduled for an interview. Tape recording is just fine, if necessary.

Lane's Bowling Alley is a normally not the best place to hold an interview, with the leagues going, or just standard customers, the noise of the game, not to mention the televisions showing other sports events often leaves conversation limited. But at three in the afternoon on a Tuesday, there simply isn't that much business. Guy reclines in a booth by the snackbar, poking curiously at his nachos which he ordered on a lark. Beside the booth steps Arlene, looking sharp as always. An out-thrust hand. "Mr. Neville."

"A pleasure ta meetcha Ms. Raymond. Have a seat." Guy gestures towards one of the booths across the way. "Mind the nachos. I don't think they're alive... but you never know." He smiles a winning smile, "So, what exactly is it you wanna know?"

The reporter drops a manilla envelope on the table, and begins opening it as she sits down. From inside she removes shots of a surveillance camera from inside the Mall. Another includes a picture or two taken the day that Guy delt with the NPG in the downtown MCPD. Pushing the pictures to him, "Would you say these are you?"

The detective picks up the pictues, raises an eyebrow. He peers at them. Brings them close to his nose, then pulls them away. "Well hmmm. You know, I can't say they really look exactly like me, though there is a certain resemblance. But there're lots of good looking guys out there y'know."

"That's funny. Because I remember you working with Ghost Knight and his "team" when you were at the campus's stadium, a few weeks ago. And before that, babysitting I and Catherine Green from the mafia." Arlene raises a brow. "I'm pretty sure the resemblance was uncanny then."

**The resemblance is uncanny,** booms a voice. From behind Arlene a black-clad figure with a skeletal head steps out, standing beside the booth. With him is a woman in costume, and a third - someone who looks just like Guy Neville. "Hiya," this man says, smiling, and waves a greeting.

Arlene turns slowly, and this time a pad of paper is in hand, her eyes shrewdly considering the other two. "I know you," She says, pointing the pen simply at the Ghost Knight. "Who are your partners."

Guy blinks at the sight of the second him. "Well... you handsome devil you." _Heh. I haven't had this much fun since... yesterday. Hmm. I look good._

The third man smiles. "Me? I'm just a Guy, so to speak." The Ghost's voice continues. **He is the man witnessed, an associate of ours. That he should look like Mr. Neville would be no surprise to anyone who knew what we were doing.** 'Which would not be you' is left unsaid.

Ignoring the slight, she glances at the woman in blue. "I have only one report mentioning you; I havn't gotten a name yet." Her attention shifts to the Ghost Knight. "There's one missing, then."

**Maybe when you interview us, you can meet him. Until then, I felt it was necessary that you be informed as to Mr. Neville's true status.** The Ghost is utterly motionless, the third man takes over speaking. "I'd like that, y'know. I could give a short demonstration."

"Yeah. I'd like to see that demonstration myself. If I'm gonna be accused of stuff, I'd like to know what I've got goin' for me besides my cunning wit and roguish good looks." says Guy. One of the Guys. Grinning to match the facial expression on the other one.

"Since you've displayed your powers on security cameras, then I'm sure you wouldn't oppose to give a demonstration on camera." Arlene offers this while staring down at the second Guy.

**I would oppose it,** cuts in the Ghost's cold, dead voice. **Your reputation precedes you, Ms. Raymond. You oppose superhumans acting on their own recognizance, using their abilities as they see fit, and yet you have no qualms about taking advantage of their gifts for the furtherance of your own career.**

"I'm a journalist first and foremost," She replies without looking at the Ghost Knight. "I like reporting the truth, if nothing else. If I have my own camera, I know that I can avoid some tricks my eyes can't see, and some technology can't lie to me."

The Ghost shrugs. **As you wish. If you like, you can discuss it sometime...** The third man withdraws a card from his pocket and lays it on the table; all that's there is a phone number, a date and a time. "Sorry, Guy," he grins. "We'll stop hoggin' the spotlight now." And with that the trio begins to withdraw.

Arlene accepts the card without a word, sliding it into the manilla folder with the pictures of Guy. "I'll be there." Turning back to the detective, she slides out of the booth. "Sorry to have inconvenienced your time, Mr. Neville. May I keep you on file in case I need some assistance with a story?"

"Sure thing Ms. Raymond. It's not like I don't know what happens to file." Guy grins, "But uh, feel free. You've got my number." With that he takes one last prod at the nachos, thinks better of it, and says, "I suppose this is goodbye then." He too slides out of the booth and files out of the bowling alley.

---

It's a late night, and having made sure her sister is safe and sound, Ming decides to go see who is around the base. She's been oddly silent, not responding to any attempts to communicate with her since she learned that one of her team mates decided to invade her privacy and violate her trust. At the very least, she ought to talk to someone and let them know what's on her mind.

DarkGlow stalks the half-finished halls of the teams new secret lair, ostensibly memorizing the shadow0-filled nooks and crannies but more stalking something nameless. His long strides eat away at the distance between the halls' beginnings and endings and, while less confined than at his apartment, he still feels trapped. Outside, however, he knows that in his state of mind he'll just get into trouble--the messy and bloody kind.

Ming will naturally wind up in her lab, where she sits and sighs. She stares at a computer monitor for a while, her picture reflected dully on the glass of it. She frowns at the reflection and shakes her head. "What am I doing here?" she mutters softly.

He pretends the nameless thing is before him, and his sends a spear of shadow lancing at it. Bleeding darkness, it keels over and 'dies'. Elsewhere, a noise barely registers on his consciousness. All he thinks is that there's another nameless thing to stalk in these empty corridors; anything to take his mind of the endless seconds of living. _I need sleep. But what would I dream this time? Where would I a-wander tonight?_ He turns a sharp corridor, shadows ready to be flung. Where will the nameless thing appear?

Ming eventually gets up and wanders out into the hall, making her way towards the kitchen. Feeling something a bit strange, she banishes herself from sight and hearing and waits to see just what the threat might be. Clearly even this place isn't safe.

DarkGlow makes a half-hearted attempt to step stealthily into the kitchen, but nothing awaits him there. His imagination apparently is too tired to again come out and play. The darkness he had gathered in anticipation dissipates and, with an audible sigh, he pulls open the fridge and stares into its lightless interior. "A grocery run would kill time," he mutters to himself. "Maybe a bag of ice. What's open this late 'round here?"

Dropping her illusion, Ming sighs. "There's an all-night store a few blocks away," she says calmly. "Or you can just break into my apartment again and make yourself a sandwich."

DarkGlow whirls in a tight spin, but the shadows sucked from the immediate environment fly to shield him and rip open a portal from where he stands to elsewhere, rather than arrowing at the sudden intruder. Realizing who has managed to sneak up on him, he's almost sorry his instincts hadn't been more... direct in nature. He undoes his half-step through the non-real portal of shadow, and relaxes his powers once more. With an almost physical wrench, he twists his thoughts into something appropriate to the situation. His tone is flat as he manages to say, "Your sister offered me a sandwich as well. I'm afraid I shall have to again decline."

"I suppose she did, she's a very polite, innocent girl," says Ming softly. She frowns thoughtfully, "Why did you decide that you should break into my house? Were you trying to intimidate me? If you want me to leave this team, you could have just asked. It's not like I don't have other things to do."

"Leave?" DarkGlow blinks, confused. "I should think I'm more likely to leave than you. I'm the one who's been in the thick of every battle this team has had and yet apparently still doesn't have sufficient enthusiasm for 'teamwork'." Bitterness is evident in his tone and weariness in his posture; he slumps back against the reclosed fridge's door. _Why don't you tell her what you really feel?_

"Why did you come to my home?" asks Ming again. "That has nothing to do with battle. You seem so eager to avoid mental contact for fear of losing privacy, yet you break into my house. You could have at least asked to speak with my sister."

DarkGlow throws back his hood and rubs at his eyes. They're bloodshot and that, combined with the pink irises, might normally make for a gaze that is unsettling bordering on frightening, but now, as he blinks myopically to clear the film across his vision that the rubbing caused, it just makes him look sad. "There was no breaking involved. I knocked and your sister answered. We had a nice chat, I gave her a bit of a flight around the room and then I left. Somehow I didn't think asking your permission to quiz your sister on what she really thought of you would go over too well." He pauses, considers. "Actually, that's not true--I didn't think of asking you anything at all. I didn't care what you thought, but I did believe that maybe your sister might change that." _There--what I really feel. Happy?_

"And now what?" asks Ming softly. "Now that you are thinking of me, what do you feel. Did you do what was right? Do you really believe that it was okay to open the door and come in on your own? Knock indeed." The telepath shakes her head, "Why are you so curious about me, now? Why do you want to know what my sister thinks and feels?"

"Ah, that is the question, isn't it? Why am I curious about Professor 'I have no secrets.'? Why am I curious about what you really have to hide? Can't you guess? Can't you _tell_?"

"No, I can't," answers Ming. "Unless your whole goal was to prove that my openess was a mistake. Is that your point? That I should hide from you, because you might take away the ones I love?"

DarkGlow laughs, harshly. "'Take away'? Who's been calling who paranoid?"

"I have reason to be wary of you. You've hidden yourself away. Why? Who are you, under those shadows?" Ming asks. "Do you just want to piss me off? Is that it? I don't understand you in the least. I have tried to be open, I've wanted to have a point in this team, you haven't wanted anything to do with me, and out of the blue you break into my house and talk to my sister. How can I see that but as a threat?"

"A touch, a touch! In truth, a touch!" DarkGlow gives her a half-bow, as courtly a one as Hollywood had shown. "How could you not? 'Pissing you off', dear lady, requires no such theatrics. It requires nothing more, as far as I can tell, than a refusal to submit to your mind tricks." He sighs, dropping the act. "She said you might fancy me, being a superhero and all. How ironic is that? She half-accused me of visiting because I like you, too--even more ironic. She even laughed as I denied it. How like an ogre I must has been to her. Twirling her about the room while she giggled--how like a monster, no? I was so horrible that she even tried to shanghai me into taking her to the mall." This act, too, he drops. "She has nothing to fear from me," he whispers finally.

"I'm going, you don't want to talk to me. This is pointless and uncomfortable." Ming turns away and starts to head out. This is a waste of time, anyway. There are other things for her to do. Like decide if she's ever going to come back.

_If you let her go, you're a fool._ He straightens, stares after her. _The answers are in my head, according to Eerie._ "Wait. Please." _Why did I go to her sister?_ "I'm sorry." _Because-- Oh, shut up, already. Just tell her._ "I saw your sister to see what someone close to you really thought of you. She's a good kid. She loves you. That's not quite as good as trust, I guess, but it tells me you're a good person. An actual good person. And maybe then I could trust you." He's still speaking at her back. "Will you wait? Please?"

Ming stops and looks down at her feet. "I will wait," she says softly. She turns part of the way, but doesn't meet DarkGlow's eyes. "I don't understand you. I don't know what you want from me. I thought you hated me." She considers for a moment and says more quietly, "I'd like it if we could trust each other."

DarkGlow hasn't the energy left to goggle. _She actually stopped. I guess this the way the world ends, then._ H e risks a bit more truth: "Trust is earned. I don't know you; I don't really trust you. And you shouldn't trust me either--you don't know me near enough to decide for yourself. But come then--I surrender. Peek into my head and see what you would see." _See if you can see the answer that after all my meditation I am blind to._ He smiles, a ghost of humour in the expression. "And if I should faint again, just kick me into the corner, out of the way."

Ming makes her way over to DarkGlow. "Are you sure you want me poking around in there?" she asks softly. She admits quietly, "I'm afraid." She isn't very comfortable with the thought of pushing into somebody's head. Even with permission, something of it seems frightening.

DarkGlow shrugs, and takes another step towards his doom. _Are you laughing somewhere, phantom? **Someone** should be cackling madly at all this..._ "No more, I'm sure, than you'd like me to lift you into the sky on wings of shadow." _I do what I must, and I choose this death, if death it is._ He smiles, a shockingly gentle expression. "But how else can you really trust me?" _Atonement. Good works. Balancing karma. Probably won't be boring, anyway, with this bunch around. Wonder if I can get NightStar to sign on? Wouldn't that be..._ He mentally sighs. _Impossible._ "And then maybe you'll feel what shadow wings are like. Not even I know that, actually. I think I'd be jealous..."

"Just relax," says Ming. She actually laughs a bit. Sure. Relax. Her hands are trembling as they fidget. Finally, she says, "I'm starting." More carefully than she ever has, she reaches out with her telepathy, pressing carefully against and then past the border that marks the beginning of DarkGlow's mind.

There is a noise at the back of DarkGlow's throat which he feels more than hears. _This is the way the world ends... not with a bang, but a whimper._

No resistance meets her probing now. Unfolding DarkGlow's mind a pandora's box, once opened something rises to her mind's eye. Ming is there beside Daniel, watching through the bushes as a blindfolded man is shot in the back of the head. He falls to his knees, the blindfold coming off. She feels Daniel's mind hit like a hammer as the man makes eye-contact with him. A third conciousness joins the boy's mind, sinking deep into lower places, far beneath into recesses below conciousness. Ming feels the same experience just yards away. Another mind, a girl, young, standing behind a tree.

Another mind, down the spiderweb of conciousness. She feels the other person, and then so does DarkGlow. As one Sasha and he feel eachother, hear one another's thoughts. That acknowledgement summons something from the depths of DarkGlow's mind, something harsh and buried that breaches the surface like a shark. Death, pain, anger, _fear_, it broadcasts through the mentalist and its' host, driving them to their knees.

Ming lets out a soft gasp and tears slide down her to her chin. "Hurts," she whispers. Or she tries to. She's not even sure what is happening. "Something else is there.. so much pain."

"Sasha..." he whispers, then, because she always hated that name, immediately corrects, "NightStar. I should like to have seen you again before the end..."

Darkglow can tell where Nightstar is. Close. "I..." For a moment, the two experience a sense of malevolence, a raw psyche clawing over them, darkness nearly enveloping the room as light twists and writhing. Ming feels the sensation rebuffed, and in that moment, DarkGlow senses down the cable that his lost half is going through the same trauma, before the link to Sasha is shattered, leaving the two alone in the room.

Ming shivers and shakes her head, "Who are you?" she whispers. And then there is silence. Or rather near silence compared to what was there. "What.. who was that? Who is Nightstar?" She tries to remember where she heard that name, but cannot. Was it real?

Ming's words wash over DarkGlow--he pays them no heed. His eyes are open again and he can barely make sense of what he sees. A kitchen he's in; he knows this. And a woman is before him. He knows this too. But the scene, the shapes--they are ugly, flat. The pockets of shadow around him are nothing but pools of darkness; they do not twist under his gaze, he cannot feel them in his mind. He strains, frantic to reach them, but but nothing happens. "Eerie said, too, that I'd lose my shadow." His voice is sick; he wants nothing but to collapse and keen in horror and sorrow. "It's all gone..."

"The world is truly ended..." he finishes, voice barely audible.

"What happened?" asks Ming softly. "What is going on?" She crawls over to DarkGlow, having failed to get to her feet. "Lost your shadow?" she whispers softly. "Why?"

"I don't know," DarkGlow replies. He looks around, staring at everything and seeing nothing. "Or maybe I do and I just don't know it. I was hoping you could tell me, but now...?"

"There were other minds linked to yours," Ming says softly. "There were two more. One felt.. horrible." She sighs and shivers, "Are you hurt?"

He touches his eyes, ears. "I'm not bleeding. I guess I'm all right."

Ming nods, pushing herself up to her feet with some difficult. She offers her hands to DarkGlow. "Do you think you can stand up?" she asks softly.

He accepts her hand but puts as little weight as possible on it as he gets his legs under him. His legs are steady. "Looks like it." It's strange that his body should feel fine when the rest of the world feels so wrong.

Ming is surprised that DarkGlow can rise so easily. Her knees barely work, and her mind feels like it has been pulled out of the fire. "We should probably have just stayed down," she says, putting a hand to her head. "I don't understand.. who were those people in your mind?"

DarkGlow speaks quietly. "Sasha is NightStar, my other self. We grew up together. My powers are hers, and hers mine. Or were, anyway. She is the other half of my soul that I cut away when I realized she was killing me by inches--not that this new life seems likely to last longer." He pauses. "The other I don't know. Maybe it's the phantom that's been haunting me."

"Are we in danger?" Ming asks quietly. "Maybe we should call the others for help." She doesn't show any signs of moving, though. At least not yet. The concept of staying on her feet is radical enough at this point.

"Leaving might be good," DarkGlow admits. "But I don't feel like running. Que sera, sera. And it's funny--I'll go lend skullface a hand with but the slightest prompting, but somehow I really don't want his help right now. And I don't think I could bear any of Guy's jokes, well meaning or no."

"Well, if you want, you can stay at my place," says Ming. She bites her lip, "If you don't mind having a young girl grin at us and think she knows what's really going on, anyway." She looks around dimly, "I think I can walk now, at least." She takes a step. "Yeah, I can. I should be able to call a cab here. If I promise a big enough tip they'll even hurry."

"A cab? I don't think I've ever ridden in one of those before." He chuckles, softly, nervously, like a man laughing at the wittism he'd just confided to his executioner. "Why not? I can't even get into my place like this..."

"Let's go then," says Ming softly. "I'll just make a quick call, and we'll get out of here. Besides, I feel a bit weird being here late at night. It's so quiet."

DarkGlow shrugs. "Part of the attraction, I'd always thought." He looks around, eyes slowly adjusting to his new reality. "I'll go get my pack, change in to my civvies. I guess wearing this get-up now is a bit... pretentious." He takes a few steps, then says over his shoulder, "They're the clothes I wore when I saw your sister. Maybe you'll even get an idea what she saw in me." Laughing, he vanishes in a mundane sort of way into the hallway.
