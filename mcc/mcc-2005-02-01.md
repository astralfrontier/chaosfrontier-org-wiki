The temple is a high, aloof dot on a mist-covered mountainside when seen from a distance. The little country of Tibet has always been a place of peace and serenity, but serenity has always had a reason: the search for peace only begins when you are in conflict. For Tibet, that conflict has been with China.

Many men have come to places like the temple in the past. Some came for understanding. Others came to take away the teachers that helped these seekers attain it. Today, men with automatic weapons and full-coverage charcoal-black body armor gather at the base of the mountain. And today, in the temple itself, two men sit. One's head is shaved, and he wears the traditionally simple garb of a priest. The other man is a Westerner, admitted here for the sole reason that the priest he sits with considers his exceptional gifts a sign of spiritual advancement.

Thomas Temple sits in meditation with his teacher, quietly focusing on the world around him and meditating with a stillness he has learned since coming here. He is learning to calm his anger.

From the far wall of the temple - where the entrance is - the sound of footsteps can be heard. One set belongs to a very surprised traveler, while the other is that of her guide, Exodus. ".. built this place a long time ago," he is saying, as though he were a Hollywood Tour-Bus driver. "It's really pretty this time of year." Seeing the two men, the teleporter raises a hand. "Yo! Padre! Yo! Outsider dude!"

Megan is paying a great deal of attention to her guide. Perhaps more than she really should, considering the way he can make even the most mystic of places sound a bit more shallow than they ought to. She is a bit shaky at the moment, still not used to Exodus' particular brand of tourism. She contents herself to focus on the men he calls out to. They have got to be a bit more calming.. don't they?

The priest says something quietly in a foreign language - one Exodus seems blithely able to ignore, but which the temple visitor understands. He rises, turning - dressed, it turns out, in a simple sweatpants-and-shirt outfit - and stares at the two. "He says, 'who are you?'"

Megan's eyes widen. "Umm, I'm Megan. But most people know me as Star Chyld." She looks around, wondering if her music has ever been heard within a thousand miles of this place. "I don't suppose you want an autograph?" she asks sheepishly. In the back of her mind, she wants to kick Exodus somewhere.

Exodus laughs. "And I'm her agent, how ya doin." In a moment he's wearing a pair of cheap sunglasses, and extending a business card with one hand. Nobody really saw him put on the one or withdraw the other, but he can be like that. The other man continues to stare, turning only to speak with his teacher after a moment in brief conversation. "He asks you to wait outside."

Megan frowns at Exodus, "You are not really my agent," she mutters, rather annoyed. "You don't know the first thing about my professional needs." She shrugs it off, turning to Thomas and bowing politely. "I'm sorry about this, sir. He's.." She shakes her head, unable to find the right word for Exodus.

"'Annoying?'" prompts the Western kid helpfully. "Yeah, I know that guy. Teleporter, right?" Exodus blushes, rubbing the back of his head in mock-embarrassment at recognition. "You guys are..." He focuses a moment, eyes locked on nothing at all, then mumbles something at the priest and then at his visitors: "it's about to become dangerous here. Please leave right away."

"That's the word," says Megan. She looks at the westerner with a bit of worry. "Dangerous? Is there anything we could do to help?" Her instincts are pretty clear, at least. "I know we met like 25 seconds ago, but you seem kinda nice. If I can help you get out of some trouble, I will."

"Are you immune to bullets?" the kid asks calmly.

Megan shakes her head, "No, I'm not," she murmurs softly. "But I.. I have this friend who is not really troubled by them," she explains. "She's really very strong. One of those hero types, if you know what I mean."

"Unless she's here, that's no use," says the kid, who begins walking across the floor and heading up the steps toward the temple door, where the pair await. "Armor engage," he announces to no one. What looked like a simple outfit begins to unfold like liquid origami, meshing around him and covering his face and body in a black armor. The head - a white skull, fleshless and eerie. A long coat snaps into existence, billowing out of the back half of the suit. **You, teleporter,** the Ghost Knight orders. **Keep them safe.**

Megan looks to Exodus, frowning in thought. "I can get her here," she says softly. "But I need to have some time umm.. alone. It's a secret how she shows up. I'll just find a place to hide until it's safe, okay? I can't reveal my body guard's secret, you know?"

**There are areas of the temple you can find,** the Ghost says simply, heading for the door. **Be careful.**

Megan nods quickly and rushes away, finding some room out of the way. She bites her lip, never really all that comfortable with this. Still, Taurus is her friend, and it's her turn. There's a feeling of strange weakness, and then Megan is floating in the sea of her mind, seeing the zodiac about her. For a sliver of time, for what seems three days, they are all there, focusing in thought. Only together can this be done. With a sudden rushing sense of excitement the form of Megan is replaced by that of Taurus, the bull snorting and shaking the cobwebs from her head. She's a methodical one, testing her limbs before she rises, going back to join the others. By the time she is back near Exodus, she's fully acclimated with having a body again.

"So... that 'friend of mine' thing was a lot of bull, huh?" asks Exodus with that easy-going, sometimes-infuriating grin on his face. He's standing near the priest by this time, and he's got - of all things - a game of Solitaire laid out on the stone floor of the temple.

Taurus arches an eyebrow, "You are used to moving quickly, right? If you'd like, I could accomodate that with my foot." She laughs softly, bending down to look at the Salitaire game. She immediately says, "You have a move there. Put the eight on the nine, and move that king of clubs to the open space. Oh, and what got the kid so nervous, anyway? You aren't taking very good care of her. If you get her hurt, we might just let Scorpio flirt with you."

Exodus only points outside with one hand, his attention mostly resting on the card game. "Hey, uh.. outside?" he prompts. As if in answer, the sound of automatic weapons fire can be heard coming from down the hill.

The bull frowns, "Guns. Always gun. Little humans and their guns, trying to hurt other little humans." She strides outside, wondering if she will have to show them just how very little they are. The bull is not steahlthy, but she keeps low. At least for the moment. She'll leave cover in a very big way soon enough.

The temple can only be reached by a narrow mountain road that winds and twists its way up the side of the hill. Thousands of feet over the edge of it is the valley below; a fall is not a pleasant thing to consider. And midway down the road is a sight: almost two dozen men in dark armor, all armed, are engaging the Ghost Knight. Or trying to.

As soon as Taurus is clear of the temple, she begins to make use of her temper. Each step forward causes her to grow, and grow, ever larger, until she absolutely dwarfs everyone about her, and still she's growing larger yet, only stopping when she's over forty feet tall, each heavy step sending very noticable vibrations through the earth.

Down the hill, the soldiers are staying in admirable formation. The Ghost's delaying and distracting tactics aren't interfering with their coordination, and they seem to be passing orders to each other in a disciplined fashion. Nevertheless, they lack the gifts that he uses so prodigiously and almost so casually. While he's decking one man, another will run up behind him, only to slam hard into a wall of solid rock the Ghost raises behind him. As the man runs around the rock monolith, the Ghost ducks back into it, then leaps out to catch the man in a surprise neck-throw. Here and there, damaged weapons lay on the ground.

Taurus frowns down at all the little people fighting. It seems they aren't even noticing her yet. She could just kick them at unawares, but that is simply not right. She's bigger than they are, and they aren't even paying attention to her yet. Not that she really blames them. They are having a hard enough time as it is. Still, she's not just going to stand around, no matter how clean the air is here. Her voice booms down, "Hey!" and stomps a foot down harder than ever, her hooves leaving a sizable crater in the road.

Many of the soldiers turn, appraising this new threat. Many raise their weapons, happy for a chance to target something easier to hit. **You must not kill them!** calls the Ghost, loudly and peremtorily, in the middle of elbowing one soldier in the solar plexus.

Taurus nods. She can hit without killing. She will just kick a bit less roughly than she could. "If I mess up I'll just get my sister to put them back together," she explains loudly. Her kick sends the men scrambling about, sending one flying. The men are not stupid, trying to spread out as much as possible. They fire and hit, but the body of Taurus is strongly armored, letting only the least bit of damage break through.

For his part, the Ghost seems to be wielding some black blade as his weapon of choice. Where it goes, it resistlessly cuts - weapons fall into halves, great gashes open in armor, the red sensor-studded goggles of the soldiers' helmets break open in a glory of sparks.

Taurus decides to do things more simply. She has some very good footwork, it seems, and is forcing five men into an ever tightening area. With a quick grab she plucks on of them up. When he raises his gun, she plucks it away with two fingers, then flicks it down at another with her full strength, striking the man's helmeted head square and sending him sprawling.

After a certain point, any good soldier knows when to give up. And any good commander knows when to call his men back. The Chinese have had a long history of belief in reincarnation; whether it's true or not, no one here seems interested in finding a new life just yet. In an ordered retreat, the soldiers - those who can move - make their way down the hill, helping their unconscious comrades. Their weapons are abandoned for now. The battle has been won.

Taurus shakes her head, letting out a thunderous sigh. She plucks at what wounds she has, but they slowly seal themselves, powered by her incredible vitality. Seeing the foes leave, she shrinks swiftly, resuming a much more normal size. "Were you hurt?" she asks softly.

The face behind the mask is invisible. The eyes cannot be seen. The look that the Ghost gives to this question, however, is unmistakeable: _are you kidding me?_

Taurus laughs a bit, stretching where she stands. "Well, that mess is done. Umm.. no offense, but where the heck am I? Megan didn't really bring that up." Not that she'd really have to, normally.

**You are in Tibet, in a place called Kuk La Shu by some,** says the man in black. **This place is normally forbidden to outsiders. But the priest will want to thank you, I think. Come.**

Back up the hill the pair trudge, and the black armor and fleshless head the man wears transform themselves via the same magic into a set of simple apprentice's robes. Perhaps a conceit on the part of the man wearing them, in the face of his guests. Inside, Exodus is quietly trying to urge the priest into a game of Texas Hold' Em. The language and cultural barrier doesn't seem to be stopping the young teleporter, though.

"I hope he doesn't go to any trouble," says Taurus. "It wasn't a big deal. I don't like people with guns attacking others, I guess. It's so dishonorable." She wrinkles her nose, snorting loudly, "Makes me mad."

The kid approaches his mentor, explaining quietly the situation, and gestures at Taurus, then at Exodus. This seems to satisfy the old man, and he waves at the super to approach. "He says you are also spiritually advanced, and therefore welcome here. And that I'm to see to your needs, in thanks for helping protect the temple."

"I don't really have any needs," says Taurus. She bows politely, "And it was an honor to help you, though I don't really understand why they are bothering you." She plucks at one of her horns, looking toughtful. "I'm not that aware of this corner of the world.."

"My name is Thomas," explains the apprentice, and gestures around at the temple. "This place.. it has a history with my people, those of my bloodline. Many people with powers have history that rests here. Those men were Chinese, and their government fears that this place could somehow produce other people with powers to combat them."

"I'm Taurus, of the Zodiac," says the bull softly. She looks around slowly, not really sure what to make of the story. "It's an honor to be in their presence," she decides aloud. "Humans greatly fear powerful things that they can't immediately understand and control, it seems."

"Wouldn't you?" asks Tom, softly. "If you met something that made a mockery of your power, how would you respond?"

"I have never really envied anyone anything," answers Taurus. "Some are smarter than me, some far more powerful. Like you seem to be. I do not feel offended, though. I guess I can't understand them." The bull shrugs, "I guess I can't feel like they do. I'm so different than they are."

Thomas gestures around the temple. "Yes. That is the sort of thing people come here to learn," he adds. Carefully he gestures, and Exodus' cards leave the ground and slip into Tom's outstretched hand. The teleporter narrows his eyes, trying desperately for a menacing look and failing completely. "We don't come here to learn cards," says Tom sharply.

"That one just seems to caues difficulty," says Taurus. She looks to the cards curiously. "You come here to learn?" she asks. "If there's something here to learn, I should probably pass it on to one of my friends on the team. The Gemini are very eager to learn everything that can be learned. I just don't have it in me, most days."

The old priest chuckles and speaks, and Tom listens for a moment before passing it on. "He says you are very stubborn and foolish and you should be sitting down for tea by now instead of arguing."

Taurus nods thoughtfully. "I'm Taurus," she says again, as if that explained it all. "Still, I won't be rude." She finds a spot to sit down, and shows a very odd amount of care before settling herself on the ground. Well, odd at this size. Perhaps not so strange when someone reazlies that most of the time she's 15 meters tall.

With a flick of his hand Tom summons a tea-cup to his hand from some dark corner of the temple, but a chiding cluck from his teacher makes him send it back and instead go fetch the cup again, the hard way. A few minutes later, tea is set out for everyone. The master gets up and stretches himself out a bit, then speaks. "Hallo," he smiles. "No speak..good. Drink, drink." A burst of non-English follows, and Tom nods in response. The master, Exodus, and Thomas all take their cups.

Taurus takes her cup carefully, clearly uncomfortable in such a strange environment. She can stay quiet. She's a bit happier that way. She's mentally griping at Megan for landing her in such a weird situation. Scorpio would have been better for this, anyway. She's mute.

After a few quiet minutes, Tom puts his cup down. "So now you know what we are, and what we are doing here," he says, leaving the rest unspoken.

Taurus looks to Exodus. "I came here because Megan asked. She came here cause that one dragged her here. Into danger." She frowns deeply. "She's not hard as nails, ya know. Show some restraint in the future, you careless fool." She snorts in annoyance at Exodus, looking about ready to butt heads with him just to make her point. "Anyhow.. I'm not sure why we are here. Probably cause Megan was curious."

"I'm here for the cuisine," announces Exodus, as though this answers everything. "Did you guys used to have a restaurant here and I missed it being taken down?" Thomas simply shakes his head no, not really interested in forming a reply to such a question.

"Sometimes I regret Libra's rules on hitting people," says Taurus. She tries to focus on the tea, which is a lot less troublesome than thinking of Exodus. "Anyway, Megan is safe with the rest of the Zodiac at the moment. I apologize for any trouble my presence has caused for you. And I can fix that dent I put in the road, too."

Tom explains this to his mentor, and then relays the reply: "He says, hahaha, that it would be good training for me. So that's okay.."

Taurus smiles uncertainly, "Then I'll leave it, I guess. Sorry about that, though. You didn't really need much help, anyway. I just have a way of putting my horns in where they aren't really wanted, sometimes. You think they all got away okay?"

"You actually helped a lot more than you know," replies Tom, surprisingly. "They thought it was just me up here. That's the second squad they've ever sent. If they think we have people like you on tap, I doubt they'll send a third."

Taurus perks up a bit at that, smiling widely. "Well, I'm glad I could do that at least. It's kind of difficult, fighting people who are so tiny. Especially when you don't want to hurt them very much."

It's at this point that Exodus taps Taurus on the shoulder. He has a goofy grin on his hand, and is holding up the cards - last seen in Tom's hand. No question of how he got them. "Fight me!" he offers brightly. "We're the same size when it comes to cards."

Taurus turns her attention to the teacher, asking, "You seem to have the patience of the trees. Yet I wonder if even you could teach this one how to act properly."

Thomas translates this for the Tibetan priest, who chuckles and replies. Tom relays: "If he stayed here to listen to my teaching, the lesson would already be learned."

Meanwhile, Exodus is growing persistent. "Come ooooon," he says. "I'm hot right now! Lady Luck's on my side, I swear it."

"You are a cheater, I bet," says Taurus. "And I don't like cards. They hurt people too much. Such small things to do it, but many a life has been ruined by them." She ignores Exodus as best she can, wondering if she can distract Thomas and his master enough to stomp on Exodus' foot.

"Fine fine fine," acknowledges Exodus, and the cards disappear from his hands. What replaces them are.. dice. "Okay. Let's go."

"Would anyone here be offended if I knocked him out?" asks Taurus curiously. "He's really annoying. He's the kind of guy Sagittarius would probably go for. Ugh."

"We want to minimize violence here," says Tom firmly. Exodus, meanwhile, has put away the dice and seems to be growing fidgety. It seems that he needs to be out doing something. The priest seems aware of this, but doesn't seem to say much - aside from the small smile quirking the corners of his mouth, he's content to observe. Tom, however, is not quite so relaxed about it. "Anyway, I can show you guys around the village in a little bit. I don't think those soldiers will be back any time soon, so it should be safe."

"That might be a good idea," says Taurus. "I think he's going to explode pretty soon, if you keep him still for much longer." She finds this relationship between master and students (?) very strange. "So is he supposed to be studying here, then?"

"Would do him some good," remarks Tom sourly, earning a brief glare from Exodus. "But the priest accepted me conditionally as a student. Said it was good training for him too, to help the descendant of those who had so oppressed his ancestors."

Taurus raises her eyebrows. "I see.. that sounds complicated." She waits for Thomas to get up to rise herself. "So what is it you learn here, exactly? Is it like all those martial arts movies?"

"Yeah," says Tom, surprisingly. "And patience. And understanding. Watch this." Carefully he draws his hands together, then separates them. "Hey, jackass," he says to Exodus, who glowers quietly. "Flick those cards through here." The teleporter does so, and to his astonishment watches the cards separate into little ribbons that flutter gently to the ground. Thomas closes his hands. "Monowire," he says. "Something I've never been able to do before."

Taurus laughs softly, hearing Exodus get called that. Such an apt title! She wides her eyes as the cards are sliced that way. "That's very impressive," she murmurs. "What kind of powers make that possible?" she asks curiously.

As he waves his hands over the cards, restoring them to their uncut state, Tom explains. "Control of intermolecular forces. I can't turn lead into gold, but if it isn't alive, I can shape it into anything." He nods to the master. "He's got techniques for power like this. Stuff they studied like a billion years ago but couldn't use, 'cause nobody had the gift I do. And so I protect this place for awhile, and learn."

"So what other kinds of powers do they study here?" asks Taurus, growing more seriously interested. "Perhaps the Zodiac could benefit. There is always something to learn, and our situation is.. unique."

Tom shrugs. "Whatever, you know? There's other temples, other teachers, as well. But he won't teach me anything I can't use, won't even talk about it. So you can ask."

"I don't know what I can really learn," says Taurus. "I've never thought about it, you know?" She goes on, explaining, "The things I like to do most have nothing to do with the powers. I like to dance and play music. Unfortunately I'll never be able to perform for many people."

"Why not?" asks Tom.

Taurus sighs, "There you go, Taurus, running your mouth off again." She rolls her eyes, exasperated with her unwise chatter. She does explain, though. "There are people hunting the Zodiac, and they are more powerful than we are. If Capricorn even stops to heal children at a hospital we have to lay low for months. It's sad."

The young man shrugs. "So take 'em down. What do they want from you anyway?"

"For now, they are just hunting. We don't really know why," says Taurus. "And we can't take them down. They have people of power as well. Many people, I think. When you are weaker, you do not fight, you hide." She doesn't seem to like saying that, though.

"So? I'll help you." Tom sounds confident enough. He asides to his teacher for a few moments, engaging in back-and-forth conversation. Then he returns, fire burning in his eyes. "My weapons are everything that exists. I'll be useful."

"If you are serious, I can have you talk to Libra or Virgo," says the bull. "They are the people who make choices like that. I don't want to get you in trouble. And we're trouble. Those soldiers are probably okay to let see me, but anywhere else might draw fast attention from those hunting the Zodiac. Their contacts aren't as strong in the east, though."

"No sweat," Tom says firmly. "I'm used to trouble. .. Hey you!" He points at Exodus, who's been quietly creeping toward the door. "You're helping too, to apologize to my master." The teleporter turns, a guilty look on his face. "Me? .. Help? With what?" Realizing he won't get away with this, he lets his shoulders slump and adopts a crestfallen expression on his face. "Fine, fine."

"Would you like to talk to Virgo, then? It's her turn," says Taurus. Which, upon reflection, the bull thinks sounds really weird. Though it's very accurate. "We try to balance how much exposure each of us has. To keep things fair."

"Fair enough," agrees Tom, then thinks a moment. "Let's talk outside. Then I'll say goodbye to my master."

"I'll go get her," says Taurus. "I'm sorry for all the secrecy. I don't mean to offend. We just try to be very careful." She glares towards Exodus, "We have been tricked before..." She shakes her head, though. She trusts Thomas. Or really wants to. She slips off, going to the same room she used last time. The Zodiac convenes rather quickly, and it seems that they agree that Thomas is reliable. They further agree that Virgo can make the final decision on involving him in their fight. A job that Virgo finds curious. Still, it is her turn, and Libra's will is with her.

While Taurus was rugged and rather pretty, Virgo is a blinding image of beauty. She cannot help but be seen that way, and those around her tend to be drawn in to trust and love her. The woman herself is calm and graceful, her every motion seemingly meant to please the eye. And yet it is not the power of desire that she draws to the mind, but something softer, more gentle and personal. "You are Thomas, and you are Exodus," she says, smiling. "You are both nice men, though one of you likes to get poor Taurus' dander up."

In general this means Exodus will have nothing to say but charming flattery, and nothing to express other than unchecked lecherousness. Tom deals with this with a casual blow to the gut, and while the teleporter is rubbing his abdomen in pain, Tom reiterates his offer: "Whoever these guys are that are after you guys, we'll take care of them."

Virgo smiles, laughing softly. "You definitely have the talent to do so," she says, her voice more serious. "But I'm here to make sure it is something you want to do," she explains. "We try not to get others involved. Megan is already one person we've put in danger. There is a sadness to it. We've made her life so much more difficult."

"Yeah, sure, like having an easy life is something I'm capable of?" asks Tom, though not sourly. He speaks as a man accustomed to this truth. "I'm not accustomed to making offers that weren't my choice, you know?"

"Oh, and I'm sorry. I suppose Taurus said I was coming, but it's rude to not say who I am. My name is Virgo." The young woman laughs a little at herself, going on to explain, "I'm often the butt of jokes among the Zodiac, but they seem to trust my judgement of people. I have an effect on those around me. I hope you don't find it too troubling? If you don't fight it, it causes relaxation."

"Like relaxing is something I do either," retorts Tom with a smile. "Now come on. Have you had enough of running?"

"I don't mind running," says Virgo. "Not if it keeps people from being hurt." Her smile is a sad one, and she looks on the brink of tears. "But I would like to speak out in front of a crowd, and open the minds of those who listen. I very much enjoy speaking publically. I imagine that sounds an odd thing to desire, with all the other things that I could wish for, but that's the one thing I'd like to do. Oh! And to be able to hug a child without knowing that they would be brought in for questioning and told I'm a bad person."

"Then?" asks Tom, shrugging. "How many more people get hurt because this thing you run from is still around?"

"I don't really know," admits Virgo. "Anyway, if you wish to help against them, we need to plan how it should be done." She nods thoughtfully, "We'll need a good plan. They seem to have at least five supers in their organization, and they use all sorts of strange weaponry. Only one of the Zodiac has been able to learn a great deal about them, and that is Scorpio. Unfortunately she's mute, so she can't tell you unless you wish to have her write it all out. Still, she learned much. We found out that they have a base of operations in Millenium City itself. Right under our noses."

Exodus seems to have recovered, and he's now smiling. "Hey, I got somethin to show you guys," he offers brightly.

"What's that?" asks Virgo, her eyes twinkling as she studies the teleporter. She can't help but suspect some mischief of him. After all, it is the way of that man.

Clapping a hand on the shoulders of both people, Exodus only grins. A moment later the scenery has changed completely. The room isn't bare, only Spartan of decoration. Every wall is crammed with shelves, racks, and other storage devices. A worktable rests at the center. And the contents are surprising.

Numerous guns, of all types, are stored on an easy-access rack. Ammunition clips and cartridges, along with loose ammo, are nearby. Boxes are clearly marked with labels such as EXPLOSIVE. Body armor, electricians' tools and other strange things are here. This could be a survivalist's paradise.

"Where is this?" asks Virgo. She frowns at the guns, and even doing that she's beautiful. "Such cruel things, aren't they? A man can stand, smiling in the sun, his family around him, enjoying each other, and with a squeeze someone he's never met or wronged, who might not even see him, could take it all away. It's so sad."

"And a man who's caused the deaths of thousands can be brought low," replies Exodus with a sad smile. "We're underground in the state of Nevada. This is kind of a locker room for stuff I've picked up and thought would be useful."

"Useful for what?" asks Virgo. "Are you looking to overthrow a third world nation or something?" She reaches out to poke Exodus in the ribs, "You wouldn't be a good dictator. I can't imagine you paying attention to anything for more than a few minutes."

"Ha ha ha," the teleporter replies, dodging away. "Anyway, y'know.. Sometimes .. someone just won't change until you shoot them. Now I figure it like this. Would I rather it be me doing the shooting, who is fairly easy-going and polite and considerate and stuff? Or would I rather it be someone who has no conscience, and who's going to keep on hurting people?"

Ming raises an eyebrow, then turns to Thomas. "I don't know when he's joking and when he's being serious," she whispers, purposely doing that loud enough so Exodus can hear, as well.

"I'm serious!" protests Exodus. "You think I like people gettin' hurt, or killed, or whatever? No, fuck that, man!"

"Well, it is good that these are hidden here," says Virgo. "I just hope no one can find them by accident. And in any case, Exodus, I'm not very wise in the use of these things. I'm not a weapon expert, though I do know a thing or two about fighting without them."

"That's fine. I bet this guy will do fine," he says, nodding to Tom, who has already taken it upon himself to investigate some of the weapons. "And if not you, how about pulling a sharper-toothed rabbit out of your hat, hmmmm?"

"Scorpio would go against them," says Virgo, letting out a sigh. "I feel sorry for her. Her turns are always so violent. Libra and I work her very hard. I fear for her, sometimes." Virgo turns to Thomas, "I would like to ask a favor of you, if you are resolved to this. I know I have no right, but this is more important to me than freedom."

Turning from his inspection, Tom glances up. "What's that?"

"I'd like you to help one of my friends," says Virgo. "Not of the Zodiac. I mean Megan. She's very reclusive, and she could use a real friend. Someone who can actually visit her from time to time. If you could help her meet people who won't see her as Star Chyld, it would help quite a bit. I imagine you know some very good people." She looks at Exodus and teases, "And some very strange ones."

"Yeah, I'll do what I can," replies the young man, sounding a little nonplussed about this, but basically agreeable.

"I'm sorry," says Virgo. "I'm always interfering. She's a nice girl, though. And she deserves better." The zodiac shakes it off and looks around some more. "So, do you know how we could blow up their head quarters without hurting anyone who isn't involved?"

"Well, anyone who isn't involved will be outside the headquarters, right?" asks Exodus. "So whatever it is, we seal it off and go nuts."

"If that is what you think is best," says Virgo. She looks to Thomas, a bit curious. "So have either of you done something like this before? You seem to be rather well prepared."

Thomas snaps a clip into one of the Beretta pistols and chambers a round with a quick motion of his hand. Looking up, he smiles. "Nope. Never."
