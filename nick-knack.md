# The Nova
## Character Sheet
**Hero Name**: Nick Knack
**Real Name**: Nicholai Hel

**Look**: man, white (Russian/Tajik), normal skin, normal clothing, fantastical costume

**Abilities**: telekinesis and telepathy - Broad-spectrum psychic powers fueled by psychometry, or absorbing emotional energy from physical items. Out-of-control powers mean that some channeled emotional energy takes over, and the story behind that item takes over whatever Nick wanted to do.		

**Labels**: Danger +1, Freak +2, Savior +0, Superior +0, Mundane +0

**Backstory**:
* *When did you first use your powers?* I've always had a "feeling" about objects. I would pester my mother, a police detective named Anna, if she would let me help with cases. She never did.
* *Who was the first person you accidentally hurt with your powers?* I touched a bundle of paperwork from the hospital and knew my father was not going to make it. I asked my mother about it, and she started to cry. I've run away from home once or twice since then.
* *Who, outside the team, helps you control your powers?* Bernard Black, owner of a used bookstore, tells me stories and shares inspirational lessons (and gives me nostalgia-laden items to fuel my powers)
* *Why do you continue to use your powers?* What use is it to sense how people feel, if I can't make them feel better?
* *Why do you care about the team?* I can keep them safe, and they can help me find ways to help other people.

**When our team first came together**, we destroyed our surroundings in the fight. Where was it? What did we destroy?

TBD

**Relationships**:
* You hang out all the time with TBD to blow off steam
* You once hurt TBD when you lost control of your powers

**Influence**: Happy facade - give influence to three people

**Nova Moves**:
* Burn (flares: Elemental Awareness, Moat, Move, Overpower)

> n. the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness—an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.
