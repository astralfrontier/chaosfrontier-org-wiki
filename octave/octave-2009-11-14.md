"We think they used to live in these caves." Those were the words, the exact words. Herr Doktor I'm sure had no idea of their significance, nor any idea that his offhanded remark made within the labyrinthine tunnels beneath the Pyrenees were what caused my brief but intense psychosis.

My father was an ambassador, back when there were such things as ambassadors, so we traveled a lot. Maybe that's how I got to learn so many languages. And that, in turn, is why I knew when I was a kid I wanted to be an archaeologist. I wanted to be the next Ashcroft, find the secrets that'd make the next D-Engine.

And that's probably why, when the First Arcanotech War broke out when I was still in college, I didn't wait to be drafted. I signed on with the Ashcroft Foundation just as soon as I could. The D-Engine gave us a fighting chance against the Nazzadi - but we needed an edge, and the New Earth Government thought the Foundation would give them that edge. And the Ashcroft Foundation, in turn, thought I could find it.

The living languages I'd learned in high school became the foundation for my learning of dead languages. Starting with the languages humans spoke in ancient times - Chinese, Hebrew, Aramaic - and then moving on to languages the speakers of which were long forgotten. So when they sent us on a trip to the Pyrenees, to explore recently discovered ruins, I _knew_ I'd be the one who'd be able to decipher the secrets we found there.

I wish I hadn't been right.

Oddly enough, my mother was the one who was the most proud of me, when I got into the university of my dreams. She always told me I was brilliant, that I'd go far. My father was the one who worried for me. The Ashcroft Foundation didn't have much to say about their founder, but he'd paid attention to what had happened to the man. I guess my dad knew I'd go far too - he just had a different idea of what that might mean.

My friends in high school thought it was great, of course. They loved asking me what time it was in a dozen different languages, or whatnot. We were young, and we all figured we were indestructible, just like young people do.

We went into the caverns in the mountains. I remember Herr Doktor was explaining about the caves, like I said. I have no idea if anything else happened that day, because the next thing I remember was waking up, strapped to a hospital bed with a bunch of stuff glued to my scalp.

I'm told I was in that hospital for six weeks. They'd run every test I'd ever heard of, and several that I hadn't. At the end of it all, things were starting to come into focus again, and they let me out. At the time, mostly I remember just being vaguely frustrated that I didn't get to go on the trip.

Over the weeks and months to come, of course, my frustration only grew worse. I didn't quite understand why, but I _knew_ my career in archaeology was over. My parents were devastated, though I think my father was secretly relieved. I was still mostly myself, I was still very smart, and I wasn't raving or homicidal. He figured I'd got off easy.

Fortunately, it turned out that my talent for decoding things transferred well to the world of arcanotechnology. After all, the D-Engine was still based on _The Mysteries Within_, and whatever had happened to me in the Pyrenees didn't give me any trouble with _that_ text, or at least those bits of it the Foundation let me read.

I didn't end up inventing anything really new, but I was still pretty good at what I did. I didn't try to figure out too much about _why_ the D-Engine worked, but I did come up with ways to get the most out of its output. I'm told that the transfer mechanism I designed was used in the Broadsword, for example. I didn't date much - I guess I just buried myself in my work, really. But I live comfortably enough - a decent sized apartment, creature comforts. I'm content. Mostly.

Perhaps things would have been different. Perhaps it was for the best that I got out when I did. It was the dreams that did me in in the end, and they are only dreams - products of the mind. No doubt I had simply studied too much. And yet, gentlemen, if you asked me today, I would have said that I was there - really there.

The dreams contain many things, but the most vivid was an almost-memory. It's impossible that I could have actually been there, of course. For where I stood was amongst the ruins of Chicago. The long-dead, desolate, burnt-out shell of a city was bad enough. But the inhuman bodies of my companions, of the creatures who crawled with me there, were far worse. And as one held up the fragments of a human skull, another gestured with a cilia-studded foreleg, pointed at the buildings and the skyscrapers around us. "We think they lived in these caves," it chittered.

Nathan Latham is in his mid-40s. Production of the memory-suppression drug is affordable and we've done the relevant HyMRI mapping necessary to construct the anti-receptors for it. He's physically capable of the task and we think that the memory loss he'll suffer won't impair his functional knowledge of archaeology. He's certified to operate and repair the sifter.
