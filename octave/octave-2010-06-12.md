Orders are coming down. Armitage gathers Nathan, Jamie and Lisa to briefly discuss them.

"Most of our people are undergoing security review," Armitage explains glumly. "Including DeGroot. They're talking about giving us a different crew. I'm pushing back. So are the senior board members."

Jamie looks at Lisa than at Nathan, "It's not like a new crew is going to be any less suseptable to going crazy..."

"Well, you've got to admit that our _previous_ screening procedures let Pierce through," Nathan says. "I don't know what problem they think they have with DeGroot, though I suppose I'm biased in the matter, being as how he's saved my life and all."

Armitage shakes his head. "It's... it's not really that," he explains slowly. "We're supposed to be loyal to our guys. That's the lesson I internalized. You know, if you think about it, loyalty's been at the center of the First Arcanotech War. It's what made mutually hostile nations band together into the NUN, then later the NEG."

Jamie just shakes her head, "It would be nice of people to just band together." She looks back up, "Anyway, how much longer till they're released?"

"_That_ makes sense," Nathan acknowledges. "I guess that's the whole problem with this new... partnership, really. To the Ashcroft Foundation, we aren't their guys. Not yet."

"I don't know," admits Armitage. He pauses. "I don't know." This time, he seems uncertain of more than just a release date. He sits down, covers his face with his hands. And he starts crying.

"Um," says Nathan. He looks around awkwardly, at Jamie, at Lisa, at the wall, and fidgets in his seat. "Is..." he begins, then trails off again, at a loss to help Armitage, or even to know (beyond a very general sense) what the problem even is.

Jamie blinks. ANd then blinks again. For a time, Jamie is uncertain even how to react. She looks at Nathan, and then, rather more pointedly, at Lisa, before turning to Armitage. "Er....."

"We risked our lives and lost people for a cup and a suit of armor. A _cup_. And we _sold_ it." Armitage is sobbing. "It's useless. There really is no stopping them, is there." In the wake of Seattle's fate, there's no need to elaborate on who 'them' must be.

Jamie looks at Armitage. "Shouldn't you be giving us these lectures? The good of the many? The tyrany of democracy? They knew what they were in for?" She looks harder at Armitage, "You talk like they're all not coming back..."

"No, sir," says Nathan straightening in his seat. "Not the cup, or the armor. The most important thing we found in the Carpathians was information. The wards on the tomb, sir. You know something about such things. Where did those wards come from?"

Armitage remains silent for several seconds. "What about the wards, Latham?" he finally asks, composing himself.

"They have no antecedents, sir," Nathan says. "They appear to have been _invented_ at the Carpathian site. Or at least that's the first place they became known to humans. They're subtly unlike any other sorcery we know."

In whatever mental state he's presently in, this doesn't seem to register with the man. "And?"

"Isn't that exactly the sort of thing this project was supposed to be looking for, sir?" Nathan says patiently. "A new source of knowledge. A new way of working with reality. And we _know_ that it's effective against powers from Outside, because that's what it's _doing_." He shakes his head. "The Carpathian site alone isn't much of a weapon. But it points to something larger." Nathan scratches his head. "So. I don't know why you wanted to go to China next... but you're definitely onto _something_."

Lisa looks up. "... We need to talk to someone," she announces abruptly.

Jamie looks, "Someone specific? Or will just anyone do?"

The girl nods. "Field Marshal Vreta."

Continuing the inappropriate sarcasm, Jamie quips, "Oh, yeah. We'll just go walk into his office. I'm sure he won't mind or suspect anything..."

Nathan glares briefly at Jamie, then asks Lisa, "How? I mean, I wouldn't even know how to get on his calendar..."

"Lie," says Armitage at last. "We lie." He fishes in his pocket, pulling a card out of his wallet. "I'll make some calls in the morning."

---

The group reconvenes in the morning, in the Rome apartment where Armitage is staying. The archaeologist is already on a video-terminal, talking to a woman whose hair is tightly packed into a bun, and whose severe eyes burn through rectangular glasses at him. "I'm really not pleased with this turn of events," she's saying, but Armitage waves a dismissive hand at the screen. "Just make it happen," he says firmly.

About twenty seconds after the call disconnects, another one comes in. It's audio only, at first. "Vreta will speak with you in a moment, Dr. Frost," a strange voice says. "This matter is urgent, and we will be following up with our other teams to verify what you say."

The screen flashes. It's filled with a face that everyone in the room has seen. An old face now, black as night, with fanged teeth and red eyes. Met in a dark alley, one might think he'd been accosted by a vampire of particularly distinguished appearance. The background is a soothing computer-generated blur, meant to masquerade whatever details might be present.

"Dr. Frost," the old Nazzadi says. "I'm surprised to hear from someone of your history, sir. Perhaps you'd be good enough to explain what this is about?"

Armitage nods, then gestures quickly at Nathan, pointing him to the video screen.

Nathan almost panics. It's one thing to talk about his findings to Dr. Armitage - or is it Dr. Frost? but that mystery is best saved for later - but to speak to one of the most powerful humans in the world is something else entirely. He swallows, finds his voice. "Our archaelogical expedition, sir, found a tomb. In the Carpathians. The tomb was sealed with wards of a kind that have no precedent in any other known sorcery. We think they may be a fundamentally new _kind_ of magick."

Vreta glances down. Nathan knows from experience that the man is reading text off a HUD. "I see. And this is why your, uh, expedition fell under attack?"

"I don't know, sir," replies Nathan. "But it could be. Whoever attacked us certainly thought we were onto something and didn't want us to have any more of it. I can't guess what they thought they knew."

"Sir.." Lisa begins hesitantly. Vreta looks up, a bit startled. She continues regardless. "Sir, there's only one other.. group.. that we _know_ drove back the Migou on Earth."

Vreta takes a deep breath and sucks for a moment on his teeth, considering this. "I'm retired, miss.." His eyes dart to the invisible text on his end of the screen. "Miss Lazarus. I can't authorize an Antarctic expedition. Your own company's founders should know very well what's down there. If I follow your logic, you hope to examine the old ruins, see if anything there aligns with Mr. Latham's findings?" Lisa nods.

Jamie looks at Dr. Armitage. "Surely this is something we need to do? If the wards were worth finding... isn't it worth finding more?" She ignores the unknown part about 'What they found in Antarctica'. Questions for later.

"Antarctica?" Nathan says, suddenly sitting straight in his seat. He looks at Lisa nervously. "I... I mean..." He coughs. "I... I guess I hadn't fully thought through the implications of my work," he says weakly.

"Field Marshal, I've read everything you've ever written," Lisa says softly. "Even some of your unpublished letters." Vreta scowls a bit, but lets this pass silently. "Sir, you once said that the Migou are _afraid_ of us. Isn't.. isn't this what they have to be afraid of?"

Vreta considers this silently.

Nathan settles back into his chair, looking off into the distance. The brief period without his medication was deeply disturbing enough - but Antarctica! That's almost like encountering such things in the waking world. Contemplating an expedition _there_ fills his heart with a nameless dread. Still, he reflects, what weight does his own sanity carry when the survival of humanity hangs in the balance opposite it?

"They won against the Migou," concedes Vreta. "And what they lost against may still be down there. But I'll make some calls. The _Dreadnaught_ won't be at your discretion, but if there's enough sympathetic officers on board, you can at least see what they have to say."

Jamie nods to the screen. "Thank you, sir." SHe's not sure where she's going, but it seems appropriate.

Vreta nods. "Come see me after this is all over, Frost," he says at last. "I'd enjoy meeting you one of these days." And the screen goes dark.

Jamie looks directly at Nathan, "So. What is down there? How likely are we going to die?" She asks, pointedly.

Nathan shakes his head. "Dying isn't what I'm afraid of." He smiles thinly. "Though from what you told me the other day, I'm not worried about it happening to _you_." He glances at Armitage. "I'm not expecting an answer, but I'd never live with myself if I didn't at least _ask_: Dr. Frost?"

"It's not my real name," Armitage answers calmly. "Then again, my real name's not even my real name."

"Right," Nathan says. "That sounds like a rabbit hole a bit too deep for me." He looks nervously to the south. "Of course, the one we're talking about jumping into is pretty damn deep, too."

Jamie returns Nathan's thin smile, "Oh, I'm sure that there's still horrible things that can happen to me." She just nods silently at this last.

Armitage shrugs. "Nathan, have you ever played a role so long you started to live it? Irresponsible bachelor to dutiful husband. Pacifist to military man. Atheist to Christian, or vice versa? If not, I'm not sure if I can ever explain it."

Jamie looks at Dr. Armitage, "Any part we play. Any role we take ultimately becomes part of us. Sometimes the hiding is the real thing."

Nathan shakes his head. "Not really, sir. Closest I come is being an archaeologist pretending to be an arcanotech."

Armitage shrugs. "Well. I suppose it's decided then. We'll keep doing our digs. And we'll see if an opportunity presents itself."
