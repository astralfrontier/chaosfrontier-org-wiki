DeGroot has been taken aside by agents of the Federal Security Bureau. What men of the FSB want with him shouldn't be hard to guess: he's to undergo a security screening now that Starkweather has fallen under the aegis of the Ashcroft Foundation and the NEG itself.

They review his dossier and his history in his presence, ask him questions while connected to a biomonitor and psych-screener, and make calls to third parties, speaking in hushed tones and mentioning names or places. Some of these are familiar to DeGroot from his past; others are not.

DeGroot tries to keep his cool through the whole thing. He gives complete answers to questions he's asked, and nothing else. He doesn't ask any questions of his own. He doesn't try to hide his discomfort from the machines. From experience, DeGroot knows that there's no fooling them - and it will only give the spooks a reason to keep him there longer. Besides, desk-jockeys are used to a banker's schedule; so there's no reason to worry unless he's there longer than eight hours. DeGroot has spent longer in tiny cockpits, getting shot at. _And the crash in the desert sure felt longer than eight hours_, he recalls with a mild shudder.

At length a man comes in, asks DeGroot to stand, shakes his hand, and transfers a file to his PCPU before leaving. DeGroot reviews the file. Whatever's going on here must be big. Or things are desperate. It's a government pension which will last for the rest of his life. However long the NEG thinks that'll be.

DeGroot quickly digests the contract, and it's implications. He should be happy; usually you have to serve forty years in someone's uniform before getting this kind of deal. And who knows; he might live long enough to collect. But his enthusiasm is muted by the knowledge that someone has to save the world before that can happen, and that's a long shot, at best. He pockets his battered handheld with a shrug and asks to be shown the door.

Most of the _Moore_'s crew passed security muster immediately. A few days' worth of calls between Armitage and some of his contacts finally suffice to get the other survivors transferred back in as well.

Jamie is missing, but Armitage assures those few who do ask that she's fine. McTavish adds that she was escorted from Rome by a strange man, and Albez makes him as an agent of the Office of Internal Security. "Yes, I know," Armitage replies. "It's fine. She'll be back with us shortly."

Orders come across the pilot board. "_Jeremiah Moore_ is to disembark and rendezvous outside Rome airspace with NEG carrier _Dreadnought_. Flight plan will be transmitted to _Moore_ at that time."

DeGroot straps into the pilot's chair and secures the bridge. The sound of the magnetic bolts sliding home is somewhat comforting; after the last mission, he's not taking any chances. He pours over every available sensor, looking for any anomoly, and finding none, he taps out a response. They'll head straight for the _Dreadnought_, as ordered.

The _Dreadnought_ is a massive ship, compared to the _Moore_. It could carry a small village in it - houses, shops, roads. It hangs above the Italian plains in silent disregard for such trifles as gravity. As the _Moore_ approaches, the pilot's board flickers to life again. Text only - how polite. "Flight plan incoming." A stream of data begins flowing next to the output. "_Moore_ will accompany _Dreadnought_ to previous dig site in China. To avoid Migou patrols, we are taking a detour."

It's a hell of a detour. Right over the south pole. Vreta came through.

DeGroot opens a conference window and invites the core team - Armitage, Solak, Latham, and Lazarus. "We've been granted an opportunity," he begins. "Tell me how to make the most of it."

Nathan's eyes flick offscreen for a moment, and then widen. "We're really going to do it..." he breathes. "I..." He swallows, then smiles faintly. "I suppose it's fate."

"Try not to think of _why_," DeGroot mutters. "Think of what we need to do. We're going to be there in less than ten hours, and we'll have only a few hours of loiter time."

Nathan nods. "I'll start uploading data digests into my PCPU. And double-check my access level for some of the restricted files. There's a _lot_ about this site that's on a need-to-know basis, and we're some of the few people who actually do need to know."

"Nathan, come by my quarters for a copy of the Dyer report, and Mr. Starkweather's final report as well. We have everything we need." Armitage shakes his head. "All those sacrifices won't go to waste."

When Nathan arrives, Armitage surprises him. What he hands over is paper - no digital records. "The narrative of Professor William Dyer," he explains, holding up one sheaf. "And the official report of the Starkweather-Moore Antarctic expedition. The one that founded our company, incidentally."

Nathan takes the sheaf solemnly. "I can tell I've got a lot of reading to do," he says. He turns, and taps the bulkhead lightly. "And thus Starkweather and the _Moore_ return once more from whence they came."

"A mere philosophical point," adds Armitage. "If Dyer's report hadn't been suppressed at the time, that expedition may never have happened. Would we be better or worse for it? But enough about that."

"Well, were it not for _that_ expedition, we may never have known to go on _thos_ one," Latham observes. "I guess we'll soon find out whether or not we'll be better for it. Anything else?"

DeGroot pings Lisa a few moments later. He's still up on the bridge; she's down in her cabin, with her piles of books, new and old. "Jeremiah Moore - or at least his namesake - is returning to the place of his downfall. The heirs of his best friend are here for a second chance." He pauses. "I know squat about magic, but I read Joseph Campbell once. Do we get any points for retracing the steps of a fallen hero?"

"Not if it leads off a cliff," is Lisa's laconic reply.

DeGroot sighs, and logs off. He sets up a duty roster for the Antarctic overflight - three shuttles in the air, scanning; the fourth back on the _Moore_, with Latham and the sifter, ready to go as soon as they find something worth digging up. Risky, but viable. He sets to work on the details.

The Starkweather-Moore report is daunting reading. What was originally intended to be a routine geological survey on the Antarctic continent instead uncovered a vast mountain range where none was expected to be. And even that in itself would be unremarkable, were it not for the signs that the mountain range was artificial - and at the same time, far older than human civilization.

A small group investigated the mountains further; it is their report that forms the bulk of the survivors' findings. Beyond the mountain range were the unmistakable ruins of a vast city or metropolis of unmistakably non-human construction. Only stone had survived the vast aeons since the city's abandonment, but carvings, mosaics, and alien lettering told the hints of an alien race that had lived and thrived in the days before humanity, and had manipulated the evolution of life on Earth, possibly even that of humanity itself. And of a war with deadly foes, both from beyond the stars and from Earth itself.

Armitage chimes in once Nathan concludes. "Whatever .. might be left down there, was once controlled by a sort of hypnotic suggestion by these Old Ones. The Old Ones are described as tremendously advanced in their evolution, but so little change seems indicated during their tenure on Earth. It's possible that their creations are similarly atavistic. If so.." He glances at Lisa.

The girl sighs. "Glad to know it wasn't just my archaeological qualifications that got me on board. Have you been planning this from the start?"

Armitage shakes his head. "The discovery that led us down here didn't happen until after you were confirmed, Miss Lazarus. Relax yourself." Lisa bites her lip, but doesn't say anything else.

The Miskatonic Expedition's original camp was long since destroyed. The Starkweather-Moore Expedition reportedly took shelter in a cave. From the sightings taken against the nearby terrain, both _Moore_ and _Dreadnought_ concur that they've arrived. The godless white expanse of the Antarctic greeted them, and memories of previous visits here - from the Miskatonic's fateful trip to the famous _Endurance_ and Shackleton's heroic crew, paralleled half a century later by the Apollo 13 mission.

The cameras train themselves on the nearby mountains. It doesn't take long to establish the next course to take. Across a pass, into a high plateau nestled between these southern mountains and their further cousins - what Dyer described as "mountains of madness".

The _Moore_ threads a gap between titan peaks at 23,000 feet. Some of the spires sport incongruous, blocklike shapes near their tops, half-hidden behind thin sheets of stratospheric clouds. Once beyond the pass, the mountains fall quickly to a vast plateau, and the _Moore_ confronts an otherworldy landscape. In ancient times these lands may have been lush and fertile, but they are now a vast desert of rocky grey plains dominated by a giant frozen river.

But the magnificent desolation is only impressive for a moment, for the plateau is dominated by a vast assemblage of buildings assembled from massive cubes of stone, like the toy blocks of a child who would himself have to be a mile tall. The ancient city goes on for miles - filling the 'lowlands' of the ancient basin, although even the lowest point can't be at an altitude of less than eight thousand feet. Bigger than modern rome, thousands of times older, and utterly devoid of any sign of habitation. Just looking upon the thing is staring deeply into an abyss of time, as empty and inhuman as the space it inhabits.

The _Moore_ makes a slow circle of the city, while the _Dreadnought_ takes up a covering position near the pass. The massive battleship is barely in scale with the city, but in stark contrast to its ancientness. Everyone who sees the two objects in perspective, through the deck cameras on the _Moore_, is left with the impression that the city tolerates these ultramodern intruders only grudgingly.

"They made us," murmurs Armitage, almost to himself. "If Dyer's report is right, they are our creators. No wonder the Church wanted his narrative suppressed."

"We think our creators used to live in these caves," Nathan murmurs, his voice quavering. He doesn't know quite why he said that, nor why the words fill him with dread.

_Dreadnought_'s security officer sent a mail to Armitage. Now the scientist reads it aloud. "'We have some recon arachnoids that should be compatible with your systems. Fairly expendable. No need to send a human down. Signal if you want us to deploy a nest of them.'"

Armitage closes the mail. "This sounds wise to me. Mr. DeGroot, will you make the arrangements?"

DeGroot nods an affirmative and taps out a reply. It seems odd that all the communications with the battleship are by text only; either someone's got a serious bug about security, or... something weird is going on. He pauses briefly and thumps the control panel. "Bloody hell. This is going to make a crazy man out of me." He tasks a fraction of his HUD to monitoring comm traffic and sets an expert system to work on it; no getting caught off guard, like last time.

From the _Moore_, the launch is a subtle thing. A few A-Pod powered cylinders touch down lightly at different points of the city. Hundreds of scuttling machines pour out of each one, fanning out. Images begin coming in. Hundreds of frames per second from each vantage point, and hundreds of POVs. The software onboard begins to assemble these into a jigsaw puzzle of light via the holographics of the bridge. The city takes shape before the eyes of the crew.

Armitage selects a few images from the videostream, gesturing and flicking them about. "We'll want to set up some LAIs to process these images," he says, indicating one example. It features what look to be tentacled vegetables manipulating a set of boxes. "The LAI should sort by activity category. Then we'll know just where we want to focus."

It takes half an hour to do the work. The spiders continue their relentless observation. By this time most of the city has been mapped out in rough detail. It didn't take long to set them to focus on the cartouches that decorate almost every wall in every building.

"We've fed in a rough profile of the Migou," Armitage says at last. "We'll be looking for anything that matches them to start with."

The signal finally chimes after two hours. Per the program, the holographics switch from the overall city view to a side-scrolling two dimensional view of the carvings. The LAI has attempted to arrange them in chronological order by laser-scanning the stone and analyzing its age, but that's not perfect.

Both Nathan and DeGroot arrive at the same conclusion via different disciplines. What Dyer described as "filtering down from the stars on membranous wings" seems to be a metaphor. The Old Ones, like the Migou, are described as arriving on the Earth via an exactingly specific set of geometric diagrams. Angles and lines are depicted as converging on a specific set of values. They are the rotation of the Earth around its axis, its rotation around the Sun, and its axial tilt.

"There are witch cults said to have traveled to meet the Devil via various angles," muses Armitage. "As though the right geometry could actually shift you through space and time."

"But..." DeGroot hazards. "Isn't that what the D-Engine does?"

Nathan would be the natural man to answer a question of that sort. Anyone expecting an answer from him, however, would be disappointed, as the man appears to be staring blankly into space, slack-jawed.

Lisa stares at Nathan silently.

After a few seconds, Nathan staggers forward, bracing himself on the back of a chair. He turns sluggishly to DeGroot, blinking. "You're... more right than you know..." he mumbles, before shaking his head. His voice steadies, as if he's forcing himself to be calm with great effort. "There was a device. In my apartment. I... I'm pretty sure I constructed it, though I don't remember doing so. It had no electricity. No power source. Just a very specific set of measurements and angles. But... when I left the room and came back... it was gone."

"The D-Engine... yes, there's something to that," Nathan continues. "When it's built... parts of it extend beyond the world we know. D-Engine design uses that fact in very constrained ways. It's... dangerous to go beyond the known safe parameters. Well, known to be safe so far."

"Wait," DeGroot says. "Are you saying that you build a d-engine in your apartment - and you didn't remember doing it? And someone stole it?"

Nathan shakes his head. "It wasn't a D-Engine. It was something else, on extradimensional parameters. And no one stole it. It was just... gone." He fixes DeGroot with a stare. "You've got to understand - my medication keeps me from remembering the things that scare me." His face is pale. "Perhaps when they've worn off completely, I'll... remember building it too."

DeGroot chooses not to pursue the point. Instead, he looks at Armitage, on the far side of the hologram. "This doesn't sound like it's telling us where to dig - or even if we need to."

"We're not digging up anything, except metaphorically," Armitage answers softly. "But the Old Ones defeated the Migou. They drove the Migou away, came to terms with them. Instead of just exterminating them... so they had the power. But _why_? It all ended so comparatively peacefully."

"Maybe that's a different mural," DeGroot suggests. "Some later point in time, with different iconography."

"Refuted by the continued existence of this city," the scholar replies absently, staring at the images hanging in space. "If the Migou had attacked later, they'd attack here. But we know what overcame this place."

DeGroot takes up station again, leaving the analysis to the scholars. His priority now is to watch the skies... But a minute later, he splits the HUD again, displaying the 'descent of the Old Ones'. Man only ever went ankle-deep into cosmic space, and DeGroot was one of the lucky few to do so. He can't resist the implication of the mural. _A means to visit other stars? And Latham built one, maybe?_
