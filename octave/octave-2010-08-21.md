Jamie has stompped around in the water, pretty much afraid to say anything, both because she's not sure what would happen, and in particular because she has a reason to try and go unnoticed, as unlikely as that is. She spends some time trying to determine what the liquid they're in the tube with is without actually poisoning herself, and some careful watching of the Elder Ones.

Jamie finally takes a sip of what will turn out to be water, "I wonder why they put us in water...."

DeGroot tests the fluid as well, going to far as to taste it. "They were going to dissect us... maybe this is their... tool. You saw what they did to the stone, right? When they came to get us? It just dissolved." He stirs the pool a bit. "Maybe they can control water the same way. I thought it might have been nanotech, but that seems... too crude, for them. I wonder if they ever had nukes, or if atomic technology is beneath them."

DeGroot checks Lisa's vitals... still unconscious, but not getting worse, at least. "Maybe they do everything with sorcery. They called Earth 'the Holy Place', and they talk about this rhythm that depends on the length of the day and the length of the year. But there's lots of planets like that, right? So what happens if the length of a day changes? Like, how the day was shorter in the time of the dinosaurs? Does that make Earth less 'holy'? Or does the cosmic rhythm change to match it?"

Nathan's eyes widen. "It's not something that occult scholars really thought about much. All the old books of lore more or less _assume_ a certain number of hours per day, days per year, and so on. But... yes, changing the length of the day would change things. The length of the year even more so."

"So if we had a hundred million year old magic book, we might be able to tell if Earth is _a_ holy place, or _the_ Holiest Place." DeGroot shrugs, and goes back to monitoring Lisa. "I just hope that the Elders don't thik we're desecrating it. Like rats in the walls of Solomon's Temple, or something."

"There's the Pnakotic Manuscripts themselves," Nathan says. "They certainly go back that far. If we have time when we get back, we can look into it."

---

Lisa comes round about the time the Elder Thing returns, with what amounts to an armed escort party. They carry peculiar devices of fluted metal attached to bladders filled with a liquid which seems to hum when it sloshes about.

"Thou art prepared for the journey?" the Elder Thing asks. "Thou shalt recall thyselves to the holy place in the manner in which thou arrived here. We shall follow thee."

"I hope you're feeling better, Lisa," Nathan says. "I know this wasn't easy for you the first time." His PDA flickers as he studies the ritual coordinates, mentally rehearsing crucial parts of the spell.

Deactivating the PDA again, Nathan turns to the others. "All right. Calm yourselves, just like before." He takes a deep breath; he knows that this works now, but every trip is a new set of angles, and a subtly different mindset. He begins the chanting, with careful, precise gestures in the prescribed directions.

The return trip is just as abrupt as the original. This time, however, the group find themselves in the frozen antarctic city itself. Not in any of the buildings - standing in a vast open space between the forgotten stone structures.

In a circle around them, twelve of the Elder Things likewise materialize without preamble. Their membranous wings are stretched to their limits, and seem to be glowing for a moment as the sorcerous act completes itself.

DeGroot glances around frantically at the cold, immense arena, catching sight of the _Dreadnought_ several miles away. "Oh, hell, of course. You come in at the gate, not the baggage claim."

Jamie shoots a look over to DeGroot and Armigate as they land, "Radio the ship.... Oh wait." Jamie's arms wrap around herself.

The Things take stock of their situation; a few move into closer proximity to the human team, while others point with their tentacles or sing their strange piping song to each other. "This is the holy city?" asks the Elder Thing which spoke earlier. "This city hath lain in ruins for much time."

"It has. Since before our species learned the power of speech, as far as we can tell," says Nathan.

Some of the Things sing to each other, and the cilia atop the English-speaking Thing's head writhe in some peculiar acknowledgement. "Three of us will accompany thee to thy refuge," it announces. "If thou hast a means of transport, invoke it presently."

"Make sure to warn the _Moore_ and _Dreadnought_ that we have company," Nathan points out to DeGroot. "They will need to clear the deck when we arrive." He shudders, remembering his own reaction to the Old Ones' first appearance.

Jamie looks to Nathan, "I'm frankly more worried about the company we had when we left." She darts a glance to the Elder One, then up to the sky.

Nathan shakes his head at Jamie. "If they didn't interfere with us before, they won't now. Especially now."

DeGroot calls the _Dreadnought_ first, and warns them about their 'guests'. He obtains permission to evacuate the _Moore's_ remaining crew, to spare them the shock of contact with the Elder Things... and to remove the risk of someone going mad and assaulting them. The crew of the _Moore_ is ordered to evacuate in one shuttle, and send another down on LAI pilot.

The shuttles are soon visible as specks in the distance, moving between the small shadow of the _Jeremiah Moore_ and the huge bulk of the _Dreadnought_, though both look trivial compared to the crumbling Elder architecture. DeGroot turns to the Elder Thing that seemed most interested in the humans, though for all he knows, it's a completely different individual. "I suspect you have not visited us in some time," he begins. "Though I am sure you will still find them crude, we have become skilled with machines in your absence. The Migou have chosen to fight us with similar machines."

"I hath not visited the holy place," the Thing answers. "Nor hath other expeditions made the journey. We shall learn what our kin hath rendered upon the stone of their homes and profit from its instruction."

"Then allow us to aid you," DeGroot continues. "The smaller vessel is a research craft. We have devices aboard for remote imaging. They may speed your search." He neglects to mention how much of the city has already been imaged.

The Thing speaks after a moment. Its tone of voice is just as even as usual; whatever emotions it may feel seem not to enter into its pronounciation of English. "We have perceived that thy senses are woefully limited. Thy apprehension of the records may likewise be incomplete. Thine offer of assistance is ... appreciated."

"You may still need to inspect the city in person, then," Nathan notes. "Our machines' senses are more acute and varied than our own, but they're most likely still limited by your standards."

DeGroot nods in acknowledgement, but doesn't speak further. _Like children. Or worse, pets... or cattle._ He shakes his head. _Space travel. Shit. I should have been a football coach._

The shuttle touches down. The crew board. The _Moore_'s shuttles have limited seating but plenty of cargo, and no passenger facilities aboard any of the human craft seem adequate to the Things' physiology.

The return flight to the _Moore_ is quiet. Human breathing is a distinct sound, but easily ignored once you get used to it - you hear it your whole life, and tend to disregard it when heard from other people. What the Things are doing is something else entirely. They do seem to respirate, but the noise is unlike anything the five travelers have heard from earthly animals.

The shuttle docks. The group makes its way to the bridge. "We hath perceived that thine enemies are present and hath still respected the old taboos," the Thing mentions to DeGroot. "Invoke thy means of speaking to them that we may settle this matter."

DeGroot settles into the control pod. "They don't often answer," he says. Still, the NEG has worked out a few communication protocols, usually used only in the vain hope of surrender or for defiant last words. He finds one of them, a sporadic buzzing carrier. "It's transmitting. Speak and they will hear you."

The Thing begins to 'speak' in its wide-ranged musical piping. After a few moments, something else happens. There's a response. It's not even an audio signal, simply a coded acknowledgement in the NEG's own scheme.

"This device transmits the sense of sight, does it not?" the Thing asks.

DeGroot raises an eyebrow. _The Migou want to speak to the Things? That's new._ He wordlessly enables the camera and points. "That thing has about the same sensitivity as our own eyes." _Limited as I'm sure you'll say that is._

The Thing directs its attention to the camera and makes a queer curling gesture with some of its tentacles. Nathan recognizes it as a variant of the Voorish Sign, but with something else added; Armitage lets out a low gasp, indicating that he too recognizes the significance.

The sensor board begins registering movement. DeGroot double-checks his readings. But what he sees is the case: the Migou ships are retreating from this airspace.

"What the hell goes on over there?" comes a new audio stream - the captain of the _Dreadnought_.

DeGroot can hardly believe it himself; he's been staring slack-jawed at the radar projection. "Sir, the Elder Things just asked the Migou to leave. And they did." After a moment, he adds, "Call Vreta, if you can. He needs to know."

"I... alright, whatever." This is a little over the captain's pay grade. "My orders still stand, however. Escort you to the Chinese dig site."

Jamie looks at DeGroot, "I would say that Vreta is probably our next stop. After they look at the city, of course."

DeGroot looks at Armitage. "Does that matter anymore?"

Armitage in turn defers to the Thing. "Can you make them leave us alone no matter where we go?" he asks.

Jamie looks, "Hopefully without them retaliating elsewhere..."

"I reminded thy foes of what hath been observed to sleep beyond the mountains and that thy death would be a small price for the eradication of their people within this sun's realm. So chastened, they seem reluctant to test our resolve. However, do not consider us a talisman against their malice."

Jamie ponders, thinking about the one passage . o O ( a small price )

DeGroot says, "Why would _they_ care if we live or die?" DeGroot asks, with obvious surprise. "They've been doing a pretty good job of making us extinct so far."

"If thy kind should die by the hand of that which sleeps beyond, we should be quite inconvenienced," the Thing explains.

DeGroot ican almost look the Thing in one of its eyes many eyes. "Because it will desecrate the Holy Place? Or does that thing, that even you fear, _make_ this the Holy Place?"

The Thing's tendrils writhe briefly. "It would require that we find a new world. For this one could nevermore be visited."

DeGroot pales, and slumps back into his seat. "Someone tell me where we're going."

"China," says Armitage firmly. "This is still our fight to win."

---

The journey to the deserts of China is surreal. The group remembers its time here before. Now, with a heavily armored battleship of the NEG escorting them, and representatives of the Elder Things aboard, it's not clear whether to feel more safe, or less.

The original plan to digitally scan the terrain is assisted by the _Dreadnought_ and its own shuttles and sensors. In time the correct location is found, and a shuttle bearing a sifter is dispatched.

In under an hour, sand has been cleared away from the ruins. A team of NEG marines remains in the air aboard one of _Dreadnought_'s troop transports, while another is hot and ready to go in the launch bay. The _Moore_ crew are on the ground, along with the three Things which accompanied them.

The tomb, or temple, or whatever it is, seems similar in nature to that found in the Carpathians. The ritual incantations are different in their specifics, but there are too many general similarities to dismiss a connection.

One of the Things sings to its fellows, indicating sections of the stone, and the English-speaking creature accosts the archaeologists. "By whom was this built?" it asks.

"We don't know exactly," replies Nathan. "A little under three thousand years ago. By humans native to this part of the world, most likely."

"Thine handiwork hath impressed me," the Thing says after a moment. "Shall I tell thee the significance of what my fellows hath remarked upon?"

Nathan is nonplused. "Uh... yes. Please," he says bashfully.

"Thy world sits balanced upon the forces which revolve it and which in turn cause it to revolve about its sun. These must necessarily decay over time." The Thing gestures with a tentacle. "Engraved upon these walls is the tale of what my kinsmen did upon discovering this holy place. They made supplication to the great powers of the world. That which shall have the power to hold the stars and the celestial bodies in place, or as Great Cthulhu and others of His kind shall decree, to call them to other places and times."

"This supplication bound these powers in part to this world, causing that its revolution shall not cease, nor that its speed shall ever slacken. In this manner its attunement to the Walpurgis rhythm would stay perfected forevermore."

Nathan is slackjawed. "Holy sh-" he begins, then checks himself, turning to DeGroot. "Well, there's your answer to orbital decay," he says faintly. "The cosmic powers of the Universe hold the Earth in its orbit."

The Thing continues. "What we remark upon is this. Thy kin hath altered the terms of this binding, hath thought to control it to a greater or lesser degree. Like Great Cthulhu, they seem to propose to drag this world to some other place or time upon the right occasion."

Jamie can't help herself and looks at the thing, what she thinks of as the leader, "The right occasion?" She asks.

"Wait," DeGroot says. "Humans did _that_? Three thousand years ago?"

The Thing wriggles. "Verily. Upon the observance of the correct ritual, it shall be so."

Jamie mutters, "Well, at least it's not a time bomb."

"Wow," Nathan says. "Talk about meddling with powers beyond our comprehension. Or did they know about the Walpurgis-rhythm?" He shakes his head. "But... what would we accomplish by doing that?"

"Get away from the fucking Migou, for one," DeGroot mutters.

"I think I see why," whispers Armitage. "Don't you get it? Cthulhu. The Migou. The Elder Things. It's--"

Lisa speaks up. She hasn't said anything since the return. "Jerusalem. It's the holy city. Holy to everyone, even enemies of each other."

The girl goes on. "But us, we don't care about it being Jerusalem. We don't need a holy city. We just need a place. So.. we were prepared to take away the holy place from everyone else."

Nathan shakes his head. "Holding our own planet hostage," he says, numbly.

"Thou would have faced strenuous objection in this matter from my kin," the Elder Thing states flatly. "However, given the destructive and corrupting forces I have witnessed so proximate to the Walpurgis flow, I now cannot wholly affirm that such a decision would be for the worst. Perhaps such sacred worlds are not meant to be."

"One last thing," DeGroot asks. "How much of this was written in ancient Chinese, and how much of it extrasensory encoding? Much of the writing at the previous dig site was only visible when... umm... Latham and Armitage did some..." he trails off. "I don't know what the hell they did."

"The Powder of Ibn Ghazi," Nathan remarks. "A magical dust that reveals the arcane to human eyes."

"We know not thy tongue," the Thing says, gesturing with a tentacle up into the heavens. "Thy limited apprehension be a burden, I wager. See thou not the pillar yonder?"

Nathan shakes his head. "See it we do not," he confirms.

Jamie shakes her head, "I'm afraid we dont, no."

"How thou came upon such a matter I shall not deign to guess," the Thing says in what could be heard as disappointment.

Nathan seems to awaken from his stupor of astonishment. "These... 'destructive and corrupting forces'. You mentioned them before, when you first met us. What are you referring to? What effects do they have?"

The Thing regards Nathan. "Consider thine own self, as a matter of instruction. Thou art sadly limited in all particulars, with faculties of the larger world so gravely impaired that even the children of mine own kin would surpass thy great thinkers. Thou art composed of no mean matter, but being the product of this place thou art burned and deformed by the presence of the cosmic forces which seethe below thy aware mind."

"Consider then a flame. It burns brightly and hath many useful properties, but place something combustible too close to it and it shall wither and scorch. Thou art such a thing. By thy proximity thou art warped out of true."

"Extremophile bacteria," DeGroot says. "You can find them everywhere - volcanos, acid caves, hell, they even find things living in the sludge at Chernobyl. But they're always simple, unorganized life-forms." He can't help but chuckle. "Maybe we only lasted this long out of our pig-ignorance, our lack of senses for such things."

"Moths to a flame," murmurs Lisa. And Armitage nods to DeGroot. "I think you're right. Human senses accommodate a continual input by ignoring that input. Too loud a sound, and we tune it out. We must be doing the same with these cosmic forces."

"And yet, we gained some ability to manipulate them, after all," says Nathan. "The D-Engine. Sorcery. Things like this," he adds, nodding toward the Chinese ruins. "But even then, we recognize them as dangerous."

---

Back aboard the _Moore_, Jamie receives a private message. The ship is preparing to return to North American airspace on an emergency flight plan, and her message seems relevant. It's from a contact in the Society.

Jamie checks around, to make sure there's not many onlookers, then pulls out her PDA and reads the message.

"OIS arrested high-level NEG personnel for buying dangerous magical artifacts from the Arcane Underground. Complication is that they're the ones Starkweather sold off. Info comes via contacts within GIA. Starkweather likely to be investigated, maybe implicated."

"Arrested personnel involved in investigation of project codename FUTILE OCTAVE. More information available - it seems Vreta's on your side. Ask him for clearance to brief the others."

Jamie reads then. Then again.. Then a third time, her knuckles turning white with how hard she is gripping the screen. She breathes. One, twice. Then stands, concientiously putting the PDA away, when marches purposfully to Armitage, wherever he might be. "Vreta. How can I call him. Now." She is looking at the ground, noticably upset, and is spoken more like an order than an request.

Going through channels courtesy of the _Dreadnought_'s commander, whose orders came indirectly from the field marshal anyway, Jamie gets ahold of the elder Nazzadi man in under thirty minutes.

Jamie breathes deeply, trying to sink and bury her rage for another moment, one that may soon come. "The OIC. What do they want, how long do we have, and more importantly, can I tell the others?"

"What are you talking about?" Vreta asks calmly.

Jamie looks at the monitor. She had, foolishly, assumed he'd know. "The OIC is making some arrests in connection with objects which we found previously. They're likely to come after us soon, and I'm assuming they won't like what they find." She pauses for a second, "They were working on FUTILE OCTIVE." She says, gravely.

This is something Vreta seems to recognize. "We'll share, then," he says after a moment. "Once I know how you heard this name, I'll tell you what I can."

Jamie stops for a second, and looks at the screen. She would probably be amazed at how much he knows. Still, caution is best. "I admit I have only heard the term a few times. This time it came to me through an aquantiance with some contacts at the GIA."

"An acquaintance that Frost.. er, Armitage will vouch for?" asks Vreta calmly.

Jamie pauses again, "An acquauntance that at least knew of your interest in our expeditions." She looks down, then back up.

"You're being too vague for my taste, young lady," Vreta answers. "Dr. Frost and I go back a long ways. But you.. I don't know you. I need more than that." He leans forward on the screen, clasping his fingers together.

Jamie sighs, "I apologize. Armitage probably doesn't know my contact. He is with the Eldritch Society."

Vreta swallows. This seems to have impressed him. "Are you one of them?" he asks at last. "If so, show me. I've seen worse, I assure you."

Jamie closes her eyes and concentrates. A thick black smoke ALMOST seems to roll off of Jamie as she changes, but if one were to look closely, you could see that it's actually being collected from the latent death that surrounds her, skin, bugs, ehat have you are all drawm to the dark, tall, gangley form that Jamie's arms twist themselves into as the lets the beast inside of her out once more. He face is masked in almost perpetual shadow as she looks at the screen, her voice taking on a deep, definitive quality, "I'm sure you have. And I no doubt you will see more." Her voice seeths with distain and death.

Vreta watches. He's calm, but Jamie knows that it doesn't come without effort. Finally he speaks.

"Well. FUTILE OCTAVE is the NEG codename for a Migou weapon system, or proposed weapon system. Something that according to intelligence would wipe out all human life on earth, and probably wipe out the Deep Ones as well. Something non-nuclear in its applications. I was consulted on the project because of my past experience with Migou technology, and I can tell you conclusively that they had no such weapons system before coming here."

"Now you'd asked about the OIS. I hope that you'll tell me more."

Jamie's form visibly twitches at the mention, her hands clench, the needle pods flexing on her arms as she speaks, "The OIS seems to have intercepted the artifacts that we found on our first dig that WE arranged to have sold to a private bidder. The artifacts wern't dangerous enough to warrant this arrest, and I suspect that this is a cover for interference in FUTILE OCTIVE. That or they needed the information on them for some reason." She looks at the door, then back at Vreta, "More pressingly, and urgently, it is reasonable to suspect that we will be their next targets. We won't get along with the OIS much."

Vreta takes this in calmly. "I see," he says finally. "Plant some recovered archaeological relics of legitimate occult significance, label them as dangerous, arrest the parties you wanted to arrest with a convenient pretext.... Such things have been done before."

Jamie nods. This seems like the sum total of the OIS' playbook to her.

Jamie looks back at Vreta, "I seek permission to brief the rest of the crew here about this. We need to be prepared, and they should know what's going on. Sir." Her arsm start to move at their sides, eyes glancing around the room.

Vreta considers this, hands still clasped before him. "Get the go-ahead from Frost first," he says finally. "Use him as your liaison to whoever you need. He has plenty of pull if he remembers to use it."

Jamie nods at Vreta. "Thank you Sir." She says, it almost sounds painful being pulled from her mouth. "I must.. go now." She manages, and turns away.
