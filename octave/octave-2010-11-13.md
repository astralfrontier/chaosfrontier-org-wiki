The man sitting at the desk has a natural air of authority. Even while orchestrating a disaster, he seems in command of himself and his responsibilities. Special agent Schroeder remains nearby, waiting for orders.

Finally a call comes in. The man answers. "Huxley here. ... Yes, go ahead." He beams at Shroeder. "Good work, by the way." He presses a button and begins speaking into the air, dictating a message for immediate delivery.

"To all OIS personnel. New orders. Capture and incarceration of Starkweather Solutions personnel top priority. Arrest all personnel associated with the Ashcroft Foundation's work on FUTILE OCTAVE. Charges may be fabricated per Special Order 23. Detain all military or government personnel associated with the project. Personnel list to be attached." Huxley manipulates data on his computer.

"Sir, isn't that a bit much?" Schroeder ventures. "We're not even sure--"

Huxley shows off more of his winning smile as he cuts the agent off. "You're a good cop, Schroeder. You're just what this organization has needed." A shot is fired. Schroeder staggers for a moment, putting his hands to his torso in disbelief. The hidden gun retracts itself back into Huxley's desk, and the man himself clasps his hands together. "We're past that now, of course. I hope your god promised you eternal life. Mine did."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "no, that's just on camera"

> (OOC) Jamie says, "OK"

Promised reinforcements are not long in coming. Much before that, though, Jamie's mental contact has a warning for her: _Tell your people that some dhohanoids may be freed during the attack and to protect themselves accordingly._

> (OOC) FallGM says, "You have a couple possible defenses. You can hide in some empty pods. Nathan can also try erecting an anti-dho ward."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "if you think of something else, do that instead."

> (OOC) Nathan says, "These solutions can work together, although if we're gonna keep Dale around we'll need to do something about him if we use the anti-dho ward."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "talk about it ICly"

> (OOC) Nathan will start

Jamie calls from in her current Cell, "We're probably going to have company. Also, they'll probably start freeing Dhohanoids. Or at least, other ones." Her voice is still dark as midnight, and sounds uncomfortable.

> (OOC) Jamie put in the relay of info.

Nathan rubs his chin as Jamie briefs her companions. "Well, I can erect a ward against dhohanoids. That'll help to a certain extent - though there's a practical consideration." He glances at Dale. "We'll need a different way to keep your brother protected. Or possibly isolated. If he's inside the perimeter, I can't erect the wards."

Dale pauses. "Dhohanoid internecine strife computed at 0%. I can safely remain outside without difficulty. To heighten the deception, recommendation is that I menace your group from that position," he states flatly.

Nathan purses his lips. But he _admitted_ to being a dhohanoid when asked. "Just to confirm, Dale - you _won't_ align with the other dhohanoids?"

Jamie pauses as she thinks about this, "Well, the field isn't going to protect from everyone, clearly." She starts to peek her head down the hallway, but then thinks better of it, "Just make sure you don't get yourself hurt in the process please, brother." She states, flatly, her voice not carrying must emotion at all.

Again Dale replies in his monotone. "I have no existing mission parameters involving dhohanoid cooperation." But his human voice reasserts itself. "I won't leave sis."

"Fair enough," Nathan says, still sounding skeptical. "Like your sister said, take care of yourself, okay?" He stands up straight, entering a light trance to bring the relevant grimoires to recall. "Wish I had some chalk."

Jamie calls back to Nathan, "I will probably have to join you back there eventually. You should probably let me know when everyone is .. prepared."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "okay. Nathan's rolling a pose out"

> (OOC) Jamie nodnods.

For all his academic talent, Nathan has never been entirely comfortable with the fact that sorcery so often involves pitting one inhuman force against another. But the fact of the matter is that there's little choice - humans themselves are so very weak in the _direct_ application of sorcerous energy. It is little comfort that Nathan now knows why that is.

Still, knowledge is power - and in this case, the knowledge that for all their immense power, the Great Ones are constrained in what they _will_ do. And a skilled sorcerer, with the right sigils and the right incantations, can exploit that knowledge. In this case, the greatest difficulty is in actually drawing sigils - but there is a solution at hand.

The remains of the dismantled stasis-deactivation trap includes an access panel. With sharp edges. Nathan does not dare use very _much_ blood, especially given the circumstances, but there is little other choice - and a fingertip cut ensures that only the very smallest amount of 'ink' is used to trace the wards.

> (OOC) FallGM says, "Roll ritual magic at -3"

> (OOC) DeGroot has connected.

> (OOC) Nathan rolls 3d6 for 7 (4 2 1) vs. 11, succeeding by 4

> (OOC) FallGM says, "ward is set up."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "Jamie, gimme incoming Tagers from Eldritch Society. go nuts."

> (OOC) Jamie says, "THey comin from the front door?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "yah. with explosives."

> (OOC) Jamie says, "Oh hot"

The reddish-brown smear forms the last part of the pentagram, and Nathan begins the intoned paean to Yog-Sothoth. The guttural syllables of Aramaic ring through the sterile halls of the OIS prison, and the texture of the air changes, ever so subtly. It is not a hospitable environment to humans - but it is now impassable to dhohanoids. Up to a point.

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "So uh. We hide?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "yah. Nathan's got a ward up."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "you hang out behind that"

When Nathan is done laying out the wards, Jamie gets another message _Jamie Solak? We're going to blast our way in. You should probably stay back._

As Jamie hears this, a fierce knocking is heard at the door. "DUCK AND CLEAR!" A voice, familiar with this kind of command. Some clanging is heard, and then a single, solitary beep goes off as the device gets ready to breech the door. In everyone's mind you can almost heard the countdown as it happens.

3.. 2.. 1...

As the last beep does off, the entire wing is filled with a frightening, explosive sound, the heavy steel door is literally blown off of it's hinges, and is sent flying down the corridor, ricocheting off of a wall, and blaring sparks off of the floor. It sparks and skits it's way down, stopping just inches from the wards that Nathan has set up.

As the blast settles, a team of Tagers piles in the door. THe lead a pulsing, writhing mass of tissue and flesh, looking around _Jamie?_ as they enter the door, storming into the wing.

"The attack is right behind us." The lead gnarls out as they storm in the door, his voice sounding like what one might expect from an animal, sharp and guttural. "We'll have company at any moment."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "fantastic so far. got more?"

> (OOC) Jamie says, "That's all from me unless you have something else you want me to add?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "k, I'm on it."

The creatures aren't even remotely human. What distinguishes the sight is the _variety_ of horrors present. Distended limbs, multiple eyes, things which bear only a passing and superficial resemblance to living organs or textured flesh - all this and more are present.

They are armed, without exception, sometimes wielding multiple rifles in the two or four or six arms they have, or perhaps the more flexible appendages possessed by some. They move with a purpose and an organization, but the effect is not one of a disciplined unit of soldiers. It is a seething ocean which defiles all that it touches.

And here in this place they are the masters of their enemies. They don't even try to unlock the pods. They simply destroy them, using explosive charges, multiple rifle rounds, grenades, or in some cases raw physical force.

Several dhohanoids have already escaped from their own damaged pods; these are scythed down without remorse or hesitation.

> (OOC) Jamie says, "Oh hey. That's..."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "At this point someone's gonna take a shot at Dale. What do you do about this?"

> (OOC) Jamie says, "Fun. n.n"

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "The Flying Circus?"

> (OOC) Jamie says, "Stop it.. I can pose."

> (OOC) Nathan says, "Standing by to roll Fright Check. n.n It's not like Nathan would be doing anything more in this scene anyway - I just hope the tagers brought some spare laundry is all."

Dale is not left out of this, as many identify him as such, someone, having just taken down a dhohanoid which swipes across his side, sets his sites on Dale. Jamie runs beside her brother as the Tager lays an hand across Dale, laying the boy out on the floor. "HEY! That's my brother, man. Hands off!" She glares, staring at the other Tager, still in her dark, shadowed form.

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "I will pick up any dropped weapons with a recognizable trigger. Otherwise, I do not look into shitstorm with remaining eye."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "fright checks all around. -12"

> (OOC) Jamie too?

As the inhuman monstronsities roll past, leaving the severed and demolished remains of the _other_ inhuman monstrosities in their wake, Nathan cowers behind his wards... with a smile quirking his lips. "Well... thank goodness for that then," he murmurs, his eyes twinkling as he nods in Dale's direction.

---

By the time Sasha and DeGroot regain consciousness, the Tagers have resumed human form. The crew is aboard a high-speed flying craft, a gravity van or some sort of cargo hauler, and a squad of Tagers - mercifully in human form - are armed and guarding them. Dale is under heavy guard, and watched warily by those that aren't involved in driving, but nobody has taken hostile action. Yet.

"We're out in the open," one of them remarks gruffly to Jamie. "Nobody told you about this. But you should all know." There's a second Migou hive ship on its way to Earth now."

Jamie looks back at the Tager, having positioned herself as close to Dale as she possibly can get. "So, it really is happening, isn't it?" She shakes her head.

"Oh, Hell," DeGroot mutters. He's barely regained consciousness; he doesn't bother to get up off the floor. "Then the NEG knows it's over. It's just working out who gets to die last."

"People will die if this gets out. People will commit suicide just because of the news," the Tager operative replies.

Nathan, for his part turns pale. Then he speaks. "Well, there's no choice, then," he says with a quavering voice. "We need to find the rest of the sites, and fast. The only way humanity is going to get out of _this_ one is to flee."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "this is basically conversation for you guys. let me know when you want to move on, or ask the tagers anything."

Jamie looks at Nathan, "So FUTILE OCTIVE? That's what this is all about? ANd even if we can leave... where are we going?"

"We have to get Singer, then," DeGroot says. "An Lisa, and the _Moore_ crew, for preference, if the OIS hasn't already buried them in another deep hole."

Nathan nods. "Jamie, can you ask your friends to get in touch with Armitage and company? If the OIS hasn't buried them yet, they're probably on the way. You know better than anyone how OIS handles guilt-by-association."

Sasha has come round, and starts to consult his PCPU. "So.... there's a warrant out. For all of you," he says quietly. "Facilitating a prison break from the OIS."

Jamie nods at Sasha, "Clearly. But, in all honestly, does that even matter?" She shrugs, and wraps an arm around her brother. "Just means we should like, avoid the police station for a while."

"We can hardly deny it, can we," Nathan says quietly. "What are we going to say? The OIS set us up? It's not like anyone would believe us, even if they bothered to ask."

"Typical," DeGroot mutters. "And the rest of Starkweather? How far up is it going?"

The GIA man looks closer. "All of Starkweather. Probably people in the Ashcroft Foundation too."

"Well, at least they have plausable deniability. But honestly, that's not signifigantly different than when we started." She looks at Sasha, "I think we were wanted before this. Something about stealing magic artifacts..."

Jamie looks up at the Tager that initially spoke, "So, how long do we have until the second ship gets here?"

"Don't know," the operative answers gruffly. "Triangulation from another astronomical source hasn't come in yet - or our sources didn't hear of it. Transit from Pluto is estimated at 3-5 days, though."

DeGroot looks hard at Sasha. "They'll be after you, too. You know how deep we're all in. We can invoke FUTILE OCTAVE ourselves, or die trying. What's our best chance for resuming the dig?"

Sasha shrugs. "Pirate a ship, outrun the Migou patrols?" he guesses aloud. "Official sources are out of the question."

Jamie shrugs, "Who do we need? Where's Lisa?" She asks, and looks back up at the Tagers, "Any official reaction yet? I mean official from us, that is."

Sasha smiles at that. "Well, anyone in a position to speak for Starkweather will be under arrest by now..." He taps his chin. "If you have colleagues, we can try to track 'em down, maybe intercept the OIS..."

Jamie shrugs, "Lisa doesn't seem like the sort to get captured easily. Besides, we've already almost survived one hostage rescue."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "anything else for now?"

> (OOC) Nathan doesn't have any ideas...

> (OOC) Nathan says, "just a brief pose."

DeGroot says, "Our odds will be a lot better with Lisa, Armitage, and Singer. I'd prefer the whole ship and crew.. but we need at least one shuttle with a Sifter. Can we at least get a position on those four things?"

> (OOC) Jamie says, "Do we have a plan, though?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "the list of possible plans is rapidly shrinking"

Nathan nods. "We _need_ Armitage. He's our link to the other sites. And... if I've read between the lines, he'll be better than usual at not being arrested. But we'd better hurry. Even he can't dodge the OIS forever."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "okay. moving on at this point."

---

The Eldritch Society's units have fanned out across Chicago, trying to capture high-value Starkweather or Ashcroft targets before the OIS does. The call comes back to the _Moore_'s surviving crew that two such targets have been found, and the grav-van changes course.

The craft lands to the sight of half a dozen armed men in security vests, standing outside the smoking ruins of a building that has suffered a heavy assault.

"One survivor," announces a security man as the crew disembark. He leads the way inside the rubble, where a few wounded men in the same armor are being treated by their fellows.

Jamie looks about, "The OIS did this? Of course, what am I saying, I shouldn't be surprised..."

Beyond them, Lisa Lazarus is cradling the bloodied body of Dr. Armitage in her arms. He's entirely motionless; some bandaging was started, but it's clear from its incomplete status that Armitage is well beyond first aid.

Lisa looks up as the crew approaches, and speaks - but Lisa does not normally speak with a British accent, nor with the measured assurance of age. "Nathan. DeGroot. Jamie. I'm afraid I've let you down."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "reactions welcome"

Jamie raises an eyebrow as she hears Lisa's voice. She tries to put it out of her mind, and looks down, "I'm not exactly sure how any series of events can be constructed where you have let us down..." She starts.

> (OOC) DeGroot comments

Nathan sags to his knees. "We're doomed..." he begins, seeing Armitage's body - and then stops when Lisa speaks. "A...Armitage?"

DeGroot nods, once. <i>Somehow this doesn't surprise me.</i> "Looks like we didn't do so well for you either, chum. But I think we still need you to tell us where to go."

"You have me for three days," Lisa announces. "After that, either Lisa Lazarus goes, or I do. She .. she absorbed my ego, as a last-minute act. I'm afraid it's killing her, and rather more quickly than I'd like."

"Well, that's fortunate," Nathan says, and his ghastly rictus was probably meant to be a grin. "That's about how long we have until the second hive-ship arrives."

Jamie perks up, "Well, Three days might be more than anyone needs, anyway."

> (OOC) Nathan says, "Jinx"

Lisa nods. "Yes, well." She clears her throat. "Nathan, I'm afraid I'm going to lay rather a burden on you. Since I'm gone, I'm naming you the new Dr. Armitage. It's something of a code name, you see - I wasn't the first and I won't be the last. In your duties you will be called upon to pass this along in time."

> (OOC) Nathan says, "I disagree. I'd make a lousy Dread Pirate Roberts."

> (OOC) Jamie says, "Just do what Whestley did. Find some other poor schmuck."

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "The King is dead. Long live the King."

"Um. Wow," Nathan says. It's been a long day, and it doesn't look like it's anywhere near over yet. "Well... I'm not sure I'm qualified, sir, but I'll do my best."

"Right. I think it's time we evacuate." Lisa looks about. "I can't really feel it so I'm not sure if Lisa's wounded. Helps us out, there's a sport."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "anything else for now? if not, we'll jump yet again"

> (OOC) Jamie has nothing of substance

> (OOC) FallGM says, "k. rl conversation here"

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "My proposed plan, such as it is, is this:"

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "We take who we have. We leave Singer to his moosey fate."

> (OOC) Jamie says, "Why Wouldn't we leave singer?"

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "We will need a sifter. I'm asking Latham if he can jury-rig one from a-pods in 12 hours or less."

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "Otherwise, we need to weigh the odds of stealing one. If we can't have either we fly from site to site and do the best we can with conventional earth-moving strategies..."

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "But considering how buried everything has been, it might just be pissing in the wind if it comes to that."

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "As to why we'd want Singer handy..."

> (OOC) Nathan says, "Well, you wouldn't need Nathan along if you want to try to steal a sifter anyway. So he might as /well/ try to hack one together from stone knives and bearskins."

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "1) he can see things we can't 2) he already knows half the stuff w'll have to find out 3) The migou won't shoot at him."

> (OOC) Nathan says, "The question is, do we have any of the control algorithms?"

> (OOC) Nathan says, "That's as much a part of the sifter as the hardware. Nathan can reproduce that too, but doing it from scratch /will/ take time we don't have."

> (OOC) DeGroot says, "odds are it's in a Starkweather computer. I would think any pcpus or databses from the /moore/ have been impounded. But that doesn't mean inaccessible.."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "alright."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "we're about to wrap up. Plan is in log for reference & planning."

The Tagers have one more piece of news. As Lisa limps back to the grav-van, the operative they spoke to before. "Some NEG captain wants to talk to you," he announces.

The call comes in. "Orders have come in, gentlemen. The orders are, frankly, bullshit. The _Dreadnought_ is at your disposal, ladies and gentlemen."
