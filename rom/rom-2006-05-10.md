The True tale of Ryushi begins in the land of the Jungle Tribes, terrible men so like beasts that stories of them can barely be credited. His duty is to guard the Scavenger Lord Balas through yet another nameless tomb of some long dethroned Prince of the Earth. The perils of this journey appear at first not all that different, so that when the sun rises on the 5th day of Ascending Fire, and the party readies their gear, there is wariness, but also a confidence that they shall see the light of another day.

Their path is guided by a lesser spirit named Drolm, a foul, stunted creature with a beard of lichen that drags about its ankles. Like most near these tombs, it asserts that it was once far greater, demanding the respect of all those that could be seen from the Pyramid of Zallak'ta. Of this pyramid and the great city that bore its name the spirit raves of constantly. Moonsilver pools and columns of jade, and night vigils during which the tales of the stars were read, dispelling fear of the darkness, all these things and more Drolm claims.

And yet as the party draws closer to the ruins of Zallak'ta, there is little sign at all. The jungle is thick, forming a barrier that exhausts the men as they carve their way at the urging of their guide. A growing fervor is in his eyes as the party draws near. Yet there is no sign that men can see of their progress. Rain Wind, the sharp eyed rear guard, whistles three sharp notes. Progress or no, they know now that they are being followed. Hunters of a jungle tribe have found them.

The last mile to the jewel city of Zallak'ta are a jumble in the mind. There are signs of ruins that catch only the corner of the eye. Great pillars crowned with faces that now seem pained, their mouths gaping and eyes bulging. Past these Drolm rushes onward. "They will not follow us! Not there! They fear the whispers of Zallak'ta!" screeches the lesser spirit.

Yet the hunters come on faster, and two more sets of whistles mix with the whipping of branches and shuddering of disturbed leaves. There are more bands, and they are trying to cut the scavengers off. The last desperate push to the city ends before any sign of the hunters is to be seen, but their gutteral calls ring long in the ears of those they have pursued, and crude javelins fall at the feet of Balas' party. Rain Wind is the last to reach safety, bearing several long gashes, and a long, barbed arrow has dug past the armor of her left leg, breaking skin, but fortunately only grazing her. Her lot is to wait outside, while the others continue.

Ryushi has been to many tombs and ruins, but the city of Zallak'ta is unique. It is hard to imagine any ever living here. There is an oppressive, heavy mist that hangs over the city, making the very air feel of slime and taste of rot. The jungle stands like a wall around the ruins, held at back by some force still, though the city is dead and decaying.

A long street of shattered stones leads up to what may have once been the pyramid. Now it is like a great, worn hill of stone. All about it the buildings of the city stand as silent observers. Most of the buildings still stand, though the panes of glass that once served as windows now are shivered, and a few grand halls of men are damaged to varying degrees. It is clear that this was not from neglect, but from something else. Great holes have been blasted into the structures, and some piles of rubble are marked by deep, black craters.

Balas has long made a study of the tombs of Solars, and it is he who guides the men to follow the shattered street towards the Pyramid. He seems to have no doubt that he is in the right place, now. "You can almost feel the madness of the Anathema here," mutters one of the men.

"Yes, yes, the madness. The madness that broke the very world," murmurs Drolm. Yet his words sound like one speaking in a great thirst of something sweeter than water. His dark eyes shine as he stumbles beside Ryushi, "The madness gnaws of the fallen ones gnaws at its cage here.. waiting to escape again," whispers the spirit excitedly.

There are many traps barring the way. Ryushi has seen Balas work before, but it seems this day he outdoes himself. It is not without reason. Whatever is protected here, it must be truly great. The traps are terribly cunning and viciously crude. Before the Pyramid is even reached, a rain of darts is cast down upon the scavengers from above, fired from some distant location, and a great pit opens under the feet of Ryushi, his hands finding a ledge just in time to avoid a fall into a blackness that shows no bottom.

When the time comes for Balas to open the door to the pyramid itself, there is an ominous silence, and then.. nothing. No trap, no defense, not even a challenge. "This is very bad," says Balas softly. He stands still, tilting his head, trying to hear anything that might indicate what is going on. He holds aloft a crystal and with a slight motion of his hand, causes it to burst into a brilliant light. He gasps and his words come out in a croak, "May the Dragons Protect us!"

The source of his horror is clear to those who stand near him. Though none but Balas can read the ancient letters on the wall, the images are clear enough. They depict a mad god standing at an altar bathed in blood, the altar that was once upon the very pinnacle of the pyramid. There are three long lines of people waiting on the stairs of the pyramid, and behind the mad god, a fourth line moving away. All along the pyramid there is blood, and corpses butchered, all with such detail as only a madman could create. The stink of rotting is strong in the air, and then the light is turned, so that what most horrifies Balas is clear. Along the floor below that image, a puddle of blood is growing, fed by a dripping and then a noisy rush of thick, darkening blood that spills from the image itself.

Ryushi's swords are out of their sheaths by the time the vermillion spill has despoiled another inch of the ground. He has had eight years to resolve himself to a nameless death or a worse transformation at the hands of some ancient tomb. He has been jeered at by the bodyguards of the city scholars who buy his master's goods, told that he'll come to no end. All such thoughts are long past. Whatever comes now, his mind is filled only with one thing: the song of steel.

The rasping laughter of Drolm for a time is the only sound, the spirit sounding even less sane than usual. He whispers, "Go, go, go to feed the Pyramid's fallen god!" and stares at Balas with glowing eyes. The scavenger lord is not easily put off, but there is something in this place that has overthrown his resolve. The images on the wall, the presence of blood, and the growing sense of dread, as every thread of his spirit tells him that no one should come here all convince him, "We should leave this place."

The corrupted spirit steps into the song in Ryushi's mind as his most important immediate opponent. The warrior steps back from the bleeding wall, flanking Balas, ready to commit blasphemy in the name of his patron by striking at a god.

It is too late for Balas' order. Drolm's laugher rises into a crescendo of gleeful madness, and the tunnel that leads back from the gate of the Pyramid grows suddenly dark, shutting with a drawn out groan of pure agony. The spirit's eyes focus on Ryushi's face, and the it's grin grows, the stunted form straightening, showing for just a moment what once was Drol'eem Nalash, the Maiden of Joyful Laughter, her beauty so great it was once said that to be in her presence was the closest a mortal could ever come to seeing the beauty of heaven. That vision is all too brief. With a last, terrible cackle of mad joy her form distorts, as if her skin suddenly lost all form and her insides were pressing out at random against her flesh. Then, in a burst of vomitous stench, she is gone.

The light in Balas' hand flickers, and the whole Pyramid groans again, the floor shaking wildly. There is a sound like pounding, as if something enormous was slamming against the Pyramid from below, or perhaps, a pounding like something weighted to it, struggling against its bonds. The men around Balas panic, pushing and struggling against the heavy slab that bars their way back out. Balas moves ahead, saying evenly, "The only way out is to find where that door can be reopened. There will be a way." Yet even he has a hard time maintaining his balance, and by now the pool of blood cannot be easily avoided. Only with a running leap does Balas avoid most of it, getting only one foot in the thick, viscuous fluid.

While the others succumb to their panic, Ryushi is able to cling to his purpose, the one thing that defines his very being. He is a protector, and it is Balas he serves. He leaps over the pool of blood to follow the scavenger lord, abandoning the others to the darkness. Their voices rise in screams that go on and on as Balas leads the way deeper into the tomb. Distance does not seem to lessen it, and it always sounds as if they were just out of the range of the crystal's light. Balas stops twice to call back to them, but he does not turn back when he hears their agony continuing. Instead, he leads the way down, down into the great depths of the tomb. No less than a hundred paces straight down does the first stair descend, and it is not the last, nor even the greatest that the two race down. Traps trigger about them madly, and Ryushi finds that something in him is changing, something is growing. Again and again he faces certain death and comes away without even a scratch.

Ryushi twice saves Balas from traps too subtle for the Scavenger Lord to avoid, and more and more he can feel something in the air other than the terror that fills Balas and torments the others out of sight. There is a soft song, something so familiar he must have heard it. The voices in it are impossible to make out, but their sound keeps at bay fear and despair, and he is tireless.

The mad rush ends at a door unlike any that Balas and Ryushi have ever seen. It is a delicate looking gate formed of a tin frame and paper. On it are etched mystical runes that shimmer lightly. Balas finds himself at a loss. That these are arcane formulae is obvious, yet it is beyond anything he has seen. He makes an error in his rush to understand, to escape, and does not grasp a critical fact. This is not the door to escape, but the door for that which must not be allowed to escape.

Balas breaks the seal, and air rushes past it, cold and clammy as it moves over the skin. What happens next, Ryushi will not remember, save in patches and bits of nightmare. He will forget the meeting with Zallak'ta the Great's ghost, the spirit of a Solar killed centuries ago by his Dragon Blooded servants.

Ryushi will forget becoming the pawn of Zallak'ta, and striking down the one he was meant to protect. He will not recall just how the blade Daoyang was recalled from Outside to his hand, nor how he knows its proper name. What he will not forget is a voice that came to him, like that in the song as he raced through the pyramid, protecting Balas with impossible skill. The voice that asked him if he would avenge the death of his master, and bring the radiant light of dawn to those who live in dark places. He will not forget that he said yes.

Ryushi stumbles out of the tomb, words of power echoing from his lips in a tongue that was old when the stars were young. The tomb's less willful defenses subside in deference, and the warrior duly forgets what he has said. The robe of the Auspicious Eight Brothers is drenched in blood and mud. His hands are slick with blood and sweat. His feet leave crimson stains as they cross the forgotten stones of the courtyard.

What he finds is silence and death. The savages who pursued them have long since departed. Their lives are simple, but they are wise in their way. For did they not avoid the inhuman fate which has claimed all but two of the unwary expedition?

Two, for Ryushi is not alone. Rain Wind has survived. She is bleeding, but is versed enough in herbs and remedies to carry the correct drugs to stave off infection and blood-loss. In a broken voice, too weary even to express her surprise at seeing him alive, she directs Ryushi in the tending of her tortured body's worst wounds. Then dreams and fever come for her, and she too falls silent. Ryushi kneels beside her, cradling her as the rain begins to fall. Heaven must weep, for the nascent Solar cannot.

The swordsman walks mechanically through the trees, carrying his companion. He does not know for how long. Nestled in his pocket is a bloodstained lock of Balas' hair. He does not remember when or how he took it, nor does he know the meaning of the bloody rune carved into his left palm. Nor does he know of the name - _Daoyang_ - which sings the song of steel in his mind.

Night falls, and Ryushi reaches the tents of the Auspicious Eight Brothers' encampment. The few men who stayed behind while the tomb-robbers went forth rush out, babbling their useless questions and making their pointless observations. Their words wash over Ryushi. He surrenders his companion to the savant-physician Ahiru, then finds a cot and simply falls into sleep.

When Ryushi's gaping wounds and bloodied body were discovered to be healed flawlessly after only a night of sleep, Rain Wind quietly told him to leave over breakfast. She shed tears that he alone could see, and he nodded quietly. He told her what he knew, what had happened, and gave her the lock of hair. Then he took his swords, armor, and pack, and left.

He traveled, feeling something in him stirring, a drive to move. He found the Mighty Yanaze, the great river, and slept on its bank for one night. And during the night he had a dream.

_The beach is sunny and beautiful; it is the Season of Fire, and the wind blows at just the right speed to be soothing without cooling. The sand on the beach sparkles with a crystalline elegance. The sea is flawless blue, richly textured. Overhead, the clouds dance in stately elegance as the sky-dragons cavort through their slow-motion games._

_The girl is smiling as she looks out across the waters. She is facing west, toward the Uttermost West. Her brown hair is teased by the breeze, except for the braided strand which rests on her left shoulder. She is standing to his right, and she sighs in contented happiness. She turns. Her eyes can be seen, but their color is uncertain in the dream. She opens her mouth. She is going to speak. She.._

Ryushi finds himself at the point of a bandit's sword. He is waking. He is sleeping on the bank of the Yanaze. Two other men stand by him, chortling at his misfortune.

The bandit is startled. He thought to kill a sleeping stranger. He does not see Ryushi's sword in his hand. He is fortunate; he loses only his leg, beneath the knee. Ryu rises.

The blood sprays across the hard-packed soil of the riverbank. Ryu's shorter weapon cuts across the sternum of another, and he falls with a gurgled expresson of surprise. The third raises his machete, and loses the arm at the shoulder.

The warrior has said nothing. He looks at his three would-be killers with empty eyes. _Why are they doing this?_ is his first conscious thought. _Why do they offend the Dragons?_ The two survivors do not question. Between screams, they assist each other in fleeing as quickly as possible. Ryushi attends to the burial of the third, speaking a short prayer to calm his ghost before chucking his body into the Yanaze as an offering to the predators who swim there.

He feels at his forehead. There is something warm there. Kneeling before the river, he looks at his wave-distorted reflection. He sees something which Balas and the other Eight Brothers often revealed in moments of times of stress, tension, or battle. He has a Caste Mark. It is shining like the dawn of the Sun, which only now is rising to bathe the world in its light.
