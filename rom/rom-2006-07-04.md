Exiled by the Exaltation, and abandoned by his comrades, Ryushi has nothing to hold him now but his dreams - and the sword Daoyang. The wave-like motifs which adorn its golden hilt can be no coincidence, since his dreams have become more and more dominated by the presence of islands and ocean. He is being called to the West.

He books passage on one of the Realm's cargo vessels, which travels between the satrapies of the Inner Sea's coastline and Harborhead under the watchful eye of the Lookshy Navy. He possessed enough baubles and trinkets from his life under the tutelage of a Scavenger Lord to at least be allowed to ride on board. Food is scarce, and Ryushi realizes he will need work nearly immediately after debarking.

The sea voyage is long and relatively uneventful. Ryushi is present when Keeper of Waves, the god-blooded child of a Storm Mother, alights on the ship's deck from a sudden tsunami-like wave and demands right of inspection. The youth's aquamarine eyes fix the Solar with a piercing stare as he completes his inspection of the boat and its contents, but neither the half-god nor his matron say anything. The vessel sails on.

---

In the city of Harborhead, a new Solar's dreams are far from restive. Through the night Tanuki sees scraps of shadowed faces. He hears many names, but they like foreign words they prove too elusive for memory to capture. There is one simularity between them all. Skin color changes, the origin of the names changes, even genders shift, but there is one thing they all bear: a glowing loop of pure luminance on their brows.

'Who are you?' "You as you were." "You as you are." "You as you must be." The words ring through Tanuki's mind, and it is like trying to listen to a hundred different voices all talking at once, and then, silence. He feels himself floating in a golden light, and though when he looks down there is nothing under his feet but open air, he is calm. The source of the golden light is straight above him, and when he looks up to the glowing disc of the sun, he need no blink, nor even squint. It is like this that Tanuki finds himself suddenly awake, staring to the east, seeing the last moments of dark just before the sun climbs the horizon.

Tanuki stretches sleepily. He has just enough time to wonder what happened to his blankets, when the sound of a snore startles him, and he sits up hurriedly, knife already in his hand. He relaxes a bit when he realizes that it's Meggan, still fast asleep with her kitty snuggled up in her hair. "Huh..." he says to himself, rubbing his forehead unthinkingly. "Now why'd I go an' drag her all the way over here?" he asks himself - a question he'd been asking himself ever since he'd arrived 'home' with her, even though he knows some of the answer, deep in his heart.

Standing up, he makes his way around a pile of blankets to the spot where he keeps his mirror. "An' what in the hell was that dream all 'bout?" he mutters to himself as he raises his knife to his chin to shave... and nearly cuts his own throat when he gets a good look at his reflection in the mirror. "Wh...what in the..." he murmurs, pop-eyed in wonder as he reaches out to his own reflection, and then to the golden circle still visible on his forehead. "Well, I'll be damned..." he says softly.

Tanuki doesn't remember too many of the stories, but he's overheard enough Immaculate sermons whilst pilfering the cloakroom, and he knows what the symbol means... or what it's supposed to mean. But this is the same Immaculate philosophy which suggested that as a slave, he's supposed to be inferior to his masters, and he's quite clear in his mind as to where the Immaculates can stuff _that_ idea. "So why can't they be wrong about this too?" he says to himself. Besides... that dream was clear. It was no demons that spoke to him in his sleep... he knew them far too well, even without knowing how he knew. And now... he understands a little more of what they're talking about.

As he comes out from behind the crates, thoughts of shaving all but forgotten, he sees Meggan again, and chuckles to himself. _Being one o' them "Anathema" can't hardly get me in more trouble than this,_ he thinks. _And... I can't take her back, even if I had the chance. I can't do that to her, unless she decides she wants to. Least now I have some idea how I managed to **get** her outta there last night..._ With that, he settles down beside Meggan, waiting for her to awaken. _Gods, she's beautiful._

Meggan sighs softly in her sleep. Even sleeping, she seems to be smiling still. She covers her mouth as she yawns, her eyes opening just a little. By rote, she reaches up to pick up kitty from her hair and settles the cat (which mews plaintively upon being disturbed) in her lap for his morning petting, which quiets his pouting quite quickly. She listens intently for a moment, then asks, "Are you there?"

"I'm still here," Tanuki responds. "Did you sleep well?" She can't have - he feels certain. If she's used to big soft mattresses, sleeping on a hard floor with nothing but a few old blankets for cushioning should have left her stiff as a board. But she seems happy enough...

Yet she isn't. She rises rather smoothly, though she doesn't take more than a step. She remembers that she's far from the ground. "I had such good dreams. I don't know if I was more eager to stay asleep to go on dreaming, or to wake up and see what the day would bring." Meggan asks curiously, "You know, I do have a question. If you have no cook or a kitchen, where do you get your food from? I think both of us could use a breakfast. I think kitty could use a little water, as well. Someone got a mouse in the night!" To her, everything is exciting.

Tanuki chuckles softly. "I don't usually keep much food round here - goes bad too fast. I think I have a little jerky round here..." he says, getting up and rummaging in a crate. "Blast! Used up the last last night. Guess I'll have to go get some more," he says, and chuckles. There's certainly no pretense of _buying_ anything as trivial to steal as food. "You and kitty wait right here... I'll getcha some food and water. Might be kinda poorer fare than what y're used to, but it'll stop ya from bein' hungry."

Meggan carefully sits herself down and nods. "I'll just sit right here, then." She looks back towards the place that was her home, "Father probably has a lot of men out looking for me. Staying out of sight is for the best." She smiles warmly, "Besides, I like it here."

With that, Tanuki is away across the rooftops. Even if he had had some food left over, he'd probably have gone out anyway, for himself if nothing else... a morning burgle always gets his blood flowing, gets the day started right. _This time of mornin', best bet is prob'ly the docks. Should be plenty to sneak off the boats, an' maybe I can get a little somethin' extra off the passengers._

Tanuki pauses in flight to tear off a strip of his shirt and tie it around his forehead. _Don't want people gettin' funny ideas,_ he thinks to himself.

At the docks, Tanuki's usual sources are prepared. Keeper of Waves, the god-blooded child of a spirit of the Inner Sea, habitually informs his allies in Harborhead of 'interesting' passengers and cargo. One of these allies has an apprentice thaumaturge with a loose tongue and a taste for jade; through him, Tanuki has never lacked for ideas on whom to rob.

Tanuki's conversation with the lad is brief, but fruitful. Food can wait; if someone aboard this vessel is carrying something like that... His first thoughts are of profit and risk, but they are quickly overtaken by another thought. _If someone is carrying artifacts like that... well, if I'm going to last long as one of them Anathema, it mightn't be a bad idea to find someone else who's got the same problem. And... if he ain't, then that whatever-it-is would be something I'd get more use out of than he would._ As always with Tanuki, the idea that he has more need of something than another man is all the reason he needs to take it, if he can. He makes his way to the docks, the description fresh in his mind.

Ryushi comes down the gangplank. Fine-featured, black hair drawn back into a queue, with two swords thrust into his belt, he is the picture of an Eastern warrior. But he is clearly new to the South.

And that's just how Tanuki likes 'em. _I'm sure they have pickpockets where you come from, mister... but do you have 'em as good as we are?_ He lurks in the crowd until he can shadow Ryushi, slipping closer and closer. He bides his time, waiting until there's an appropriate distraction... taking the time to look Ryushi over for whatever 'wonders' he might be carrying.

Though he hides it well, the warrior is wearing golden bracers on his forearms. The glint of light reveals itself to Tanuki as the warrior strides over the adamant-glass tiles connecting the dock to the rest of Harborhead, mutual reflections giving him away.

_Hm... that'd be hard to burgle,_ thinks Tanuki to himself. _Ah well, plan B. I'll get his attention, then lead him off somewhere. If he can keep up... he's one o' me, an' we can talk. If he can't... then I just double back to wherever 'e stopped an' give 'im a nice quiet sleep._ With that, he creeps closer, prepared to slit the man's purse with just the right amount of subtlety to make sure no one but the Easterner notices.

Tanuki is briefly disappointed when nothing but a few yen emerge, but then, stealing the coins isn't the point of the exercise. Ryushi feels the faint tugging at his belt, and turns around just in time to see a short and scruffy peasant-like man concealing a few glinting coins in a pocket. Tanuki tugs the edge of Ryushi's sleeve, revealing the glint of gold for the briefest of moments. Giving Ryushi a brief wink, the Trickster is just as quick to take to his heels, darting through the crowd with practiced ease.

Frowning, and knowing he's being played, Ryu darts off after him, one heavy footfall after another. The big man's hand is on his sword-hilt, but he isn't drawing - not yet.

Grinning broadly, Tanuki emerges from the market crowd near a back alley and vaults over an overturned crate, perches on a rainwater barrel, and shinnies up the drainpipe with practiced ease. Halfway up, he leaps across to the roof of a single-story building, runs across it, and drops down into the next alley. This stranger was pretty fast out of the gate, and had gotten closer behind Tanuki than he'd liked... let him go round the long way, thinks Tanuki. No need to put himself too much at risk.

These thoughts are interrupted by the sound of cracking adobe, as the wall of the alley is smashed through. A water-barrel comes bowling through the gap, breaking into splinters in the last moments of its life as a weapon. Ryushi vaults through the gap, tucked into a tight ball as he tumbles. He lands catlike, on both feet and propped up by one hand, eyes fixed on Tanuki.

_Hey, you're good!_ thinks Tanuki in exultation and trepidation combined, and spares the man a grin over his shoulder before darting into another narrow cul-de-sac. This time, when he springs onto the wall in one graceful leap, he knows better than to just jump down the other side, but instead turns left and uses the six-inch ledge of the adjoining building, running along it just as if it were a two-cart thoroughfare. His course takes them away from the well-maintained and freshly painted buildings of the commercial district and into increasingly unkempt and tumbledown slums - Tanuki's home.

Behind him, Ryushi's mastery of Essence permits him the same feat. Kicking off the wall, he ascends to the ledge to give chase, looking increasingly upset.

Tanuki has not mastered his Essence yet - it having only awakened last night - but the fact that this big man is following _this_ path tells Tanuki that at least this isn't some ordinary schmuck with fancy wristbands. Now... he leaps off the building, vaulting over a wall, catching a clothesline in one hand - his momentum rips the string loose from its mooring, and Tanuki swings into the adjoining alley. Letting go, he perches on a window ledge, and waits for the few moments it'll take the man to follow him, before tossing the pilfered coins into the dirt at his feet when he comes round the corner. "Hey you!"

Ryushi dashes forward, catching one of his coins on the tips of his boot. He kicks it up in the next footfall, punching forward with a fist. It sends the coin spinning like a sling-stone at Tanuki.

The projectile is fast - impossibly fast. Tanuki is faster... but not by much. He leaps out of the way just as the coin embeds itself in the moldy plaster of the building behind him, and lands in a crouch on the alley floor. "All right, all right, ya made yer point, ya big oaf," says Tanuki, ripping off the makeshift headband. The symbol of Night still glows on his forehead - his headlong flight having rekindled it slightly. "I had ta get ya away from the market so's I could talk to ya, okay?"

Ryushi stops and stares at Tanuki, eyes narrowed. This is something new to his experience. Although he was ostracized for his own Solar status, he is not at all certain how he should react to another of "his kind" - whatever kind that may be. At last he decides. His hand looses from the handle of his weapon, but does not yet leave it. "What do you want?" he asks.

Tanuki's hackles settle a bit, and he shrugs. "I just wanted ta find out what this is all about," he says, indicating his forehead. "An' I figured I can't talk about somethin' like that with just anybody. So I thought I'd find someone else who wuz the same, maybe get ta know him. Ya know? Mebbe I can help ya, too. Anythin' ya lookin for in this town? I could prob'ly hook ya up."

"I need to go West," Ryushi answers, plainly. "I need to find work to pay for passage."

"Work, eh?" Tanuki says, laughing a little - evidently the lad finds the concept mildly amusing. "Well, what kinda work? I figger ya're prob'ly good for strong-arm kinda work," he says, nodding to the weapons, "but mebbe ye'd rather somethin' else. Or if muscle _is_ yer game..." He rubs his chin, bristles scraping. "I wunner if ol' Sparky's got any ex-pee-ditions planned," he murmurs to himself, using the nickname of the Scavenger Lord he knows in town. His fence could probably line up any number of hitting-people-and-breaking-things kind of jobs, but he's not quite as comfortable dealing with the man. Sometimes such jobs result in hitting people Tanuki doesn't think ought to get hit, and especially oughtn't be hit by someone who can hit as hard as this Solar evidently can.

"Right now I'm not particular," answers Ryushi in a level tone. "Your name?"

"They call me Tanuki," responds the Trickster. "An' you?"

"Ryushi." The warrior finally lets go of his sword and tilts his head, cracking the bones of his neck. "You have a place to stay, it sounds like. Lead me to it, and we'll talk more."

Tanuki hesitates for a moment, rubbing his chin again. "Well..." he says reluctantly, remembering that his hideout currently contains a kidnapped girl, even if it was with her cooperation. But this reminds him that it's presently a _hungry_ kidnapped girl. "Eh, what the hell. Could ya wait here a moment first? I need to get some breakfast fer me an' a friend..."

Tanuki changes his mind. Ryushi looks tough enough, but could he stand against a whole gang? _Maybe... but why make him risk it?_ thinks Tanuki to himself. "Actually... tell ya what, I'll take ya there now, an' then go get breakfast for all o' us. It's on me." With that, he grins broadly - even if Ryushi is fresh off the boat, he'd have to be ten times more naive than _that_ not to realize that, in fact, breakfast will be on someone else.

The swordsman gestures, signaling his intention to follow.

Tanuki sets out. The route is roundabout - Tanuki avoids arriving at his hideout the same way twice - and makes considerable use of the rooftops. The Trickster is unsurprised by now to learn that Ryushi can keep up the pace, though at one point he does have to turn around and advise, "Uh, no, keep ta the edges - don't walk right cross the top. It's daytime - ye want to walk over the walls so's not to make as much noise."

And somewhere along the way, there's a distinct feeling of something being wrong. It's not easy to define, but it grows with each step. The feeling is one that demands it be heeded, and calls for faster and faster footsteps. At last, when Tanuki reaches the hideout, his fear is revealed clearly. Kitty lies on its side, panting heavily, its paws bloodied. Meggan is nowhere in sight. The way the few things here are scattered, it's clear she wasn't too happy to go with whoever showed up here.

"Oh bugger," Tanuki says. Ryushi is totally forgotten for the moment, as he hurriedly searches the old rooms for signs of which way the kidnappers - oh, all right, the re-kidnappers - may have went. Or for anything they may have left behind.

Ryushi's able to read the signs of a struggle, and his sword slides an inch out of its hilt within a heartbeat. "Breakfast will wait," he announces.
