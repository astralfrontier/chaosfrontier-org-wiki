After surveying the scene of Meggan's kidnapping, the exalts were able to pick up the trail. It is hardly difficult. Many of the beggars and fellow footpads saw her taken. Many stood by and watched her fight in vain against the sailors of the Blue Wind Fleet. Their reputation is one that is known throughout Harborhead and across many ports. They will deal with anyone, and sell anything. No matter how vile or cursed the cargo, they will handle it. This has given them some measure of leeway in the places they frequent. Judging from the speed at which they fled, and the number of dead guards and sailors in their wake, it seems that this leeway was not enough to justify the kidnapping of a girl of Meggan's station.

The only crews that would have the courage to move against the Blue Wind are those of Harborhead's own navy. While they have tolerated a great deal from the Blue Wind, this has pushed their limits. It will not be lightly armed merchant ships that the Blue Wind must deal with. Harborhead's most violent and hardened warriors and killers will be arrayed against them. Their navy has a reputation of being little better than pirates, but they are loyal and so long as they kill only those the King names as enemy, they will be supported. There is no question of how they will deal with the ones they hunt. Still, they are always seeking for more volunteers, and there is a call for more to join the hunt and prove themselves.

Ryushi will enlist. He has no intention of letting any of these men achieve their objective - on either side - and he is fully confident in his own power.

Although Tanuki has no problem with this plan, he'd rather not have it be known that the Trickster stooped to enlisting in the navy. Fortunately, a change of clothes, an eyepatch, an affected swaggering gait, and some devious uses of charcoal ensure that Ryushi's enlistment companion is a rough-hewn individual named Ferret.

The two men are accepted, after a few minor tests. For Ryushi, it's not hard to impress them with his strength, and Tanuki with his wit and stealth. All these things are valuable to them. They will naturally get the less pleasing jobs on the ship (swabbing the decks), but they are allowed to board, and wind up on the same ship. They can learn easily enough that four are being sent, and that the fleet against them has at least twice as many.

Ryushi speaks with Tanuki, once the pair are aboard, outlining his suggestion. "We must get aboard one of the two Terrestrial vessels," he says. "Let the fleets fight it out - speed and wind are what we need."

Tanuki nods. "The last thing we need is one of them getting to Meggan first," replies 'Ferret', and then grins. "How d'you suggest we do it? Jump?"

Ryu shakes his head. "We don't jump unless they look likely to pull away, or unless The Terrestrials are distracted. But we stay ready."

Tanuki nods, and gets back to swabbing the deck, keeping the head ships in vision as much as possible. "Don't think they'll wanna get away from support if they c'n help it, but y'never know how arrogant Exalts c'n get," he adds, grinning.

For ten days the ships travel. At the end of the second, the ship on which the Solars have ridden has its sails swell, and it seems that the exalts ahead know exactly what they wish to do. The captain gives the word for everyone to ready for battle on the morn of the tenth day. "The head ships will sweep them from the front, and we will blast them from the back," is all she offers by way of explanation. She's an older woman by appearance, with skin like sandpaper with not an ounce of fat left on her. In the short time they know her, the Solars find her extremely demanding of her crew, but no more demanding than she is of herself. There's something in her that most would find likable, if they could get past her filthy speech.

Battles at sea are usually rather distant, impersonal affairs. But for pirates who are fighting pirates, it is looking to be at a far closer range than usual. "Now remember.. we get the girl, and we keep everything else for ourselves! A bounty on every head over there!" barks the captain. This is unusual, but to the liking of the crew. Normally they have to enslave the enemy to turn a profit. Killing them is going to be far less troublesome. Having full rights on all they take is better still. A courtesy that Simeon the Fat will sponsor himself, paying the customary 50 percent privateer fee from his own coffers for this chance of vengeance.

At last, Ryushi shares part of his plan with Tanuki: intimidate the crew of the boat with a fake talisman (said to be capable of detonating the firedust belowdecks), if it becomes necessary to obtain their support; board the Blue Wave vessels, interrogate the captain, and get to the ship where Meggan is being held.

Ryushi explains his reasoning: "To get to the ships we need early enough, we'll need to uncover ourselves. The captain can be an ally if she chooses; if not, she will expose herself if she outs us."

After a little snickering, Tanuki agrees to this plan. "She's a bit old fer me, but sure," he says, grinning.

The captain is fortunately in her cabin, making some final preparations. To the Solars, the most telling of these preparations is the black mask she has ready at her desk. A mask that will cover her head almost completely. "What do you two bilge rats want?" she snaps irritably.

"We'll trade your cooperation for your secret," Ryushi says bluntly. "Your knives revealed you."

"What me good friend here means," says Tanuki, swaggering forward and grinning, "is that we gots a proposition for ya. Me friend here's got a plan that'll get ya in ahead o' everyone else an' still win. He's a lot smarter than yer average bilge rat, y'see. So'm I, at that."

"Than maybe we can all stop talking like peasants," comes the captain's response. Her manner of speech is utterly different, and her accent marks her out as well. She's from the Blessed Isle. "So you saw my girls, have you?" she says evenly, looking at Ryushi closely. "I thought you two did a bit too well for comfort, but I figured at worst I could have you killed in the battle. A pity you are observant and skilled. What is your plan? And what is it you want?"

"We want the girl safe." The swordsman shrugs. "The Blue Wave captains would know which ship she's on. If you can't read the ship they're protecting from their maneuvering during the battle, then we'll just have to get that information out of one by boarding. We're faster than anybody but those jade-wearers, and we haven't tested ourselves against.. against the Exalted."

"I have a counter proposal," replies the captain. "You can have the girl. I couldn't care less. But you must help me gain control of both fleets. I'm through serving the drooling imbeciles of Harborhead. With what we have here and what the Blue Wind has, I can do things my own way. You do this, and I'll drop you in any safe port with that girl and enough jade and silver to get you wherever you please."

Ryushi glances at Tanuki; his eyes say "yes", but he defers from speaking.

The captain turns to Tanuki, "And if you want to stay on, I could use some good hands. But first.. you must show me." She reaches up and taps on her brow. "I want proof. If you are just liars, I'll slit your throats and dump you over the side."

Tanuki smiles broadly, this time in delight rather than humor. "I like the way you think, ma'am," he says, suppressing his usual 'peasant' mode of speech. Sounds like everyone wins. Except the Blue Wind and Simeon, but who cares about them, eh?" He then sobers. "Prove ourselves, eh?" He does not bother with the pretense of asking what she means, but he hesitates nonetheless."

Ryushi's sword flashes out of its scabbard. With his first swing, the Solar sends a lime flying into the air above the captain's table; with half a dozen follow-up swings, he catches the fruit at the apex of its flight. It breaks neatly into slices, each separating to resume falling.

And before the fruit has a chance to tumble, Tanuki's hand darts into his vest and comes out holding a handful of throwing knives. With a flick of his wrist, the knives are in flight, and each one neatly skewers its own slice of lime, pinning them to the far wall of the cabin in a tight starburst pattern.

"Any fool Dynast can show a Caste Mark," offers Ryushi tersely. "Not all can fight. There is your proof."

And for her part, the Captain watches with a growing smile. It's some measure of her own power that she's able to tell that every motion of the Solars is not a threat to her. "Very well done," she says softly. "And now, I will show you what _I_ can do." She rises from her desk, "Let me show you how a ship was meant to sail."

The mask of the Captain is put on by the cabin boy, and the crew stands watching her in a way that makes it clear: they know she's not normal. They know that the Captain has a talent beyond their own. She is their confidence. "The helm is yours, Captain Wavecutter." The first mate steps aside with a knowing grin and steadies himself. Those who have been with her all look more alert, focusing on staying on their feet. Things are about to get very bumpy.

And they do. The captain barks out, "These two men will be leading the fight for us today! You will mark them as you do me. Today, we're finally going to get our due, boys!" The first mate looks suprised, but quite pleased. After all, he's likely to wind up as a captain himself before this day ends. He knows what is going on. It seems that the old hands all do.

The captain's name seems fitting. Whatever talents she has, they are enough to bring the ship to life. She can see the way her enemy has arrayed their ships. She sees what they wish to defend and are willing to lose. Against her subordinates, it's a reasonable tactic. With the sheer, impossible speed of her vessel, however, it is hopeless. She's using their own sluggish motions against them, so that their cannons are made useless, and every turn she matches, racing past their defensive line and into their center. "GET READY TO BOARD!" she roars.

When the ships get close enough, Ryushi leaps across the space, eschewing grappling lines or ropes. His paired swords leave their scabbards in the same instant, and he lands armed with twin fangs of steel.

Tanuki may not be able to jump like Ryushi, but he has his own talents. As soon as the first grapple flies across the space, he runs light-footedly along it, his arms folding across his chest as he runs and then opening wide, sending deadly slivers of steel whirring into the crowds of Blue Waves that rush toward the rail.

No less than fifty grappling hooks are thrown after Ryushi makes his prodiguous leap. The skill of Wavecutter and the grace of her ship allow the less talented men to make the traversal as well. Still, there are many held back. "Take this one! I've got to keep the mice busy!" the captain shouts out to the boarding party.

Tossing his large-and-small blades into the air, Ryushi kneels down. With a mighty bellow he drives a bare fist straight into the wood of the deck, in the path of the onrushing defenders, and his shout of rage is answered by the tortured splintering of wood.

As the deck falls away in front of him, Ryu crosses his arms, and the sword-hilts fall spinning neatly into his grasp. He crouches, extending the long blade in front of him, the shorter behind him, bladed edge down.

As Tanuki reaches the end of the rail, he leaps into the air, somersaulting, then landing with one foot on the back of Ryushi's short blade. Using this as a springboard, he leaps over the hole in the deck and toward one of the ship's ropes. A thrown knife thuds into the bollard and cuts the rope free just as Tanuki catches it; the young Night Caste swings into the air, and then twists round, hollering "Yahoooo!" as he swings down straight at the Blue Wave pirates as they try to cut the boarding ropes... feet first, at head level.

The dramatic move and supernatural talent of exalts is something most of these men have heard of. In stories. It's not something they've seen. Tanuki is able to bowl five men right over the sides and into the water below, and the rest are slammed into the men at their back. One screams as a drawn blade from behind punches through his ratty vest and buries itself in his back.

Ahead of these, men are swallowed by the wide hole that Ryushi has smashed through the decks. One particularly unlucky man is sent flying as a board is smashed free, springing him into the air and over the side. Below, the source of speed for the entire Blue Wind fleet is made clear to Ryushi. Dozens of chained men and women await the call to row below decks, and for some, this is their first sight of sun in weeks, and they flinch away from it.

Satisfied that the first wave of line-cutters has been adequately dealt with, and mindful of the prisoners below, Ryushi leaps with monkey-like grace and power over the heads of the fallen pirates, landing well in. He dashes directly for the ship's wheel, listening for a man or woman to shout orders - that is his target.

His call had been exuberant at the start of his leap, a expression of joy in movement and flight. And then Tanuki got a glimpse inside the hole as he flew over. By the time he reaches the end of his swing, his expression has changed to one of grim determination. He lets his swing carry him over the deck of the boat, twisting and spinning out of the way of the handful of archers with wit enough to fire back, and then lets go to plummet into the hole. He grimaces at the glint of chains, but now is the time to go after the slavemasters. Locks can be picked later.

By now, the pirates are pulling themselves over the deck. Despite initial appearances, these guys are efficient and organized. The best get on first and form a wall of swords. Behind them the second rank turns to pull up the third, who bring to bear heavy crossbows before they even step on deck, killing many of those that Tanuki drove back before they can even react.

Those with bows do try to aim at Tanuki, but before they can put an arrow in him, he is below decks, and out of their range. Near the wheel, but not manning the helm, a powerfully built man growls, "Shoot the others, you twits! Drive them back over, you blind hogs!" Ryushi's approach cuts him off, and he hefts a heavy blade, readying himself for combat. As if by magic, a wide area clears for this battle, and nobody looks too eager to interfere.

Below, Tanuki can see no less than three task masters. The chamber is wide, and it's not the lowest level. Something is farther down yet. The chains are held in the normal way. A shoddy lock in every row, and every man chained in place on a series of hooks.

Leaping over heads and blades, Ryushi lands right in the face of the surprised captain. His twin blades flash as he blocks and parries the suddenly flurry of steel the man offers, and he drives the captain back a step with a sudden powerful surge of energy from his sword arm - not against the man himself. Against his blade.

The blade sparkles in the light as it tumbles out into the air. Already Ryushi's blades are in position, and he stands ready to slash open the captain's throat. "Now that you've had time to think about it, are you ready to surrender?" he demands gruffly, as a distant splash marks the landing spot of the man's weapon.

The disarmed man tries to ease back a bit. "I don't think ya get it," he answers. He looks past Ryushi, towards the cabin. "There are things a man fears more'n death."

Ryushi sighs and turns away. Then he turns back in a sudden burst of speed, taking the captain out with a vicious left cross. As the unconscious body hits the deck, Ryushi stalks toward the cabin.

Belowdecks, Tanuki grins ferally at the taskmasters. It is not a nice grin at all. "So how do you gentlemen fancy a spot of rowing? No? Lemme change your mind," he says, his hand lashing out like lightning and throwing a knife past the hip of one of the slavers.

The blade cuts through the belt and the guard, utterly stunned, doesn't even move. His britches go tumbling down and a few of the newer, less fearful slaves roar in laughter. The other guards are not amused, though. One is able to close quickly and take a swing at the troublesome Solar.

Throughout the ship, the noise of the cabin simply exploding can be heard. It's clear something is going on up there. Someone is really screwing up Wavecutter's new ship. After the debris settles, Ryushi can see a beautiful girl with blind eyes being held by something big, black, and only vaguely human. It is a beast with the bottom form of a snake, and the torso of man with four arms and a swarm of tentacles growing out from its back. All around it the men of the ship stagger back. "You... dare take what is mine," it half-hisses, half-growls.

"Stop me if you can," Ryushi replies quietly. And swords out, he leaps.

Tanuki laughs and somersaults backward, easily evading the blow. "Guess you _really_ don't want to row, mister... whoa, what the hell?" he exclaims as the entire ship lurches to the sound of splintering wood. Ignoring the taskmaster, he jumps out of the hole to see what's going on. He does not like what he sees.

Whatever it is, it's not pleasant to look at. With time to really examine it, that black flesh seems to have faces moving under it, pressing out against it as if trapped and trying to break free. There's a sense that it's best if those faces do not, however. As soon as Ryushi leaps forward, a pair of tentacles lash out at him, each swinging at one of his swords. One of the beast's clawed hands close about Meggan's throat. "I had hoped to.. enjoy this moment, but if I must hurry.."

Tanuki's eyes narrow and glint with righteous fury. "Oh no you don't," he hisses, drawing his arm back. As he does so, he is seemingly transformed, his features obscured by a sudden cloud of glowing violent Essence in the iconic shape of a raccoon, with a glowing golden circle on its brow. The incandescent apparition flings two razor-like slivers of steel, arrowing in on the arm holding Meggan in a desperate attempt to save the girl's life.

The attack of the Exalt does not maim the creature, but it does draw blood, and with it causes the hand to fumble, and Meggan is nearly dropped. At least the crushing of her throat has been delayed, if not averted completely.

The tentacles strike at Ryushi's paired swords, knocking them out of his hands. He doesn't seem to care - instead, his hands close together and a golden blade of light shimmers into existence in his grasp. "Daoyang!" he shouts. His swords spin away behind him, landing on the deck, but his new weapon is all the more fearsome. As the creature flinches instinctively from the light, Ryushi's anima banner bursts forth into a brilliant display and he launches himself like a raging sunbolt.

The fury of the Bronze Tiger is simply too much for the unholy power that binds the sinews of this creature of darkness. The blazing blade of Orichalcum severs both arms on the beast's right side. Meggan falls to her knees at the creature's side, and the appendages that fall do not strike the deck, disintegrating into a fine black mist before they reach it. A horrible noise comes from the creature then, and it reels back, no longer looking to fight, but racing towards the rail to make it's flight.

Growling, Ryushi wheels and sprints after the retreating horror, Daoyang held out beside him in two hands. The guttering torch of Essence that surrounds him leaves after-images in the retinas of all who look, and as he leaps to come down on the back of the beast with his blade extended for the kill, blurred streak-lines are all that some can see.

Ryushi's swing chops clear through the darkened form, and the golden essence flashes out from the cutting edge of the sword like the thousand glinting needles. That black creature's body swells and bulges, wet, sloshing sounds come from it, and a great stink pours from it over the ship. Around Ryushi, a dark shadow spreads, reaching out for him, and then, as the wind blows across the ship, drifting futilely away, and leaving nothing behind but the fresh scent of the ocean and a promise of a new day.

Tanuki takes but a moment to be awed by the incredible force of Ryushi's assault, before running across the deck to Meggan's side. "Are you all right?" he cries out, taking her gently by the shoulders. He can't quite see what he looks like right now, but he can see the incandescent amethyst energy swirling him, and now more than ever he's glad she can't see it. Even to him, it's almost as scary as the monstrosity that Ryushi just dispatched.

Meggan needs a moment to react. She's shaking from head to toe. Hearing Tanuki's voice is a great relief. She throws herself at him, hugging tightly. She'll probably do that again when she finds Kitty is okay, too. The cat is still riding about with Wavecutter.

Leaping effortlessly onto the elevated railing, Ryushi surveys the ship - Blue Wave pirates and Navy scum alike. He spins his sword in his hand and drives it downward, penetrating a foot of wood like a knife through butter, and leaves it there. Then he asks a simple question, loudly enough for all to hear: "Now. Who wants to be my friend?"

The answer is resounding, even if it is a long time before any will speak. The sailors fall to their knees, some holding their hands up to cover their eyes. No one here has the courage to utter the word that is on every mortal mind. The word anathema seems unhealthy at this moment. The first mate from Wavecutter's ship asks, "What do you want from us?"

"Halt the battle," Ryushi orders. "The Blue Wave fleet surrenders." It is not a suggestion, nor a request. It is a statement of truth.

Wavecutter's first mate looks over at the unconcious captain, then turns to find the first mate of the ship. He is a scrawny, older man, and he looks rather green at the moment. He carefully considers for roughly a half a second and says, "Yeah, that sounds pretty good." He looks to another of his men, "Up the white flag! Now!" At least he's a decisive coward.

It takes a while for the other ships to figure out the symbol. The Blue Wind aren't used to surrender. They do eventually do as they are told. This naturally draws a lot of attention from the attacking ships, as well. It seems that very soon, Wavecutter and both of the outcastes will be joining the two Solars. The two Solars that are glowing so clearly they can be seen from quite a distance.

The outcastes aren't sure what to make of this. Still, they aren't going to cower, either. The men grumble enough at their hesitation to board. Wavecutter has no such problems, and she brings Meggan's cat with her. "Nice bit of work there," she says calmly, letting Kitty go. She smirks at Ryushi and Tanuki, "A touch on the unsubtle side, though." As if she is one to speak. She's got a most distinct glow about her as well, and she pulls her mask free, revealing a golden circle with a glowing dot inside it on her brow. "I see our friends have decided that sailing for me is better than being slaughtered for a bit of silver. How prudent of them." It is this moment that the outcastes pull themselves onto the ship, and realize that they face Anathema and also happen to be outnumbered.

"About as subtle as the whatever-the-hell-that-was that Ryushi took down," Tanuki points out, as Meggan is joyfully reunited with her Kitty. The shadowy figure with the glowing raccoon totem nods politely to the outcastes.

"Of coures, the same deal is open for you boys," says Wavecutter. "Unless you would like to try swimming back to Harborhead, of course. Still, don't you think we'll do better with sixteen ships and no king taking half of what we rake in?" This proposal naturally changes the way the dragon bloods look at this arrangement. They are businessmen first, and the bogey stories of the Anathema seem like a really handy way to make a crew work harder.. "There will be a few details to work out, but I think that sounds quite agreeable," says the first. "I like having my innards inside me and my skin out. I'm sure the deal will be a fair one."

---

After such a draining battle, the sailors celebrate as much as one can on a sailing vessel. After this, comes sleep, and with it, for the Solars, a dream unlike any they have had before.

It begins in a city so vast, and so beautiful, that it might move artists to weep. But it is also a city dark, and quiet, save for the padding of its remaining guardians, and the dripping of slowly dying fountains. The breath-taking buildings of crystal and bright stone show age clearly, and many are crumbling, some having fallen in upon themselves, leaving only darkened rubble.

The dream draws them past this failing beauty to an area where there is still some light left. To a broad fountain with silver water. On it's edge sits an old man. Though his skin seems weathered, there is the strength of a great warrior in him, and it radiates out. His eyes glow with a golden light, and his voice is unmistakable. "What have they said, child?" he calls out.

The man who steps from the darkness is hardly a child. Yet the word seems right, somehow, as well. The man's eyes have irises of green, and a strange green glow seems to be flickering above his brow. "I have spoken against your children, and a vote has been cast."

It becomes clear, somehow, who one of these figures is. The old man with eyes of golden light. His identity radiates from him clearly in the minds of the Solars. Helios, the Unconquered Sun, is he. The man speaking to him is not one of his Chosen, but there is a power to him, and an unshakable calm.

"We have failed." The Unconquered Sun shakes his head slightly. "We could not make a resolution." Helios looks untroubled, though his words are hardly encouraging, "Not since the fall have you failed in this way."

The old man seems unhappy to admit failure, but lying is beneath Chejop Kejak. "The Time of Madness may well be returning, Lord," he says at last. "Your children are waking, and growing strong once more."

"The sun can do nothing but rise," answers Helios. He sounds almost apologetic. He smiles as he goes on, "You did not truly think you could bottle them away forever, did you? My friend, you are too wise for that."

"Gaia is dying," says Helios softly. "And Yu-Shan has been dying since my children turned against me." And here Chejop speaks up quickly, "Yet now we turn to them again, when Creation stands balanced on the edge of a razor. My Lord, this is madness to me!"

Helios raises a hand, "Child, we have had this out before. You and your kindred are the guiders, the steady hand that prevents disaster and for all your knowledge, you do not have the power to lead. You cannot inspire men. In your desperation you have made it so men cannot even remember your names the moment you turn from them!"

Chejop does not speak out against Helios. "We have always done what is necessary, Lord. Gaia's failing was something we have long foreseen and we are prepared to right things once more."

The wizened form of Helios nods to Chejop. "You do what is necessary, but not what is right. That is why my children must return. I trust you to do what you will do, child. You must trust me to do what I will do, as well." Before Chejop can speak, the Unconquered Sun waves a hand at him, "Go now. Leave me to watch over my children, for they are already bringing back the light that has for too long burned only inside me."

And as Helios looks into that Silver pool, a pinprick of gold shines below, as a creature of darkness has its will shattered. Perhaps it is just a trick of the light, but in that moment, it seems that the form of Helios grows less old, and the fire of his eyes burns ever so slightly more brightly.

As the Solars are drawn from that dream, they hear a soft murmur, in that same rich voice. "Be what you were meant to be, my children." The very last vision of Yu-Shan they are granted is from far above, so that the sheer enormity of that city may be seen, and the full weight of the darkness and decay there will weigh heavily upon their shoulders, as will the nagging sensation that it's ruin was brought about by their mighty hands.
