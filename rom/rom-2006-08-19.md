For three days Wavecutter has piloted her flagship into the face of a hurricane. What lies beyond is something she has assured her fellow Solars will be vital to their futures. The crew is white-knuckled and terrified. On the first day two men were swept overboard, and after that, they no longer go above deck. Only Wavecutter and the Solars have the strength to see that the ship stays on its course. Vast mountains of water smash against the ship, and furious elementals rise from the waters. "There are worse things in this sea," warns Wavecutter, and none of the men ask her what she means.

Tanuki grits his teeth against the rain and wind. He's used to a much drier climate, and he's certainly used to the ground staying steady when he walks around. If it weren't for the gift of the Sun, he'd be feeding the fish by now, if not swept overboard with the other two unfortunates. But all this doesn't mean he _enjoys_ this kind of weather.

Ryushi endures the weather as well, as best as he can. The storm-gods rage in their titanic, meaningless struggles, the sea and the wind their weapons. The wars between mortal kingdoms, where the blood of peasants fertilizes the fields for the next harvest in the name of their monarchs' petty jealousies, is no less impersonal. Men die on the ocean in the wake of the gods' wars, not knowing why or how. The little surety Ryushi has is his own Exalted state - but will the spirits of the ocean care more for the Sun's Chosen than they do for other humans? Perhaps. Perhaps not.

It is the dawn of the third day. No ship should be able to withstand what has been arrayed against Wavecutter's vessel. Yet the timbers are uncracked, and the sails untorn. She glows like a star as the helm, but there are things other than weather, and when at last she reaches still water, it only makes her uneasy. The sea is so still that most would never find the wind, but Wavecutter manages it, and at last the ship casts its anchor within sight of a great island.

"The Island of Walking Dreams," says Wavecutter softly. She looks to her fellow Solars and says, "If I set foot there, we will all die. But there is a wealth in that island's jaws, and I want it uncovered. I've seen you work together. You get first pick of the loot, but we keep the deal and share any knowledge you get from it. And if it's something for a ship, I get it. Square?"

"Yer the boss, ma'am," agrees Tanuki. "Just wonderin, though... how come we can go an' you can't?"

"Cause I've been here before, once," says Wavecutter. "And if you come here twice, you die when you try to leave the island. None of you can pilot this ship out again."

Ryushi has no particular love for wealth or possessions; he is familiar enough with the cursed wonders of the lost age to be too anxious to accumulate them, and such a trap seems a clear indicator of great wealth - and great risk. Ambivalently, he nods. "We'll take what we need, and what is useful."

"So we better get all we can in one trip, then?" says Tanuki. The details as to _why_ you cannot come a second time are of little interest to him; it's all 'magic stuff'.

"Then get a move on. If you need help, signal from the shore. The men won't set foot on the shore, though." Wavecutter grins lopsidedly, "They would mutiny, if they didn't know that a massive hurricane would slaughter them without me." More loudly, she adds, "Of course, if they tried, I'd flay them alive and devour their souls, so it's really for the best." More quietly she says, "And good luck to you."

The men are brave enough (barely) to get the Solars within wading distance of the shore. The water near the island is smokey, chock-full of silt, but it doesn't feel like the greasy waters one encounters near a large city. The island itself is beyond anything the Solars have seen in the waking world. Though to Ryushi, parts of it may spark memories.

It is not an forest island, but appears to have once been a place where men lived. Every rock has been carved, but so long ago that at first the eye might think them natural forms. There are simply too many nearly square cuts, and close inspection reveals the long crumbled remains of statues, and scraps of metals that haven't been utterly consumed. Everything has been slowly losing a battle to the creepers and vines that are apparently native to this island, and cracks mar every surface. There is no sign of moving life here, however. The only noise is from the wind, and the occasional sound of cracking or falling stone from far in the distance. This place is literally falling apart around the Solars.

"Creepy," says Tanuki. This is hardly based on any specific observation; if he'd been a country boy, the lack of animal life would've worried him a lot more, but as a gutter rat in the streets of Harborhead, his impression is based more on the signs of what used to be buildings.

Ryu moves with one hand on his sword-hilt, as he's accustomed to do whenever he feels at risk. Though he is no architect, even his unpracticed eye has seen ruins aplenty. _Where,_ he asks himself, _are such buildings in pristine condition? Does anything of the old world remain untouched?_

The layout of the ruins, though from another time, seems fairly logical. By studying the remains of this part of the island, it is fairly obvious that this was a dock of sorts, but either the sea was deeper than, or the ships very different. The water now is only a few deep where once the docks of stone stuck out into the sea. A very wide span lies clear, and leads away from the shore perfectly towards the island center. Trees that once likely provided welcome shade to travellers on the road have grown so large their roots shatter the stones, but the glory of the first age remains to at least this extent: the stones give a very solid footing, and though creepers and trip weeds might devour much of the other stone, they strangely have not grown through the cracks here.

Mindful of the nature of the place, though somewhat ignorant of contemporary shipping practices, Ryushi still attempts to think through where the things of importance would be. A dry-dock, for repairs to the vessels berthing here, and all the ancient tools that Wavecutter could use; a storage warehouse; the commonly-tracked roads leading to the island's destinations, and where any remaining valuables might be found.

Tanuki's experience is not dissimilar, although in his case he's thinking of other possibilities. Anything that might look like a guard post gives an indication of how the Guard was laid out, and that in turn would guide him to headquarters and armories. Trade districts are unmistakable anywhere with sufficient architecture, and still discernible otherwise. Though his knowledge of how a city is laid out is limited to Harborhead, form follows function. The First Age may have had much greater magic, but they were still people.

One thing the searching does make clear is that the First Age was radically different. Despite the harbor being right here, there's no sign of dry docks nearby. In fact, it's clear to Ryushi that they were not located here. There is much of the island that hasn't been explored yet, so perhaps elsewhere he will have more luck. This isn't a market place, either. There are no large, open squares, where people might haggle. If anything, studying this place proves extremely confusing. The dock seems too large to be for just one person, and the water too shallow for ships, and the road so wide it seems clear that the ships must have brought in cart loads of goods.

Ryushi glances at Tanuki, expressing his confusion and frustration at the puzzle this place will represent. Nevertheless, he gestures in a long, inclusive wave of one hand. "We appear to have plenty to search for."

Tanuki nods. "Yeah..." he says, looking down the path. "Well, there's a road. No matter who built this place, if'n it was humans, then roads allus go _somewhere_."

The road does go somewhere. Roads definitely have a tendency to do that. This one often meets other roads, and old markers lie at every crossing. Most are damaged, but a few have escaped. The runes of the Old Realm cover them, and the best impression the Solars can make of this is that they are listing the names of places along the adjoining roads. The road leads straight on to growing mounds of rubble, and then, whole buildings start to show up on the horizon, and then the Solars see it at last. Though neither will know why, its name comes to them. It's in an ancient dialect of the ancient Old Realm language that was common to the west. Khaz-al-mharan. The name conjures two thoughts. On one hand, it implies a city of purity surrounded in smoke or fog. In another, it references an ancient myth borrowed by the Immaculates of a mad god who killed herself out of jealousy.

The city is certainly worthy of remembering. The impression the Solars get is that they once knew of this place. It's like recalling the old second-hand tale from a seedy bar, or hearing about the riches a man has tucked-away in his house from a an old man who once had an affair with a maid. The impressions are clearly second hand, but still strong enough for neither to doubt that the name is right. The buildings here are strong, and the shortest stand no less than four storeys, but their great height is dwarfed by a structure that stands at the western shore. There is a terrific pyramid, easily the tallest, most enormous structure the solars have yet to see. Even though miles separate them from that place, it seems almost to loom over them.

After a few more steps into the city, the Solars start to notice that things are very different here. The stone isn't cracked. The buildings are untroubled by the eroding winds, and most of their windows are still undamaged, their doors still on hinges (which open without so much as a creak), and there's a rather lived-in feel to this city. There's an impression that they should almost expect to see people still living here. But there's just an echo of what was. It's not just the wind. There are words whispering through the stone here.

Ryushi studies this as he walks, reflecting somberly that islands are given names for a reason.

Ryushi pokes into buildings at random, trying to get a sense for the place. His modern experience seems less valuable than it might be; now he relies on intuition and the half-heard whispers of an older soul to guide him.

Ryushi's explorations find some pretty amazing results. The houses are not just in good shape outside, but are perfectly preserved. So preserved that he may have to pause just to believe what he is seeing. In one of the homes, a full meal lies set-out on the table. He can smell a sweet scent from a hot pie that is still steaming warm. For just a moment, it's almost as if the shapes of a family are kneeling about that low table, with the matron bringing the last dish walking towards them. The vision comes and goes so fast that it's easy to discount it. Or would be in any other place.

Tanuki finally gets it. Now that the buildings are in good order, it's clear to him where the most wealthy lived. The first impulse are the biggest buildings, but he is able to quickly discount this by noticing the kind of wear on the stone. Poor people walk barefoot here, while the most wealthy wore shoes that scuffed the stone in front of their homes. He is also able to figure out that the guard houses were few and far between. It seems that one centralized building served the needs of the city. This last bit he gleans purely from the whispers he catches in a dark alley between two buildings. The whispers of thieves that have likely not seen a sunrise since the First Age.

Wary as ever, Ryu is mindful of the growing echoes of habitation. Wavecutter spoke only of never returning, but perhaps there is also danger in staying too long, becoming so enamored of ghosts that one joins them. He does not speak to Tanuki yet - so far, his fear seems groundless.

Armed with his knowledge, Tanuki chooses a likely mansion. From observation, this was probably the dwelling of a well-favored man - possibly a bearer of the Dragons' blood, if perhaps not favored with their blessing. There is a limit to what Ryushi and he can carry, but perhaps a few small and valuable trinkets will be worthwhile. "E'en Simeon couldnt'a afforded cups made o' jade," he comments. He looks around - this room is empty of any living being besides the two Solars, but the whispers of the rich man's household surround him. "What d'you think?" he says to Ryushi, fingering a small but exquisitely carved marbile figurine of an owl. "Think they'll come after us?" he adds, grinning.

"We'll know shortly," the warrior replies, ominously.

There is no immediate response from the whispers, though they do get a little louder when their goods are taken. There's a vague feeling of motion, but then nothing follows it. Whatever threat might lurk here, it's not revealing itself yet.

Tanuki glances to one side, in the direction of the pyramid. "Well, if we can't deal with one fat dead layabout an' his cronies, we ain't up to lootin' the big house," he says, lifting a few particularly valuable-looking articles and putting them into a pouch. And Tanuki is a good judge of such things if anyone is, for indeed he's had to make the value-volume tradeoff on a regular basis in his checkered career.

Ryushi nods. He pauses a moment, reciting a very old prayer to appease the unquiet dead, one that has crossed his lips many a time. It is habit, not fear, that drives his invocation.

Along the way, many buildings start to stick out. A blacksmith's forge is seemingly quite the same as it is now, though why it would have rows of seats around it is not quite clear. The road is growing even wider now, and as the pyramid comes closer, the Solars can see that they have now merged with the main street of this city. They are making directly for the pyramid. That vast work of an older age has a skillfully made set of stairs leading to its pinnacle, and along the way are doors on both sides opening to dark chambers inside.

The stairs are steep, but it initially seems the builders had some thought of pilgrims making the ascent, for large basins of stone are set at even intervals along the way. However, where the Solars might expect to find water, they instead find something more terrible. In every basin lies no less than ten hearts. The more trained eye will recognize that they are all human hearts. Congealed blood forms a sticky pool in these basins around them. Here and there, a soft scream can be heard. A child crying for her mother, a man offering a fervant prayer for a better fate in his next life, or lovers sharing their last tearful embrace. It seems clear that none of these sacrifices were made willingly.

Ryushi spares a glance at Tanuki, upon recognizing the basins' contents, and what it signifies. "Let us not repeat their example," he mutters, but continues ascending.

The top of the pyramid is a very long ways. The whispers do not change, but continue. They only give way after the last basin before the pinnacle. The Solars can see that a vast altar is set there, and the smell of it is strong. Up here, there are whispers that are not human. They are rasping, and drawn out like the hissing of snakes, and the language is so alien that it would see impossible that a human ever uttered it. Should the explorers at last look upon the altar, they will see five goblets, each bearing one of the symbols of the Unconquered Sun, and in each is a great heart, and each, through some trick of sorcery, is still beating.

From this highest point on the island, the secrets of the city are revealed. At least some of them. The construction was done with great care, though any signifigance is beyond the Solars' understanding. The streets spread from the pyramid like rays of light from the sun, and they change course in suspicious way that are equally baffling. All that can be told is that larger buildings lie opposite the entry point of the Solars, and that several enormous buildings have roofs that are partially opened.

Although fear holds no place in the Solar swordsman's heart, the awareness of danger is enough to overwhelm whatever more delicate instincts he may have about the city. His senses, though, are keyed up and alive, and he immediately spots what appears to be a ship - nestled inside a building within the city. A ship that flies is his first instinct, and he brings it to Tanuki's attention.

"Huh. Well, that might 'splain why there wasn't enough water at the dock," Tanuki comments. "Something like that wouldn't need none. Let's go have a look after we're done here."

Having seen enough of the altar, and caught glimpse of a most interesting ship, it is perhaps understandable that the Solars are eager to go down the stairs to where the whispers of the long-dead are least of their own kind. The first door is as good a place to start as any. It seems that both left and right doors lead into the same chamber. At least if they are like this level. There is little to be seen in here at first, but as the Solars make their way farther inside, illumination suddenly springs into being from the ceilings. Little glowing spheres are the source, and while it's not as bright as day, they banish the darkness effectively, and reveal walls covered with pictures and runes. It seems like a history of those who lived here.

The Solars move to the stairs and being their descent. It's clear fairly quickly that this path wasn't meant for pilgrims. It is steep, and the way is long and difficult with no places to rest. The Solars also feel a strange tingling sense from time to time, and there's a growing sense that something is going to happen. Still on the stairs go, and it seems they must be under the level of the street by now. Without warning, those stairs come to an end before an enormous doorway. The great work that once blocked it shut lies in ruins before them, it's surface of jade bashed as if a ram had slammed against it. A ram trying to get out of the chamber beyond. Not in.

Tanuki grimaces. "Whatever busted outa here ain't to be trifled with. Let's hope it din't wanna stick around after," he says, peering past the threshold.

"Do we?" asks Ryu sardonically.

The two Solars can cross the threshold without trouble or incident. The chamber beyond is truly vast, though most of it is also very empty, save for broken items. These scraps are bits of wood, and cloth. The best the Solars can piece together is that these were once used to sculpt something like a forest here. The cloth that served as leaves even feels like the real thing. In the farther corner this debris gives way to a rather out of place bedroom. The bed is enormous, and several dresses and desks are arranged around it. Here the whispers are soft, and the teasing scent of perfume from many concubines is in the air. On those dresses are many cunningly made items. One of which catches Tanuki's eye right away.

Tanuki laughs, and with a saucy grin saunters up to the dresser, picking up something that looks like a rounded cup with two straps... the whole thing gleams, like gold with sunlight shining on it, despite the dimness of the chamber. "Heh, what's this? Some kinda Solar jockstrap?" he asks, turning it this way and that in his hands.

As Tanuki does so, though, he feels something warm and glowing pass from him into the device, and the seemingly solid golden metal suddenly softens and flops down, as if it were cloth or leather. "Huh?" he says. Then an idea occurs to him, and he reaches into a pocket, pulling out a smooth stone, and drops it into the pouch. It fits perfectly. He swings the thing around a few times. "Yeah. Yeeeeeeah. It's some kinda sling! Now _this_ is more like it."

Ryushi smiles appreciatively. "Congratulations. At least we will not leave empty-handed."

Ryushi spends his time exploring as well, and returns with a harness, a pair of boots, and a peculiarly-shaped dial-like device. "A hearthstone compass!" he announces, explaining the thing's function. "My master used such things in the search for lost Manses. Certainly these will be useful to us. The boots and harness are.. well, we will discover their exact function, but something tells me that I've seen them before."

Tanuki's own search turns up several other devices as well. "Well, I dunno what this stuff does, but it's obviously very clever stuff. Someone's bound to find somethin' they can do with it," he says, speaking from experience; artifacts are always useful. One of the objects is a small medallion with intricate runes, another is a cloak clearly woven with black jade and other Magical Materials, and...

"But _these_... I don't like 'em." Tanuki is holding something that looks like a dog collar, but large enough for a human. "Somethin' about 'em turns my stomach. They look too much like the sorta thin' me master used to make me wear." Though he doesn't know it, it's a good thing for Tanuki his erstwhile master _didn't_ have collars like this, or else even he would not have escaped... nor wished to.

After some discussion regarding the island's apparent curse, Ryushi suggests the following: the most valuable portable items should be returned to the raft. If it can be poled off-shore, the ships' crews can safely retrieve it, then let the tide wash it back. Other shipments can then be carted out, depending on the safety factor.

"If these were grave-goods in Sijan, I wouldn't dare touch them," Ryu finishes. "But these are the wonders of our predecessors, and the wealth of men long since gone. Provided we are respectful, I have no compunction about robbing tombs, even if they come in the form of cities."

"I figger we use th'raft for the stuff we _can't_ easily carry - though it oughta be valuables anyway, cos we don't wanna waste space," says Tanuki. "What we _can_ carry, we do. Trust me, that'll be plenty. I got lotsa experience takin' only what I can carry," he adds, grinning lopsidedly.

After figuring out exactly what they are doing with their findings, the Solars turn their attention to the strange ship that Ryushi saw from atop the pyramid. The building is not easy to find, but knowing its general location cuts the search time down considerably. The Solars have to force the door to the building, but it is hardly a difficult feat. They go up three levels, and then they see it: a ship that is floating right in front of them. Several ropes hold it in place, and a rather complex looking aparatus that is apparently used to load and unload heavy items from the ship.

Ryushi approaches gingerly. The thing before them is organic, alive in its lines, like a bird or creature of the sea built to glide. It doesn't take the Solar long to discover the cockpit - the nexus point for the First Age's enigmatic controls can be nothing else. His worn boots click-clack on the grated surface of the deck, a sound he has never heard before. He stops to listen. Around him, the whole building becomes alive to him, but the vessel in particular has a song he now cocks an ear to.

The flow of air through ducting systems, the heating and cooling of metal, are the pulse and the breath. The slight shifting of moonsilver pieces, the cricking of jade gears and the faint rasping of Essence pouring through the wondrous artificial bird imbue it with a sort of pseudo-life. Ryu tugs off one of his gloves and runs a callused hand along the railing. He smiles, regarding the controls with an expert occultist's eye. "You're more steed than ship, aren't you," he murmurs to the craft. "Let us find your reins.."

To Ryushi's occult sense, the mysteries of the great creature of essence and craft that he touches lie revealed. The controls are intuitive. They are so simple, in fact, that most of the Realm's current pilots would find them confusing. He is easily able to shift the great ship with gentle motions, and learns how to open and close the ship's hold. The ship is completely operational. It was not here for repairs. It was here to pick up delicate goods. Goods that were mostly loaded at the time of its abandonment. Two great objects are set in the hold right now, and carefully secured. Another two similar items are resting on the floor of the chamber.

Ryushi investigates the items in the hold, confident now that the pair can succeed even in extremis.

Under the concealing covers of the cargo, the Solars find things that are likely outside their experience. The two items that are loaded on the ship are both of the same kind. At first, the shape is confusing, with coils of orichalcum, and much of the rest made of blue jade, brass, and silver. However, when the Solars step back, the familiar form of a ballista can be made of the complex work. But there's no place to load darts. Another oddity is that both items have mounting points for spherical shapes. Currently, both are occuppied by dull rocks with a rather glassy quality to them.

Outside the ship the findings are perhaps more straight forward. A pair of massive cannons with barrels of white jade. Like the artifacts aboard the vessel, they have the same spherical mounting points. These are simply gaping sockets, however, without anything fixed into them.

The scavenger lord's bodyguard has been dwelling on their findings, and with the discovery of the ship - and these weapons - a realization hits him. "I know what some of these things are," he announces to Tanuki, abruptly. "Those collars? Control devices, to enslave someone's mind. But the ship made me think.... there was a story once, of the vessel called Warbird's Cry..." He briefly relates a tale his master told him, about a skyship able to 'watch' what happened around it through artificial eyes and ears.

"We would need a master craftsman. But.. if you fear for Meggan's freedom, and want to give her a gift... reverse the action of the collars. Tie the vessel's systems to the collar, allowing her to control its actions and see through its eyes."

Tanuki grimaces, realizing what he knew about the collars without knowing it. But as Ryushi goes on... "Wow. So she'd be able to... wow. Damn, that'd be awesome. That'd be worth these damned things existin' in the first place," he says, glaring at the slave collar.

With a smile on his face, Ryushi talks and listens further. There's more to find in the ruins, and more to do...

The ship is approximately 70 yards in length, with a cargo capacity of 30 yards of that. One pilot and two co-pilots can control the vessel and its weapons, including the stinger-like tail. It is a functional transport craft, armed with weapons of unknown but dire potentiality.

Ryushi handles the heavy lifting, being rather brawnier than Tanuki - he leaves the lighter, more delicate treasures to his fellow Solar. What is meant for Wavecutter and her crew will go to the raft; what the Solars mean to keep for themselves will go aboard the vessel they've encountered.

The jade, the clothing, the wonders of First Age living, the utensils - these things are of clear value to the crews of the ships out in harbor, and will serve to bolster their courage.

Tanuki does keep one set of fine clothing in his size, though. Sometimes, when running a scam, it can be handy to dress the part... although he's going to have to learn how to speak like someone who wears stuff like this. Maybe Wavecutter can teach him.

As for the weapons, Ryushi suggests loading them into the skyship, but has no great need to carry them beyond Wavecutter.

Tanuki can barely read, let alone read Old Realm, but he's robbed enough arrogant savants to know what an arrogant savant keeps around the house. The goodies that adorn _these_ savants' houses make the average Harborhead scholar look like Tanuki, but they are still unmistakable. The books, however... "Hey, Ryushi, can you read these squiggles at all? I can't make head or tail of 'em," he says. "I know the Scavenger Lords pay top jade for this crap, but I can't never tell which ones're better'n others." The idea of being gotten the better of in a sale rankles Tanuki.

Ryushi remembers hearing these items called a few different things. Dream stones, vision stones, tutor stones. Moreover, he was able to recall secretly figuring out how they function and can verify that these seem to work. He doesn't have time to delve deeply into them, but they are clearly related to ancient geography, and show hallucinations of places so wonderful they could take his breath away. The thick old realm speech is hard for him to comprehend, but fortunately they seem to reference the maps stored here, and he is already beginning to puzzle out the peculiarities of this dialect.

Ryushi is clearly aware of the value of such things - where once there were cities, there are now ruins. And where ruins are, there also is treasure.

The warrior lugs his latest findings back to the boat, and finds Tanuki doing the same with his own treasures. "I think we're at the line between profit and greed."

"Greed's when you take more than ye can carry," Tanuki retorts with his trademark grin. "So..." he looks at the laden vessel. "So yeah, we're at that line."

Ryushi spends some time educating Tanuki in the ship's operation, mindful that if they are to use this vessel, both men must be able to pilot it. With that, he volunteers to unmoor the advanced craft and take to the sky, rendezvousing with Wavecutter at sea.

At first, things seem quite in-control and calm. Wavecutter's men panic at the sight of the ship, but she does not. It's like nothing she's seen before, true, but she's just got a feeling. Or her eyes are just that keen. She raises a hand and waves at the ship, and then all hell breaks loose.

Up from the water two large dragon-like shapes rise, their bodies made of sheets of glittering jade and claws of Orichalcum. Though they are not as large as the ships the Solars control, their is a terror that radiates all around them, and while it's also clear that much damage has been done to these creations of an ancient age, there is still much power that remains.

Ryushi shifts the controls, rapidly aiming for Wavecutter's flagship. "We need her to fly this!" he shouts to Tanuki. "Throw her a rope!"

Tanuki nods, and quickly moors a line to a railing inside the ship, then throws the other end out. "Ahoy!" he calls down to Wavecutter. "We need a pilot on this thing so's Ryushi c'n have his hands free!"

Wavecutter assesses the situation calmly and swiftly. "Abandon ship!" she bellows. Being an astute pirate, she first cuts loose the small boat that still holds most of the loot and then grabs hold of the line with the other. Her men are sensible enough to heed her words, as well. As she smoothly climbs that rope, the first attack of the dragons blasts againt the ship. Their breath comes out like sunlight, and everything it touches is seared away. Soon her ship is in flames. The men in the water watch on in horror. They are fortunately beneath the notice of the dragons.

Ryushi turns the controls over to Tanuki, then rushes out to the deck. He grabs hold of the line Wavecutter is ascending, yanking it upwards with force enough to send the woman right to the edge of the deck. As she scrambles aboard, his shortsword flashes out of its sheath and cuts the line. He loops the frayed end twice around his hand, then leaps overboard himself, yelling behind him: "Fly-by!"

Wavecutter doesn't even stop to look at Ryushi. She's too seasoned to waste time right now. She takes the controls and with essence pulsing through her, brings the ship fully to life. The wings sweep back, and essence springs out to take their place. The ship moves far faster with her guiding it, and Ryushi finds himself soaring past the dragons, who still focus wholly on turning the other ship into a torch.

Ryushi swings wide, building up momentum on the rope he dangles from. As the ship angles past the dragon, he's on the backswing. He releases the rope, tucks himself into a tight cannonball with hands before him, and yells a name: "Daoyang!"

The sword appears, making itself the deadly sharp point of a speeding Solar missile, and Ryushi flies at high speed directly at the Dragon's head.

Tanuki doesn't waste any time heading to the back. The fire controls were unfamiliar until a few hours ago, when Ryushi explained them, but something about them appeals to his instincts... and more particularly to his experience with slings and knives. Under the direction of his deft hands, the tail swivels around to point toward one of the dragons, lightning crackling along its sharp edges...

Tanuki presses the firing stud, and feels every hair on his body stand on end as elecric Essence floods through the system. The crackling fire gathers itself into a ball, and then launches itself at the dragon as the First Age flying vessel swoops past.

First the plating around the great dragon's head is further punctured and shorn, and sparks rain out as internal gears are damaged by the massive impact. Following Ryushi's attack is a blast to the undercarriage of that hulking form that sends a thick plate of jade to the bottom. The construct does not hesitate. It bolts towards the island, moving at great speed, heedless of pursuit and leaving the battle for the other dragon.

Daoyang embedded itself into the head of the Dragon, and Ryushi vaults up to crouch on the edge of the blade. Essence flows through him, energizing the jump harness he now wears, and another Charm. He will need to leap far.

The second of the dragons remains behind and focuses its malice upon the more grave threat, the ship that soars above it. It leaps skyward, and though its flight is hardly what it once was, it is still a threat. A might claw swings at the flying vessel, and Wavecutter's skills are pitted against its wrath.

Wavecutter has never been in a ship that handles like this. She reaches out with essence and the wings respond, sending the ship in a sudden, rolling dive. It rockets down towards the water at full speed, looking as if she were about to try and dive under the water.

Behind her, mindful that a return to the island means death, Ryushi leaps in a powerful, inhumanly long jump. He flashes through the air toward the remaining opponent, extending a hand behind him - and Daoyang comes, prying its way out of the escaping Dragon's skull to faithfully return to his hand.

The essence flying through Wavecutter catches an initial slip-up with the unfamiliar controls just in time for her to remedy it, swinging it with great accuracy and pulling away. The blow still lands, but the hull holds strong, torn by the mighty attack, but not breached as it plunges below the waves, and then is drawn up in a screeching climb.

As the Dragon's head tilts up to follow the ascending skyship, Ryushi's body hurls itself through the air to land in a tight crouch on the brow. With a battlecry in High Realm, the Solar rakes his shimmering golden blade through the imperishable metal of the Dragon. Two artifacts of the Solar empire collide, testing their fate against one another, but only one of these is backed by the power and the fury of a roaring demigod.

"What the Hell?" Tanuki cries out, wiping the water from his eyes, as he sees the other Dragon speeding away toward the island. "That's a machine! Machines don't run away! Somethin' called it back!" With no regard for the Dragon still breathing down their necks, he hauls on the control yoke, and the tail bends almost double as it swerves to follow the fleeing Dragon. His thumb stabs the firing button again, and the sharp smell of ozone fills the cockpit as another crackling sphere follows in the dragon's frothing wake.

The first dragon continues to race away, moving at full speed and staying low. Wavecutter has to make a choice to pursue or not. She decides to not give chase, since Ryushi doesn't look ready to take a swing from that dragon. "Let's get the men out of the water and blast out of here!" she commands. Being at the pilot's station, her voice booms out from the ship for Ryushi to hear.

The second dragon continues its attack. It's wrath remains fixed right on the vessel that flies about it, even as the dawn caste shreds it to bits. It's jaw opens for an attack and it rushes through the air to strike at the flying ship.

Wavecutter's motions prove the more agile this time. The great dragon's teeth clash together, just short of the rushing hull of the flying ship. Wavecutter brings it about, slowing to give Tanuki a better shot.

Exploding into a corona of Solar fire, Ryushi throws Daoyang out into space, leaping behind it. He lands on the snout of the dragon, catching the blade and bracing himself with his foot, turning forward momentum into a vicious triad of slashes at the creature's artificial face.

The battered and ancient creature screems in a paroxysm of artificial agony, its linnk to the Hearthstone chamber in its brow severed by Ryushi's last slash. As the Solar leaps away, a violent explosion of Magical Materials and contrails of Essence follows him. The head of the Dragon is bright as the sun for a moment, and in the afterimages of the explosion, it falls to the ocean. A smokey trail marks its gentle descent, and the waves its bulk kick up attest to the thing's size and power.

Tanuki laughs softly at the great First Age machine's death throes. "Damn... he kicks ass, doesn't he?" As Wavecutter brings the vessel down to the water's edge, he busies himself in helping the rest of the men aboard. It's going to be a tight fit, but somehow they'll manage, especially as they tie extra rope to any available surface to use as handholds. The spare boat is looted as much as the men can manage, each of them pocketing whatever jade trinkets they can carry.

"Some further trap is at work," says Ryushi bluntly, once he's back onboard. He ignores the stares of the crew as he walks past them, gesturing for Wavecutter and Tanuki to see. He points to the center of the island. "Something is happening there. We'd best be away as soon as we can."

"I agree," says Tanuki, his feeling of nameless dread still hovering over him. "Let's get the Hell outta here."

The iconic anima banner of the Stone Wave surrounds the Warrior, after his battle with the twin dragons. Essence brighter than daylight swirls around him, but even as he speaks, Ryu can see currents and eddies in his own anima. The image which surrounds him streaks, as the Essence of his own body is caught up in the furthest edges of the effect. He frowns.

Wavecutter doesn't need further instruction. "Let's see how fast this thing can go." There are fortunately enough places for everyone to sit, though this isn't really a passenger craft. It's lucky the crew was only a skeleton one. The ship rushes out to meet the horror of the storm, but before it gets far, the storm breaks up, and the passengers can see to their horror that the storm gods are rushing past them. They are fleeing as fast as their winds can carry them. In the waters, elementals are rushing away, joined by panicked creatures of the sea.

"Oh shit," Tanuki says, his eyes wide, feeling a dread that makes him think of how the mortals feel when they watch Ryushi or himself. Anything that sets this mighty storm's spirits to flight is... well, he's just glad they've got a fast ship, that's all he can say.

There is no warning. The ship is suddenly tossed by rough winds, and Wavecutter's motions are a blur as she she guides the craft through a horrible burst of rushing air. Then suddenly everything turns white for several seconds, and even when those on board shut their eyes, they are blinded. Only after several minutes of blind flying can they see again. "What the hell was that?!" barks out Wavecutter. Behind them, the Solars can see the island is nothing but a steaming crater that the sea is rushing to fill. The tsunamis it causes will bring terrors of their own to the islands for hundreds of miles.

Ryushi raises his hand when the blast hits, and only after several seconds does he cease shielding his eyes. He blinks rapidly, assessing the new situation, and sighs. "A final trap. But given what we found there... this is for the best."

"...the... FUCK... was that?" says the Trickster, for once too awestruck and horrified to wisecrack. At least not right away. He rubs his eyes again, and blinks. "Yeah... well, Ryushi, guess we don't need ta worry bout settin' foot on it again, at least."

"Whatever it was, it's put the end to a legend," says Wavecutter. "I just hope that the rest of the ships are in one piece. The sea's gonna be pretty rough with that kind hole in it." She focuses on flying, and studying the elementals and spirits that still race beside the ship. "I guess if you want to get wonders of the old age, you have to face its terrors, too."

"That is true of ourselves as well," murmurs Ryushi, mostly to himself.

While riding away from the ruin of that lost city, Ryushi is able to catch something in his mind, something that sings to him of movement and power. For a moment, he sees a past that was not his own, and he remembers an island where the greatest map makers of the world once lived. He recalls the morning drills of the guards, how they would test their might against each other under the eyes of their Dragon King captains just after dawn, and devote the noon break to prayer and meditation to the Unconquered Sun.

In the spirit of Tanuki it is another matter. Cunning were the lords of this city, and cleverly did they trick the great gods of storms Khelek and Nevaar to prove who was the greater in a contest that would last throughout an age. The waters about the wondrous isle were defended against all but the most powerful of enemies, and overly curious eyes were barred passed by that raging storm.

The memories take them through the ages, and the story of that place unfolds in their mind. The name of Khylandra the Great and her consort Ten Fangs comes most often into these tales, and the full horrors of this place are played out in a space of seconds of rushing memory.

The tale is brought to them in visions, and in the soft chanting of an old man's voice. It is a familiar sound, though it is impossible to place. "Khylandra was the most beautiful of women in the west, and everything that she desired had to remain her own. Even when her interest passed, she would suffer none to escape her. She made wrong the geomantic lines of her great city, and in terror her husband Ten Fangs fled their chamber. The curse fell upon him later, when he returned to find his wife once more. She had become utterly consumed by her jealousy, and she had killed every man, woman and child so they might never leave her. In the end, broken and splintered, she went to the sea and saw her reflection in the water."

"And there, in the water, her face was staring up at her, but she did not know it. That beautiful, perfect face that had made warm the hearts of the most powerful war gods at every festival in Yu-Shan, no longer was her own," says the voice sadly. "She clawed at it, wanting to marr anything that might be more beautiful than she. In the end, seeing that she could not harm it, she called upon a demon and ordered it to kill the creature she saw in the water. Bound by the oaths of old, the demon tore her apart as she commanded. The island has been a place of whispers ever since. And now? Now it falls truly to the darkest of shadows."
