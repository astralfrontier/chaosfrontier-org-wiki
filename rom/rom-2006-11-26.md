Megara arches an eyebrow. "Well, that's a new trick. At least we don't have to question if we have the original." Maragal uses his time to poke about the other crates in the room, going through a mental checklist. "Not much else here is worth muddling over. A few old statues and nothing that sticks out. Guessing would be a roll of the dice."

"We're bringing the archivist with us," Ryushi announces. "Let's get him and leave."

Megara sighs softly. At least she doesn't argue. "Then let's be about our work. He's well out of the way, and he's about as safe as you can be in this place right now." Right on cue, the Heptagram shakes violently, causing the scholar to stumble. "If anything is safe," she amends grimly.

"I gave my word," is all Ryushi will say. He wheels and starts walking with renewed purpose, cradling the portrait carefully.

Tanuki snorts. "Yeah, I think that's kinda Ryu's point," he says - although his body is physically unperturbed by the temblor, he's all too aware of the danger it implies, as he follows in Ryushi's wake.

"I think I should point out something," says Megara hastily. Another quake rocks the Heptagram, and this time it's violent enough to make Maragal stumble in his heavy armor, and Megara has to lean on the most stable point near here. That would be Ryushi. "I think the demons are below. They must be fighting below. This school was built on ground that isn't normally stable."

"Then aid me in moving faster," the swordsman replies curtly.

"If you think I'm going to try working sorcery in this, you are truly mad," replies Megara. Maragal considers for a moment, then notes, "I have an idea that will speed us up." Just as the scholar is about to ask, the Captain throws her over his shoulder and plows on, ignoring the indignant squawking of Megara.

Ryushi and Tanuki lead the way, with the Captain and his 'cargo' close behind. The pair plow through piles of rubble that have appeared since they last came this way, finally breaking through to where the archivist is hiding out. Ryushi grabs hold of the man with one hand, pulling him to his feet from the nook where he had been cowering, and points up. "What's above us?" he demands. "How far to the roof?"

"R-r-roof?" squeaks the archivist. He barely can stay on his feet when the ground isn't moving. "Oh for the love of!" grumbles Megara. "This is ridiculous, put me down this instant and let's-" Maragal sighs and swats the scholar helpfully on, well, a place that reduces to her muttering threats and promises involving the good captain. Maragal remains unphased and answers, "The easiest way to the roof is back towards the hold we just left, but we'll be wanting to get north and east. We can find the exercise area that way. Lots of open space. We just need to get our ride's attention."

"If that's faster than simply breaking through, then let's go." Ryu nods, hoisting the archivist over his own shoulder.

Tanuki raises an eyebrow at the proceedings, but shrugs. "Whatever gets us outa this damn place faster," he remarks.

"Well, the ground is likely to fall last is all," says Maragal. He rushes ahead, trying to lead the way through a building that is becoming less and less structure and more and more rubble. "What a waste.. it'll all be on the bottom of the sea at this rate," murmurs Megara. She's squirmed about enough to have a look around. "Better it than us," replies the captain. A noise like a steady roaring is growing as the group turns away from their path and makes their way closer to the exit. Just behind Tanuki a huge chandelier plummets to the ground, bursting in an explosion of essence.

Ryushi keeps up a steady pace. His only response to the bursting sound he hears is to shift the painting forward with his arm, shielding it with his body. His eyes fairly burn with intensity as he surveys the route ahead.

Tanuki hops nimbly onto a nearby bundle of fallen shelving almost as soon as the chandelier starts falling, and drops easily behind it as all the chandelier's light bursts free in a split second. All this happens as casually as if he were walking down the street. "Wow, instant suntan," he mutters as he pops out again.

On the group rushes, and Maragal often has to alter his route. This area of the Heptagram is just starting to burn, and the flames soon cut off any route back into the school. One would think the Captain would rush outside with a great sigh of relief, but a sound like a hundred thunderclaps brings him up short, and he flattens himself by the door, trying to peer out. Even without looking, it's obvious there's a battle going on outside. The walls light up with blue and red and green bursts, and the intensity has caused the glasswork on the door to shatter.

When the Solars are able to steal a look outside, they behold a scene of utter chaos. No less than a hundred demons are on the exercise field, matched against four Realm Airships. Essence canon fire rocks the ground, blasting aloft demons and allies alike. Like fodder mortals pit themselves against blood apes and other found beasts, aided by brave Terrestrial Knights. In the middle of the lines a greater demon moves, standing some ten feet tall and over half that length wide, with enough strength to shatter his enemies with a single punch.

The greater demon is not unchallenged for long. Around it a wide spaces opens as four old men move peacefully into battle, striking their way through the blood apes that would bar them with ease. The glow of essence envelopes each as they ready themselves for their real opponent.

Ryushi roughly divests himself of the screaming archivist, setting the man down on his feet (but maintaining a hold on him to prevent a panicked escape). "Tanuki..." The swordsman contemplates a moment. "Can I entrust this to you?" Though he does not say what, he means the portrait. "Get aboard the _Sun's Messenger_ as fast as you can. I will cover our escape."

Tanuki looks down from the scrollwork on which he's balanced, two feet above Maragal's head. "Seriously? You're gonna fight yer way outta _that_?" he asks, jerking a thumb toward the war going on outside as he hops down. "I mean, if there's no other way outta here, I don't mind tryin, but..." He glances to Maragal.

"Maragal, you too. Protect your mistress and this man." Ryushi is staring out toward the fight, unmoving.

Maragal considers his options carefully. He sets Megara down and holds a finger up to her before she can say a word. "You are going to get out of here alive, Cynus Megara, or I will break into the Underworld and turn you over my knee." For a moment, Megara looks outraged, ready to snap the Captain's head off. It lingers there for a moment, and something changes. She smiles with a warmth that she never has shown before, "You will live, or I will bind your spirit and make you dance for me." The Captain turns to Ryushi and nods, "They'll get out before I do." He readies his blade, looking excited, rather than afraid.

Tanuki takes the painting under his arm. "Don't worry, Ryu, I'll keep yer new girlfriend safe. Well, safe as I'll be, any road." He grins roguishly, and steps back as the shadows of the hall enfold him.

Ryushi carefully puts the painting in Tanuki's grasp, then takes a deep breath. He begins walking, holding up a hand. Essence begins to accumulate in a sphere, and he makes a rapid downward motion. "Daoyang!" he calls, and the streaking golden Essence radiates blindingly, leaving his sword in the afterglow. He slings it over one shoulder as he enters the open space.

Maragal hesitates. The cry of Ryushi is enough to light a fire inside him. He has his duty, however, and he stays close to Megara and the archivist. "Lead the way, Master Tanuki. If anything looks at us funny, I'll relieve it of its head." Megara is moving quietly, and doing what she can to keep the stumbling archivist going as well.

Ryushi walks steadily across the exercise field, his massive golden blade propped nonchalantly on one shoulder. He draws power to himself time and again, enhancing his combat abilities and mobility, making of himself a superhuman swordsman. He murmurs a silent prayer to the Unconquered Sun, wishing protection for Tanuki and that which he carries. He feels no fear; the journey of ten thousand leagues has brought him to his goal at last. He knows he will overcome.

The battlefield is turning swiftly into a graveyard as mortals and demons fall. The strength of the terrestrials is all that holds the men in their lines. In the center the hideous voices of demons roar out in a terrible chant, "OCTAVIAN! OCTAVIAN!" In the face of that great demon, mortals are of no use, and even the mastery of the monks is barely able to slow him. The essence canons blast more and more desperately, but then a sound like the beating of many winds can be heard overhead, and the light of the moon is blocked as some winged horrors rush at the Realm's Navy.

Even Ryushi, Maragal, and Megara have some difficulty perceiving Tanuki as he slips out of the doorway, for the shadows are already answering to his call. "Stay close, so y'don't lose me," he hisses, as he scans the courtyard, looking for a way to go that will attract as little attention as possible. Such routes are few in the thick fighting, and ultimately it comes down to a matter of cover. His allies - particularly the mortal archivist - cannot follow everywhere he can go, but he can lead the way to a path they can. He is no tactician, but he can approach the problem from the perspective of a sneak-thief: where can we go that we will be least noticed?

It quickly becomes clear that, if any such route exists, it is for the Solars and their immediate allies alone. The greater bulk of the Realm forces have no such hope. The great demon who rules the courtyard, and the winged horrors that fly at his command, will carry the day, and no one of human descent shall survive unless they flee for their lives.

The archivist is the most difficult of those following Tanuki. He keeps whining and whimpering under his breath, and Megara has to constantly glare him into silence. As the path comes near a mutilated body, the man has to stop to throw up. In some circumstances, Megara would roll her eyes, but the mauling of the body is so hideous that it even registers as terrible in her mind. Maragal, being a warrior, is able to avoid that distraction. At least for now. It can haunt his nightmares later, after he's finished his work.

Tanuki shudders as well, seeing no reason to hide his horror and revulsion. "So... urgh. Yeah, we better keep movin'," he remarks, scrambling along the side of another fallen obelisk and peering underneath it. He pauses there, counting under his breath, then scurries back to inform the party how many demons are obstructing the next gap in their escape route, and where they'll be running to after the foes are dealt with. Maragal may be the one to take point in other circumstances, but Tanuki has the inestimable advantage of being hard to find, and they are unlikely to face any traps in their escape that are not demons.

With startling speed, Ryushi launches forward in a surprise attack. Octavian's back is turned; the golden blade Daoyang is ready. He slashes at the creature as he passes, then wheels to deliver another deadly blow. Then his eyes catch sight of something, and he instantly changes tactics.

The swordsman's third slice cuts the cord holding a severed, shrunken head to Octavian's belt. The severed head of a once-great warrior whose brow still holds the faint traces of a starburst of the Dawn Caste Mark and an ancient Hearthstone. Letting go of Daoyang with one hand, he snatches it up with the other and leaps away. He alights on a thick-beamed trestle which is only half-consumed by fire and thrusts the head out for all the demons to see. And he lets forth a prodigious, wordless shout.

Tanuki grimaces as Ryushi calls out his challenge. "O-kay. I better call our ticket outta here, or we're all dead," he mutters under his breath, as he scrambles up the tallest undamaged pillar he can find. From the top, he looks out over the carnage, and sighs. "So much for not bein' seen." And with that, he bursts into violet and indigo flame, briefly casting shadows over the entire battlefield even over the actinic glare of Essence cannon.

"Well, the party is over now," murmurs Maragal. The flare of light draws the eyes of demons on the outskirts of the battle, but the hideous brilliance of the Dawn Caste warrior holds the attention of those in the thick of things. This sudden appearance lights a fire in the hearts of the mortals and their captains alike, and they fight like madmen, throwing themselves at the demons with renewed vigor, ignoring their wounds for this one chance at immortal glory. In the sky Mars glints bright red, pleased by this great offering.

Octavian roars in outrage, and he no longer plays with his foes. With a blurring strike and a backwards swing like a whip he sends two of monks to the ground where blood apes cast themselves on them and rend them, heedless of how many of them will die in their mad assault.

With the battle renewed with tireless vigor and wrath the glow of the Sun's Messenger finally comes into view. The great tail whips around just as a cloud of winged demons turns to confront this new threat and like a parade of torches they burst into flames. With Meggan's expert handling, the ship darts in, lowering just long enough for Maragal to throw both Megara and the archivist on board, and then darts upward for Tanuki. In this same motion Meggan tilts the ship, opening fire on the rear of the demonforces, shattering the ground in gouts of white-blue fire. The ship waits for just a moment before rushing forward, diving lower to smash through the left flank of Octavian's lines, pulling up just before the Realm forces suffer the same fate and banking hard enough for the cast line to whip horizontally towards Ryushi.

Ryushi has dispelled Daoyang in the scant seconds he has available. Holding the head toward Octavian, he points a finger at the demon lord. "We will meet again," he shouts. He vaults skyward, evading the claws of the approaching lesser demons by only a few feet.

The swordsman lands on the ship's deck and collapses. He smiles wanly at Tanuki, holding up the head. "We've done it."

The Sun's Messenger bursts into an even greater light, radiating with the brilliance of the Unconquered Sun, magnifying the anima banners of those inside so that the whole field is lit up as if it were day. With one last turn Meggan brings the ship to bear, focusing her firepower against the enemies in the air and decimating their ranks with shot after shot. Even in the midst of all this noise and light, Kitty sits in the window, placidly watching the noise below between grooming licks of its front paws. "That was fun!" comes the warm voice from the painting. The archivist slowly pushes himself to his feet, smiles strangely at Ryushi, and then faints.

Tanuki sets down the painting carefully on the deck, and sighs at the hapless archivist. "Poor bastard," he remarks. "Lucky bastard, though. He made it outa this alive."

As Meggan races away from the Blessed Isle the Solars can look back and see that the airships have resumed fire. It's harder to tell just who is winning, but with the air in the Realm's control, it seems fairly clear that things are going to be far more balanced than before.

---

The Outer Sea races beneath the keel of the _Sun's Messenger_. While the others attend to their own business or look on, Ryushi kneels before the painting, propped up against a wall of the ship. He stares at the girl depicted, waiting for long moments before speaking. Finally, the fearless warrior gathers his courage. "Tell me your story," he says.

"My story?" asks the woman softly. Her laugh is a gentle one, and the painting's focus shifts with her as she sits on the beach. "I suppose it has been a long time, and you've changed a great deal since that day." She looks out over the rolling waves, stretching herself out before she begins to tell her story.

"My name is Alissa, though mortals gave me other names. The Lady of the Rising Sun, the Singer of Many Dawns, and others besides. My father is Lord Heron the Wise, who serves only Helios himself. My mother is The Woman of Silent Peace, faithful of the Maiden of Serenity." She looks out over the waves and shuts her eyes, clearly very comfortable. "You thought I was a brat when we first met. I was so very spoiled, and everyone fawned over me during the Festival of Calibration. Every year for a century I was pampered and sang to. Until you came and changed everything. Until the insurrection that destroyed everything."

Ryushi listens intently, curious to learn everything. For so long he has dreamed of this girl, preparing to speak, and now that she has words, he can think of nothing else.

"You were quiet then, too," says Alissa. She pauses, looking thoughtfully out over the waters. "You probably wonder why I came to be like this." She sprawls out on her back with a sigh. "It was a friend of ours who made this painting. When things looked their worst, and every life was seen to be in danger, this paradise was made for me. This refuge that could pass unharmed through the ages was created. Of course, there was a price to be paid. While this will keep me safe against brigands and usurpers, it also holds me. I can only be released when this painting is brought to the proper place. I do not know now how difficult that will be. I haven't seen a map in centuries."

"Tell me of this place," Ryushi says immediately. His next goal has begun to crystallize in his mind. "We will find it."

Tanuki settles beside Meggan, helping with the important duty of petting Kitty as he listens to Alissa's tale. He has nothing to say right now - this is Ryushi's quest. But he is content to follow along for now - it's a hell of a story, and there's no way he'd miss the best parts.

"It was to the west of Luthe by three hundred leagues. A bit north, as well," explains Alissa. "The name has likely changed, but we called it the Dawnbringer Island. It was beautiful and rugged. From all over Creation recruits came to be trained there. It was an island meant for creating perfect officers. In those times, this was not just a matter of martial prowess, but of the spirit and mind. They would learn more than the arts of war, but also the techniques of healers and the philosophies of justice and mercy. It was critical to know not just how to direct force, but when and why to do so. I weep thinking of those men and women dying as they fought each other. They were more than students. They were like children to me."

"We know of Luthe, though it rests beneath the waves now," Ryu says.

"A pity," whispers Alissa. "The city of Admiral Leviathan deserved better." She looks sadly at the sky, slowly shutting her eyes. "I have waited so long. I began to wonder if I would ever be free again. Sometimes I even doubted if being free again would be a blessing. So much that I've loved has been lost. Even for me, there comes a point where the pain is simply too great to bear."

Ryushi smiles quietly. "Tanuki and I have come from different places. We are alike in that we fought for those who were important to us. For Tanuki, it is Meggan, who has a sort of freedom now. We will still fight further. If she can be given sight, we will do it. For myself, it is you. I will fight to free you."

Tanuki nods. This, at least, is a point on which the Trickster has feelings of his own. "It's all bout freedom," he says. "Long as ya can't go where ya please an' do what ya think is right, that's somethin' I gotta do somethin about."

"Then I will not lose hope," replies Alissa. "One day we will walk on these shores again. I want to hear your full story then. You are not the same as you were, but in the ways that matter, you are not so different." She looks out over the waters again, "I should rest. As should you. You have chosen a battle with a foe worthy of your attention and he will not forget. Even in the past few were so strong as to take the wrath of Octavian lightly."

"We will rest. But I must know." Ryushi frowns. "Alissa.. the Usurpation, as it is known. Or the righteous vengeance of the Dragon-Blooded on the demons of old. No story can be trusted except that told by one who witnessed it all. Am I god or monster?"

Alissa sighs softly and shakes her head, "You put me to a cruel question," she whispers. "There were some who did turn to madness. But they were still good people. Proud and beautiful, strong and righteous, and yet the world wore on them, it devoured their minds and twisted all that was glorious in their hearts. There was something wrong, and by the time it was clear it was already too late." Her voice falls to a murmur, "But it may not have been too late, had those who struck the Lawgivers down instead aided those who were in pursuit of a cure. It is foolish to expect either side of this to be right. Both sides had their virtues, and yet only one was conciously born of pride."

"It is a difficult question, but the fate of the world rests on it. If I am a monster, better that I destroy myself now," Ryushi says, his words full of conviction. "But if such tragedy need not repeat itself, then I will remake the world in my image. I and my fellows."

All this is going over Tanuki's head. The idea that remaking the world might be in his hands is still slow to penetrate. "Long as this new world o' yours understands that people ain't things, you got my support," he remarks. If he _is_ to be a shaper of Creation, there are a few simple principles that will guide his hand.

"The Realm has lost the Mandate of Heaven. We must earn it back," Ryu says. "Alissa, help us. Keep us from pride."

Alissa laughs gently, "My dear, of all the things you might request of me, that is the most unnecessary." She is pleased now, though her words are serious. "I was always willing to keep your head its correct size. There is something I think you should know though. Come near the painting and I will show you something." She moves along the beach, and the painting's focus is directed towards the wet sand. Alissa begins to draw in it with her fingers. From the first, it is clear she is drawing a map.

"The world you know," she says quietly. The map is not quite correct. There are places on it that are not known anymore, wide swaths of land swallowd by chaos. She goes on, drawing still more and more, until the map stretches no less than four times the size that she started with. "The World that was taken from the Solars." She says gently, "Now tell me, do you have any choice but to fight against the wave that would swallow the whole world? Would you not face the possibility of madness when the alternative is set before your eyes?"

"If I am a child of the Sun, then is it not my duty to fight for the sake of the world?" asks Ryushi. "If something must be reclaimed, am I not the one charged with doing it?"

Maragal frowns at the map. He looks to Megara, who nods. "So it is as I thought. Creation: it's land, Moon, Sun, and Stars, are all dying," she says quietly.

"Wait, that can't be right," says Tanuki, finally "You mean the world's _shrunk_? It can't do that! It... it's the world, it can't _do_ that. ...Can it?" he asks, looking at Ryushi and Maragal and Megara.

"You are yourself," says Alissa to Ryushi. "You must do what you feel is right. Know that you were chosen by the greatest and most powerful of the Gods. The Unconquered Sun, Lord Helios rules with wisdom and justice. He would not smile upon you if you were not fit."

Megara looks at Tanuki with a frown. "The world of order was thrust in the teeth of chaos. There is at its border a gnawing mouth that does not sleep and cannot be tamed. Where it comes, true madness reigns. Land turns to soup, air to snakes, water to fire. Even your body will dissolve in the face of its power. Yet there is a greater power yet. It is a power that is hidden and buried under countless lies." Megara is savoring this revelation. "Only in the most hidden of sites can I find stories of it, but now I know beyond doubt that it is real. The Adamant Circle, the power for which the Empress herself strived and failed to achieve. She could never hope to master it, because only one group was trusted with its mastery: the Chosen of Helios, the Anathema of the Sun. Even their kin the Chosen of Luna could not gain access to the Third Circle."

Ryushi nods. "Then the world will shrink no more. We will hold it fast against the demons, against the Wyld, against whatever threatens it." He looks directly at Tanuki. "You have been chosen for your own reasons. But I ask you to join me in this." And he turns to Megara. "I have found what I seek, with your help. Our partnership is now at an end. You must now decide if you wish to cast your lot with the Solar Exalted, or go your own way. But if whatever it is you seek will aid Creation, I will help you."

Megara answers the question with more of her forbidden knowledge. "The Sun, the Moon, and the Stars rule the heavens. Of these two are spoken of as having servants on earth. Helios the Unbeatable and Luna the Ever-Changing. These are the Anathema, who once were rightful rulers of Creation. In the power of Helios comes courage, nobility, righteousness. In the power of Luna comes wild passion, unfettered freedom, and the wisdom of the gray that lies between light and darkness. Yet what of the stars? Their might guides the future. Where are their Chosen?" It bothers her to think of this. "I will follow the Chosen of Helios the Unconqured, the Unwavering."

"In the absence of the Chosen of Luna and Helios, men have grown weak and petty, our strength fails. We do not recall what real courage is, confusing it with despair." Megara shakes her head, "But our eyes have been opened. I saw those men in the battle today. They will not forget, nor will I, that it was not the power of the Dragons that gave them courage. It was not our willpower that stood fearless before the might of Octavian. That was the power of the Unconquered Sun." She looks to Maragal, who laughs at the question in her eyes. "As if there were a doubt? I will follow you, my Lords, and I will do all that is in my power to aid you in restoring Creation. I will remind you of the smaller people in this world and hold any madness at bay."

Ryushi smiles. He turns to regard the blind girl, and speaks more gently than the tones of conviction he used earlier. "Meggan, will you fly us to where Ami is? I think that we will need her next."

Meggan nods and smiles, "Of course. Oh, and I'm not going anywhere, either. You are my family now, and I won't leave you when you still need my help. Besides, it wouldn't be any fun on my own." For his part, Kitty just wanders over to Tanuki and rubs his cheek at the Solar's hand, demanding some more petting. Meggan guides the ship higher, and she moves even faster than she has before. Her bonding with the ship must be growing stronger with time.

The journey is still a long one. Meggan is taking care to avoid drawing any attention, and Megara is taking the time to talk to the blind girl, feeding her information on city after city that might pose a danger and telling her snippets of myth and old prose that has survived. The scholar is acting far more human than she was when the Solars first encountered her.

The city that the Solars left was a mostly-broken wreck, a derelict machine that was barely able to still function. This time, their approach finds a place undergoing a hasty reconstruction. All around the city glints of moving metal can be seen. The mirrors are functioning as they always had, but there's a new feature. A pair of great geysers erupt every few seconds by the cluster of factory cathedrals, and pipes of golden fire can be seen feeding those great buildings. As Meggan guides the ship in a docking bay swings open, illuminated by flashing blue lights that are clearly visible even in the desert sunlight.

Even a Solar can feel impressed. While he has rescued the portrait of a trapped god in the same amount of time, Ryushi cannot claim that he has resurrected a First Age city and its works. He must pay his compliments to Ami, he decides.

Tanuki laughs. "Damn, did she clean this place up or what?" he says, grinning broadly. "Wow!" For a moment, he's like a kid again, gaping at the spectacle of a restored wonder of the First Age. How more awed he would be, one wonders, if he were to believe that the original was even more spectacular yet.

The Sun's Messenger lands gracefully. The last time, it was met very poorly, with a broken console. This time the Solars and their allies find themselves face to face with.. something. A thing of metal gears and incredibly complex tracts of wires walks out to meet them. Several appendages extend out from it, and it's clear it is surveying them. "Greetings Ryushi and Tanuki and Meggan and Kitty and unknown guests." The archivist, who finally was coaxed into introducing himself as Gratu nearly faints again. "You are welcomed by Ami of the Burning Spire. You have access to all safe levels and are welcome to survey the greater works. I am Clockwork Six-Two-Fourteen and Spheroid Ten-Six-Eleven will be assisting me in guiding you wherever you wish to go. Before that can be done, however, Ami of the Burning Spire requests you come to her workshop and speak with her." A brief pause and Six-Two-Fourteen adds helpfully, "And Spheroid Ten-Six-Eleven should be built by the time we are finished there."

Burning Spire's streets are alive with creatures like Six-Two-Fourteen. Their shapes are all different, however, and as the Solars pass a greater machine it suddenly folds in on itself, coming to a stop only to be swarmed over by hundreds upon hundreds of smaller, spiderlike machines. When the swarm is finished and moves on, they leave behind three smaller machines. These work on the finer details of the construction that the larger machine had been working-on.

The factory cathedrals are now in full operation. The roaring of the great geysers is like the beating of a heart, and with every eruption a shower of sparks rains down from above. The path the Solars take is shielded by a metal so thin that they can look through it like glass. "This is.. incredible!" cries out Gratu. "Impossible! Amazing!" Maragal reaches out to poke the man, "We know."

Meggan has come with the others this time, and though she cannot see what is happening around her, she can hear it, and feel the excitement in kitty. She trusts Tanuki to guide her safely as always, but here there is little need. When Maragal pauses to inspect some of the work a machine moves right over to him, "Please maintain a safe distance from the sparkfall." As soon as he steps back it races off to see to some other task.

The factory cathedral's true glory is not revealed from outside, but within. In a workshop that would be large enough for twenty blacksmiths only one artisan works. But Ami has changed and become far greater than any other smith of this age. She sits in a great throne that towers above the workshop. One her hands she wears gauntlets of orichalcum and thousands of fine wires tumble from them. At every bench a device of gears and wire works, all of them connected by those golden wires to Ami. From time to time, a surge of essence races down a wire and a greater glow of blue and white engulfs a worker.

Ryushi enters the factory-cathedral a changed man, a god-king who has but to claim his kingdom. He regards Ami now as an ally, an equal, despite the clear mastery the Twilight has attained here. "I salute your accomplishments," he says.

Tanuki has no words to describe, or even understand, what he is seeing All he can say is, "Now that's a puppet show."

With so many things to distract her, Ami is finally slowed down to a reasonable speed. "You have done well. You come with strange allies, but they are welcome in our city." The Solar artisan bows her head slightly to the friends of the Ryushi and Tanuki. "As you can see, I am rather busy at the moment, but I will send a Spheroid with you who shall be my voice as you explore the city. It will be able to tell all that I know and explain the projects we are working on at the moment." On the walls by every bench schematics are plastered and worklists compiled that show how much remains to be done. A console rises to the left of Ami and she directs her attention towards it. Rather than operate it with her fingers, she does so with her thoughts, information streaming past at a rate even Megara might find dizzying.

Ami goes on, saying, ""You should avoid the main gate until sundown. The workers there are not optimized for safety. You can watch their work from the northern square or the Gardens of Rain. The project at the main gate is the greatest yet. I think you will find it quite pleasing. Oh, and if you have any special requests, please enter them with the Clockworks or with a console so it can enter the usual task cycle."

The Gardens of Rain are aptly named. In the midst of the desert, in this city of brow-beating heat, a thousand square paces has apparently been reinforced with supernatural power to have regular downpours twice per day. Under the leaves it is cooler and the Solars and their allies can sit and watch a construction so vast that it challenges the very imagination. "It is called the Alphapolis," explains the Spheroid. "When it is ready, it will travel twenty miles to the north, divert its power to drones, and slowly be broken down to build a city as large as this one.
