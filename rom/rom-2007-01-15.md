For Ryushi, Alphapolis is a wonder in the making, a city run under the control of one Solar engineer. For Eliara, a Lunar for whom the first age is a living memory, it is more bittersweet, and in a way, like a turned grave. She frowns thoughtfully at her surroundings, noting, "Too familiar and too different."

"Things change," Ryu replies with a hint of amusement in his voice. He speaks to a shapeshifter, but he does not mean insult by it.

Tanuki glances briefly at Eliara but says nothing, still trying to become accustomed to her presence, and to the notion that she knew this place in the First Age.

"You might say that," says Eliara. "But in changing, they are exactly the same, as well." The Lunar finds her little joke amusing, if a bit pitiful. "So this is how the next Realm will begin? It's rather strange, to have cities that build cities, but for no people."

Ryushi looks around the cityscape with a detached expression. "Not while we still bear the name 'Anathema'. It's up to Tanuki and myself to cleanse the stain of shame from our name. Then they will come."

"It is good you remember that your crown was broken for a reason," replies Eliara. She sounds gruff, but pleased. "We can only hope that this time things turn for the better, rather than the worse. The horrors of the First Age cannot be bourne again. Creation would not survive."

"My ambitions are simple," Ryu smiles. "I do not expect Creation. I wish only for an island. An island that does not exist."

"What you accepted will give you little choice," answers Eliara sadly. "It is not for you, nor for I, to make our homes where we wish. Even the old will not forget whom we serve." She looks to Ryushi unblinkingly and says, "Tell me of the island that is not yet an island."

The warrior nods. "Come. Alissa awaits."

Eliara follows Ryushi to the tower where the painting is looking out over the city. Though Ami has spent a great deal of time talking with Alissa, she is not present when the others arrive. Upon seeing the painting, Eliara arches an eyebrow. "The work of the Lawgivers," she murmurs. Her reactions are hard to read, but it is clear she's not comfortable. As for Alissa, she is polite and friendly as ever, greeting Eliara with a curious mixture of words and gestures. Eliara grows more relaxed after seeing this and replies with only a slight nod. "The old welcomes were the best and most honest," she notes.

"Alissa has told me of an island where she may be freed of the painting," Ryu explains, briefly summarizing. "It was lost to the Wyld. I will reclaim it. But.. I do not know how."

"You only want the island that does not exist," murmurs Eliara. She has to laugh at this, and it takes her some time to regain herself. "What you desire is possible, but it is far from a simple task. You would force order in the teeth of chaos. To do this the Solars of old would use the power of the Adamant Circle or other magics no less spectacular."

Ryushi nods. "I've learned the Terrestrial Circle - Dragon-Blooded magic. If there are larger spheres of power, I'll learn them too if I must."

"It is not their magic!" hisses Eliara, sounded scandalized. "They could not even reach the powers they had were it not for those greater than they are. The Chosen of the Dragons! They are children fumbling with the tools of their parents." Still, the fit does not distract her for long. "I can help you achieve the next step on your journey, but the last lies beyond my reach. Among all the Chosen, only the Lawgivers have ever had the right to the Adamant Circle. All the fools who have tried to defy this absolute barrier have paid a terrible price."

"I feel that might is not enough. I need knowledge as well." Ryushi frowns. "Will sorcery simply grant my desire, or must I know more about the Wyld?"

"To use the sorcery you will have to know a great deal about the Wyld," replies Eliara. "To reach the Adamant Circle your knowledge of essence must grow so that it matches mine. It is not just a matter of power, but control. The circles of sorcery grow more dangerous with each step. The steps are not even, however. The gap between Adamant and Sapphire are like the shores of the great sea."

"'You grasp a blade with no handle,'" quotes Ryushi, remembering the lessons of Megara. "I'm certainly not going to turn away from danger now." He walks, pacing the hallway where Alissa's painting hangs, his bootheels clicking on the flawless stone. "What else must I do? Is there a god of the island I must find, make, or appease?"

"If there was a god, he's dead," replies Eliara. "Or if he's very unlucky, and he's a beggar on the streets of Yu-Shan, doing anything for a scrap that might keep him coherent a few more years. You'd be amazed.." She smirks then and says, "You haven't seen it, have you?"

Ryushi shakes his head, glancing at Tanuki as well.

Tanuki shakes his head. "Yu-Shan?" he asks.

"The Eternal City, Heaven," replies Eliara. "It is where the gods dwell. In better times, it is where the Chosen of the Maidens would carry out the will of Deliberative. Now, it is a dying city, but it will not die until Creation dies."

Ryushi's face darkens. "That will not happen," he mutters.

Eliara laughs, though her visage is grim, "No. No, it will not. Since the fall of the true Realm, my people have fought and died in wave upon wave to see that there would be another day, another harvest, another year of life. The traitors who stole the Blessed Isle were protected as well, though we wished to let them die. Now it seems that the Lawgivers have returned. Perhaps it is your duty to kill them for us."

"Their demons seem to do the job for us," remarks Ryu. "I've told you that tale." He nods to the painting.

"Yes, the barriers," replies Eliara. "I've heard a lot of strange whispers about this." She frowns, "It is not a good sign. The fact that I'm not sure of its cause should tell you something, if you have been listening."

Ryushi nods. "Once again, a task for the Lawgivers."

"Exactly. The original pact, if legends are to be believed, was with a Solar," says Eliara. "Have you heard of Brighid before? I imagine that it has been perverted by the Realm, but that old story they might fear to meddle with too greatly."

Ryushi shakes his head.

"Then let it be your first lesson," answers Eliara. She's a bit annoyed that Ryushi wasn't taught the tale, but at the same time, she's pleased to be the one sharing it.

"When the world was old, but not quite so old as this, the Lawgivers entered Creation. They were blessed with great gifts and powers, and they were a wonder to all those living. Every Solar had great power in one sphere or another. All except for one, who was curiously weak and had no gifts to rival those of her brothers and sisters."

"To be given the blessing of Helios and yet have no great talent was a trauma and a source of shame." Eliara sighs softly, "Confronted with this misery, the Solar fled from her people, travelling the distant corners of the world in a search for her place. Yet her quest found no answer for her, and finally, overcome with despair, she collapsed in the ices of the north, weeping bitterly."

Eliara sighs softly, "But there was one who watched from afar who took pity upon this child and came to her air. The Yozi Princess came to her, for in those days there was great friendship between their kind and ours. The Yozi Priness granted to Brigid the knowledge of sorcery, the mastery of shaping essence beyond that of her kin. When she returned, she was at last able to stand tall among her own people, and she wore a great mantle of blue that was given to her by the Yozi Princess, woven of the tears of the Solar and the hair of the Yozi."

"It was Brigid who then made the first books of magic, and from her teaching the great schools of sorcery began," explains Eliara. "She is the reason that sorcery came to be. At least according to the legends." It's obvious the No Moon believes them. "It seems likely. Few stories praise the generosity of the Yozis, and yet we know that we were not always their masters, nor they our slaves or enemies."

Ryushi digests this slowly. "Then.. the demons traded their service to Brighid. For what in return?"

"According to the legend, it was not service offered," says Eliara. "In those days, the Yozis and the Chosen were not yet enemies, but friends. Still, it is hard to believe that there was no price." She frowns and suggests, "Perhaps we see now the price coming in our age? Or perhaps it is totally unrelated."

"Very well." Ryushi paces a bit more, then stops as a thought strikes him. "The Lawgivers. You've said much of what we've done, what we must do. What of the Lunars? What is your place?"

"We survive and teach others to survive," replies Eliara. "Unlike the Solars, the Lunars can change quickly, adapting swiftly to any challenge and finding a way to live through it. As things stand now, we are the only reason Creation is not devoured by the Wyld." She lids her eyes and notes, "Yet it is not all we do. We gather armies, for our hate of the Realm burns brightly and we long for the day of vengeance."

"The Lawgivers will not forget," Ryu promises quietly. "Very well. I know no wisdom but that of my dreams, which command me to free Alissa. For this I need the power of the Solars' sorcery. I must learn of the Wyld - if you will not do this for me then I will find another Lunar. The Realm, and the Abyss, are the two foes I must vanquish."

"To defeat either, you must have a strong arm ready to hold back the Wyld that is the enemy of both, as well," replies Eliara. "We will do this, because it is what we do. If you mean to regain the right of Solar Sorcery, you will need to find one of the great tomes. I will aid you in this, but I am a No Moon. My caste is the well of truth, we remember the old tales as they were before the Chosen of the Maidens twisted them. I am not a fool who will charge into the places you must go, because I know better. The greatest Solar legacies know their masters and will not tolerate intrusion of any but their own."

The swordsman smiles. "I'll be the fool for all of us then."
