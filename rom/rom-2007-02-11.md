Ryushi has his firedust. The _Sun's Messenger_ was loaded to the gills with the stuff. Now he needs three more things: a buccaneer, a builder, and a god.

He speaks to Wavecutter, explaining his strategy. He will need a fleet of fast ships capable of hauling as much cargo as possible - a light, rapid attack force. He does not expect the sailors to see combat, of course.

He speaks to Ami as well, outlining his requirements: automata that can quickly haul and carry, and that can follow instructions. They will not need to attack or defend themselves; they are there to provide as much transportation as they possibly can.

Finally, he has a request of Eliara. "Find me a god, or a demigod, who can travel quickly underwater. Daoyang and I will do the rest. I simply need transportation."

Ryushi stands aboard one of Wavecutter's interceptors. It is a small, fast ship intended for the very purpose he now needs - reconnaissance. He has a spyglass ground of the finests southern sands by Varangian astrologiers and Chiaroscuran glassmakers, and with a prayer to Eagle inscribed on it by a ranking theurge of Chiaroscuro. Its value is considerable, but it yields every detail he needs to see.

The waves around the Heptagram are patrolled by exactly forty ships divided perfectly into two patrols that maneuver safely away from the shore as if they were spoiling for a fight. To Ryushi's trained eye, what lies before him reads as easy as a book. "That's the Intervention's group," notes a wizened sailor. She explains as Ryushi sees what her eyes certainly cannot, "I heard tell that the House Ledaal was going to put some of her ships out. On account of the other groups being off busy south of here, it has to be. Can ye see it?" The sailor says nothing of the second fleet, however.

Through the glass, Ryushi's perfect eyes can read the bell of the greatest of Ledaal's ships. It is the Intervention, and her crew looks nervous, despite the steady expression of the tall man who must be the captain. Positioned clearly against that fine vessel is a ship called Reclaimant, with a scowling captain and the colors of House Mnemon. Pointedly, there is also a device upon it that was born only by those who served the Scarlet Empress herself.

Past the ships and on the shore, the Dawn sees no sign of great encampment. There are only two small pitches of tents, positioned well apart with the sprawl of the Heptagram lying between them. It doesn't take much to see that the Heptagram already is a powderkeg waiting to explode. The fires the Solar has brought may be just the thing to send the whole damn place ablaze in more ways than one.

Ryushi nods. "We have two immediate objectives then," he says. "First, we are going to sabotage Mnemon's fleet. Lacquered firedust kegs should be waterproof for long enough, and we'll need to light them to sink those ships. Our second immediate objective... is to acquire the Reclaimant's colors. Get that flag."

The sailor laughs at this, "Now tha's a party I've ben waitin' my whole life for." Wavecutter smirks and directs her attention to the horizon. She speaks to Ryushi with more than a little excitement in her voice. "So the Reclaimant is here, eh? I'd not weep to see that one get swallowed by the deeps."

"I have no love for Mnemon myself," murmurs Ryushi. The vaguest of memories tug at him, those dealing with life on the Blessed Isle itself as a young child. He dismisses them from his mind. "Once Wavecutter's satisfied that her fleet can position itself for loading operations, we attack."

"What's in yer head for the fleet of Ledaal, then?" asks Wavecutter. "Or do we mean to go in quiet like while the two friends over there sort themselves out?"

Ryu points out across the beach of the Isle of Voices. "When they see the Mnemon ships go up, but not their own, they'll guess sabotage or attack. My first goal, if I were the admiral, would be to find an attacker I could pin this on. I'd thought to leave this part to you, but if you want my suggestions..."

"Our saboteur must get away under the water. That means the only ones following from Ledaal's fleet, and Mnemon's survivors, will be the water-aspects. Run up Mnemon's flag - I trust you can muster that, Madam Pirate - and sail toward the Heptagram. If we bring aboard any mortal survivors, put them to the sword. Dragon-Blooded, I'll deal with."

"When they see us looting the Heptagram, the Ledaal captain can make his own guesses. I'd imagine that he'll tell his superiors that House Mnemon just sacrificed some of the Imperial Legions to 'appropriate' more sorcery for themselves."

"So I guess the simmer will be roasting," murmurs Wavecutter. "Well, let's be about our business. We'll get the colors up and move on in as you say. Sun knows it'll be one 'ell of a mess before Luna's up."

Tanuki balances a throwing knife, point first, on his finger, as he dons his gill cloak with his free hand. "Sounds like we got a plan. All ye need's someone who c'n swim under water an' not be seen by yon scouts when he goes to plant yer charges." He grins broadly, flipping the knife into the air and catching it between his teeth.

"Don't be getting yerself killed," says Wavecutter. "And don't ferget your trip can be shortened a bit by that ship o' yers. Now I wouldn't say get it too close, but you don't have to be swimming this far."

---

Tanuki's gill cloak ripples behind him as the young Night Caste pushes off from the _Sun's Messenger_ and glides silently beneath the Mnemon fleet, woven-reed fins upon his feet the only other accoutrement he needs, along with the uncanny aptitudes given to him by Helios, to cruise beneath the waves in a way that would make the Lintha jealous. And after a fashion, it is the tactics of the Lintha that Tanuki is now emulating.

As the shadow of a Mnemon vessel looms over Tanuki, he swims directly upward, staying in its shadow and surfacing near the stern, ahead of the rudder mechanism. Two throwing knives pierce the leather straps attached to the firedust keg and wedge into cracks between the hullboards, fixing the keg firmly in place just below the waterline. The keg is not large - no bigger than Tanuki's forearm - but the blast will still open a great hole in the vessel, and wreck the rudder into the bargain. Even if it does not sink right away, it will be deadly crippled, and a sitting duck for any ship that's whole.

Satisfied, the saboteur Trickster ducks beneath the waves again, staying in the shadow again until he disappears into the murk, then returning to the _Sun's Messenger_ for another armful of casks before making his way to the next hapless Mnemon galleon, a silent shadow of death to all who sail against the Chosen of the Unconquered Sun.

Cloaked by the power of his anima banner, Tanuki is all but invisible to the watchmen who patrol the railings of the Mnemon vessels. The few sharp-eyed individuals who happen to look in the right direction at just the wrong moment to get a glimpse of him stare blankly at the stern for a few seconds, then shrug and continue on their way, convinced in their own minds that their eyes were playing tricks. None but the most powerful of personages can perceive the Daggers of Heaven when they do not want to be seen.

And thus, without the alarm being raised even once, every Mnemon vessel set to defend the Heptagram is silently set on the path to destruction. His mission complete, Tanuki swims back down to the _Sun's Messenger_, and waves and grins broadly at one of the sensors, then gets a firm grip on the railings with both hands and both feet. Inside, Meggan grins to herself at his antics and sets the Solar vessel on its return trip, speeding off as fast as she can without Tanuki being pulled loose from the hull - and since it's Tanuki, that's still making good time.

Back at Wavecutter's fleet, the watchmen are briefly surprised by something small and man-sized rocketing out of the water ahead of them - but relax when it becomes clear that it's just Tanuki, showing off again. He somersaults in mid-air and lands on both feet, dripping wet, on the deck in front of Wavecutter. If the Solar captain is impressed, she doesn't show it - instead, simply rolling her eyes and saying, "Boys."

Ryushi, as ever, gets right to the point. "Are we ready?" Tanuki grins, and wordlessly hands a glass cylinder to the Solar swordsman. The cylinder is engraved with orichalcum inlay, which links it sympathetically to similar cylinders embedded in the firedust casks. Ryushi nods, and tosses the cylinder into the air, putting his hand to his twin sword hilts. The cylinder lands as a myriad of glass rings...

And a few seconds later, the explosions echo across the water as the fleet of House Mnemon erupts into flame.

Wavecutter lifts a glass to see just what has been achieved. "A bad day to be sailing under those colors," she muses. It is not one by one, but all at once that the fleet of Mnemon is blasted, one of the smallest, most agile of the ships actually lifting into the air, it's keel broken in two.

"A pity." Wavecutter hardly means it, though. She turns the glass, looking at Ledaal and she barks a laugh. "Nobility ain't dead, it's just resting." The ships of Ledaal swing into action immediately, some rushing to sea, others moving in on the burning fleets. As Wavecutter watches, she tsks, "Ledaal eggheads don't know much. All heart, nothing upstairs."

Wavecutter hands over the glass, so Tanuki and Ryushi can both have a look. What they see are the ships of Ledaal moving in to try and rescue injured and drowning sailors and those same sailors fighting their would-be rescuers, obviously thinking that they have been betrayed. "Bloody hornet's nest over there, mates." She turns back, "Let's be about! Raise those colors! We've work to do!" She looks to Ryushi, "I think it's time to see if you are terribly clever or terribly mad. Either way, there's life to be had out there."

The interceptor fleet begins sailing across the waters, making good time. Ryushi spends his time with Megara's charts and notes of the Heptagram, instructing Ami's automata in their duties and tasks. He is no organizer, merely an instigator, but he has a mountain of talent on which to build.

He counts the stocks of firedust that remain. The layout of the school of sorcery includes some details on where to place these charges; as the burning remnants of Mnemon's fleet indicates, a timed detonation is easy to accomplish. All the strike force must do is be outside before it happens.

When the Solars reach the shore, they pass near a pitched battle, as the forces of the two small camps clash. It's immediately apparent that all those left alive are Dragon Blooded, and they are both very focused and quite good in the arts of war. "Damn fine mess that is," mutters a sailor. "We'll be wantin' na part of that, I tell ye." For the moment, at least, the battling factions have not noticed the approach of a new ship.

Ryushi leaps from the ship and lands soft-footed on the shore, with Eliara right behind him. He dashes straight for the wide doors that mark the seaward loading entrance of the school. Ahead of him are two armed men, axes drawn, brows sweaty from stress and confusion and fear. The onrushing warrior assumes his best voice of command: "You men! House Mnemon is attacked! We have to secure the Heptagram! Open up!"

The two men are frazzled, indecisive. For a moment they look to each other, and then the man on the left shrugs. The other turns to open the door. "We need to get to the camp. It'll be on you to keep the door!" he says hastily. He pushes the door open and then flips the keys to Eliara. The Lunar catches them with an arched eyebrow. As the two men race off she mutters, "You damnable Solars are lucky as ten foxes."

"Let's see what the henhouse holds, eh?" Ryushi answers with a smile, moving into the Heptagram.

---

Ryushi concerns himself with the offices of the senior officials of the Heptagram. The more common areas, particularly the libraries, he leaves to Ami's talented and sophisticated clockwork creatures.

One innovation the Twilight developed, for example, is a thing that resembles a crustacean with three eyes on stalks. On its back, at the center of the "carapace", is an armored hemisphere holding a radiant blue crystal. The crawlers stampede into the Solutimat Wing of the library and begin knocking books and scroll cases from their shelves with abandon. Their brethren behind them unfurl scrolls or crack open bound tomes. Their third eye glimmers, acquiring the writing found on the page or parchment. On their back, the crystal - a memory crystal, such as found in First Age libraries - starts to acquire the text of the book.

A few of the crabs have the power to sense Essence at work. For some books, where a simple transcription might lose the more subtle benefit of a book with actual enchantments, they crack their metal shells open and toss the book into a hollow holding chamber beneath.

Elsewhere, animated bronze spiders topple bookshelves with powerful forelimbs, then scuttle in a half-turn and begin spinning threads of silk to trap the disordered pile of books into a web. They skitter out of the Heptagram and down toward the ship, bumpily towing their haul behind them.

The work of looting the Heptagram is both efficient and effective. With Megara's guidance, Ryushi is able to quickly move from place to place. Her suggestion was fairly simple: "If it looks good, throw it in a sack and we'll figure it out." Items that look like blades but aren't sharp are tossed in with pens that stand on tip, waiting to be commanded. Crystals and gems and small baubles of every magical material are gathered. There is only one rule that is kept rigidly: only Eliara may touch those things made of Moonsilver.

As the Solar and Lunar move through the Heptagram they are often able to divert the guards, but in a one case the men stand fast, challenging Ryushi to provided the proper codewords of the day before they will unbar the door. Before the Solar is given a chance to do anything about it, Eliara unbars the door in a more direct way: by grabbing each of the men in one of her powerful hands and with a sudden, violent motion slamming them through the wall on either side of the locked door.

The Lunar then walks through one of the holes, unbars the door and opens it for Ryushi with a grin. She makes an exaggerated gesture of welcome to Ryushi and says, "This way, sir, this way."

The Dawn Caste has settled accounts in most of the areas he mapped out with Megara, and for now he's satisfied. Scooping up what looks interesting in the chmaber Eliara 'opened', he turns and begins heading for the exit. Along the way he watches many of the automata do likewise. "Evacuation order!" he tells them, knowing they will pass word along to their 'comrades'. Down to the beach and out to the waiting ships he hurries, eyes darting from side to side to ascertain the state of the internecine strife.

As Ryushi moves towards the ship, he sees a scene transformed. The forces of Ledaal and Mnemon have ceased fighting, and those ships that are still functional are in formation. Wavecutter's ship stands separately, and it looks as if there's about to be a very lop-sided naval battle. Before the Dawn can get that far, he comes across an old man in a flowing, black robe. "You have caused enough trouble, young man," he says flatly. "Your foolishness ends here." A blade of some odd, dark metal suddenly appears in the hands of the old man and he charges the Solar. At Ryushi's side, Eliara's body shifts and warps, replaced by that of a towering beast of scale and fang, mingling horribly the features of a snake and human.

Daoyang springs into golden life in Ryushi's hands. "What you call trouble, I call justice," he answers, bringing his weapon to bear.
