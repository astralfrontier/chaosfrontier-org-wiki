"My careful calculations indicate that the removal of precious artifacts and lore exceeded our goals by over .5 percent," says Ami. She has been looking over the items for some time, poking her feet here and there to turn things over with a strange mix of curiousity and boredom. "I imagine that you would rather see the crates though, Ryushi," she says at last. There's a slight undertone of amusement mixed in with the deadpan that tends to come over her voice when she's not speaking of her works.

Ryushi shrugs a little. The warrior is having his ideas of the spirit world and the flows of Essence overturned hourly with each new discovery; he's shielding his turbulent thoughts with a barrier of indifference. "Throwing back the Wyld is what I want. Anything else is at best a tool to that end."

"Of course," replies Ami. "I don't think it's going to be a short matter to do so," she explains. "There may be many, many tools that we need to unlock that painting." The Solar leads the way through the sorted piles where even now hundreds of tiny automata are scrambling to make more perfect arrangements. "You realize we've just kicked off the civil war that will decide who sits on the Scarlet Throne, right? There's going to be endless battles ahead." She pauses a moment and catches Tanuki from the corner of her eye, "You both have to be stronger."

"Such a war was inevitable from the day the regent took the throne," the Dawn counters. "Balas and our troupe knew this was true even a month after news came. Word from the satrapies of the coast had come - they wanted weapons, and they would pay any price. Balas laughed, because he knew that a Scavenger Lord could become rich."

"I just wanted to be sure you were aware of the full implications," replies Ami evenly. "It is important that we weigh our actions with greater care. We don't know who we want to claim that throne, do we? I suggest for now that we coordinate our activities to maintain a busy stalemate. It will give us some room for negotiation in the future."

"From what little I have been told, I doubt this 'Silver Pact' will wait on its haunches for a trio of Solars to decide the political future of the Realm," Ryushi answers doubtfully. "I personally have no need to dictate its future. If you do, then I will of course support you."

"I doubt so as well," replies Ami. "And that brings us back to my point. I assume that we want the Silver Pact to win. That's why I suggest that we do all in our power to encourage a very violent conflict in the Realm. Also, we have reason to believe that these strange Sidereals will interfere with us. We also know they are tied to the Realm. Perhaps if we enfeeble it we can distract them."

This brings the warrior to a stop, and he regards Ami with narrowed eyes. "You have much experience. But you are attempting to draw an unforged blade, Twilight. I know of my limitations. I'm aware of my ignorance. That is why I don't dabble in the Realm's politics, or support a barbarian sweep across the Blessed Isle. Nor do I wish to create emnity with those who are not my enemies."

"I do not know, but do you think it is right that we maintain neutrality in something this major, Ryushi?" Ami is curious, but her questions do not slow her down. She pauses at a crate and gestures at it vaguely, as if expecting it to open on its own. When she realizes the mundane crate will not heed her wishes she tsks. With a slam of her fist the wood is reduced to slivers, packing materials pouring out and revealing something glinting inside. "In any case.. I think this is of some interest to you," she announces.

Ryushi peers at the inside of the crate, curious.

Tanuki, who's been dangling by his toes from a ledge during this debate, watching quietly, bounces off the wall and alights on the edge of the shattered crate, craning to get a closer look.

Ryushi stares curiously. "Ami.. honor demands that I attend to any problem that I become aware of. If I really focus on the Realm's plight, I must solve it.. even if my solution is worse than how it is now.."

"You have honor," replies Ami quietly. "I have logic. I can help you in things of this nature," and here she indicates the contents of the crate, which glints with the telltale golden glow of orichalcum. "But when it comes to the hearts of the living, I can offer little advice. I only know that the Realm is our enemy when it is obvious that once they were our allies." She looks up to Tanuki and points to another crate, "Open that, would you? I think you'll find it useful."

Ryushi reaches in to attempt to haul out the crate's contents.

Tanuki nods and walks around the crate, studying it carefully, then thumping the side in just the right spot to make a panel pop out.

The thing that the Dawn hauls out of its crate is a monumentally heavy piece of golden armor, with flanges and winglets and all manner of strange things. It shimmers and sparkles even in the light of the storage area, and it is unmistakeably a product of the First Age. Experimentally he raps his knuckles against the side of the thing, and the sound it makes is like that of bells chiming the noon hour. He pulls his hand away and rubs it briefly, smiling. "I recognize this," he murmurs to himself, though audibly enough to be heard. "Shaz, you let your armor get stolen, sword-brother..."

Meanwhile, from Tanuki's crate, a billow of red silk emerges from the packing material that spills out of the opened panel. Reaching inside, Tanuki pulls out a bodysuit of thin orichalcum-alloy panels covered by more of the crimson fabric, the occasional auric gleam of orichalcum thread woven into the silk in sigils that, to Ami's eyes, are intermingled with symbols of concealment and the sign of the Maiden of Secrets. The mystic significance of the embroidery is lost on Tanuki, but the function of the suit is not; after a few puzzled seconds of study, his own eyes light up. "You gotta be kiddin me..." he whispers under his breath.

"It makes me wonder what might be concealed in the capital," murmurs Ami. "At the very least, I'd like to find my way into the graces of the Silver Pact for that. Though Eliara is far from a barbarian in the sense the Realm propogandists paint Lunars, many of them may not take the care that a No Moon would. I think it would a horrible tragedy to lose the libraries there."

Ryushi frowns to himself. "Very well," he says at last. "Tanuki? Would you care to don your armor? Ami, come with us. We will need Eliara as well."

Tanuki nods, as he finishes removing the armor - and as he does so, there is a clattering sound from inside the crate, the characteristic ring of orichalcum. Intrigued, Tanuki reaches further in and finds a long flat piece of orichalcum, with a handle on one end and a notch on the other. Tanuki grins, settling it on the crate as he dons the armor. "Comin!" he declares.

"I will let her know," says Ami. She sends the message easily through her city, eyes closing for a moment, then opening once more. "She will not be long. Oh, and it seems that I may have a bargaining chip with the Silver Pact after all. They value Moon Silver as much as we value the sacred metal of our Lord."

Eliara is duly invited to join the Solars, and Ryushi duly explains his plan, in somewhat blunt terms. "The Realm Civil War is a distraction for the Celestials to push their ideologies and distrust on each other. Very well. The Celestial Civil War is a distraction from an issue larger yet - threats to Creation itself. The Deathlords and the incursion of the Shadowlands. The Wyld. The end of all existence. Who sits on the Scarlet Throne will no longer _matter_ after that." He directs himself to Eliara specifically now. "I have no great wish to slay any more Sidereal assassins. Nor do I feel that I have more to prove to the Silver Pact. I have made no demands of either society but that they do not interfere with me. Now it seems that I must make my case more directly. A Sidereal delegation will accompany me to a meeting place. We will deliver what moonsilver we've recovered from the Heptagram to the Pact at that time. I intend to buy the peace I need with logic, and with gifts."

"To do this I need you to help me."

Eliara hears these words with an ear that is attentive and a mind that is open. "I think it is a worthy thing to try, but I do not know if logic alone can achieve it." She sighs and notes, "The Sidereals of this age are very different. I have spoken with very few, but they have woven about them a cloak of such absolute arrogance and certainty that consensus with those not of their kind would almost seem to indicate that act is wrong. They need to be brought to heel eventually. Still, it has been a long time. It will be worth an effort."

Ryushi nods. "I have a truth that perhaps even the arrogance of a god cannot defend against," he says. "We will put it to the test."
