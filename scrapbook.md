# Characters
## Fantasy
I had a dream about a weird pulp-fantasy Summoner character with a crystal eye. She wore an eyepatch over it most of the time, but the eye could be used to summon or conjure fantastic creatures - if she'd seen them with the eye. So her reason for adventuring was to find and confront all these amazing potential summons and thus add their power to her own.

I'm normally a fan of summoners as a character type, but for some reason I always associate "artificial eye as power source" with pulp fantasy specifically. I have no idea why these two things came together.
## Scifi
**Induction tattoos**: do your cyberpunk world's bouncers and bodyguards all have cybernetic arms? Why not something different: specialized tattoos made of conductive ink that allow you to supercharge muscles via electrical induction. Their coats have a power source and double as body armor. When they aren't pushing the PCs around, they're at the gym (or the surgeon), where those induction systems help in bodybuilding and regeneration. It's cheaper to clone new arms than manufacture cyberware, anyway, and what's a bodyguard if not disposable? As a bonus, you can see how jacked your goon is by how much of their skin is covered in the stuff.
## Supers

[The Kingdom and the Throne](scrapbook/kingdom-throne)

**Wolverine clone**: a fierce Norse warrior is denied entry into Valhalla by the Valkyries: "you fight well, it's true, but you do not care a whit for your fellows. You thirst for battle, but you have no place at the table in celebration afterward." So they curse this person with three things: immortality, regeneration, and always-on empathy, to feel the pain and joy of everyone around them. You can add a little offensive power by adding tattooed runes of lightning and stone or the like, to let their body manifest elemental weapons. The result should be a hard-drinking, hard-fighting warrior who'll inevitably be drawn into the emotional lives of those around them. Could be whatever gender you like.

**The Domestic Teleport**: X (fill in name later) discovered an alien artifact buried under their house, exposed by digging in the basement or somesuch. The artifact can lock onto and teleport objects near by - so basically, X can teleport anything that's in their house to another location, and back. Either this is to wherever X is located, or there's some kind of targeting system, or you can send out teleport beacons, or whatever.

So X can equip themselves using anything in the house, but can't teleport anything that won't fit in there, and can't teleport anything back that'll cause problems (so none of this endless-spigots-of-water-from-the-ocean nonsense, or teleporting things into the sun). And X is also facing eviction, or eminent domain claims on the property, or something, that puts long term pressure on them.

**Sam Echevarra** is a professional attorney, and superhuman. She has a variety of super-powers: increased intelligence, enhanced senses, flight, super-durability, and more.

While some super-intelligent supers focus on science or technology, Echevarra devotes her amazing brain power to law. She has an encyclopedic knowledge of the law at different levels. She has devised numerous innovative legal strategies. She has argued in front of the Supreme Court on a few occasions. Her proposals for clarifying amendments to existing law have frequently been accepted by legislators.

Echevarra specializes in prosecuting hard-to-reach crime bosses or influential public figures. She has been both prosecutor and defender. She has successfully repelled several hits on her from the underworld. She has no long-term relationships due to the danger of her job, and often keeps even her coworkers at arm's length to protect them. Despite this social distance, she remains committed to her job.

## Subversions of Superhero Tropes

Character is associated with a huge tech company? Sure - but he's the janitor. He can go anywhere and get access to anything, but he's very limited in what he can make use of without getting caught.

The shadowy government agency building a secret super-tech operative for themselves? Sure, it's the Environmental Protection Agency. Their hardcore robot is able to stop polluters, but also bring back court-admissible evidence of wrongdoing, and the EPA gets funded by the fines they have to pay. This keep's the agency's books black and the Earth green. Everyone wins.

The power-infused soldier on a dark crusade? She's a combat medic, able to heal injuries and cure disease or affliction with a touch. She's fighting a lonely moonlit war against the drug dealers and criminals of the city. Important witness shot and in a coma? She can help. Neighborhood of drug addicts keeping the local pusher funded? His money and power will dry up when they're off the stuff.

The ridiculously buxom and well-built Amazon who's shrouded in mystic mist. She's not a warrior, she's a force of nature, not merely a body but a presence first and foremost. You can occasionally see her outlines in water or fog, but it's the exception rather than the rule.

The muscular, grizzled male hero with a gem for one eye, and wearing dozens of pouches. In each one is a set of cards, or rune stones, or something else that really does justify dozens of separate pouches. He's not a gun-toting cyborg, he's a mage.

Jacques Rabbit, the Belgian super-soldier enhanced with animal DNA. It was in fact rabbit DNA, making him amazingly nimble, fast, and hyper-sensitive to his surroundings, along with a great kick. Unfortunately he gets no respect, so he compensates by an exaggerated code of honor and cultivates a reputation as a mercenary. Inspired by Batroc the Leaper.

The tortured spirit sent to Hell and offered power in exchange for service on Earth. The catch? She's a sacred soul, sent to Hell to offer redemption to the very damned. She can wield infernal power without corrupting herself, as long as she stays pure in her intentions.

The mystic ninja? Nobody else on the team knows there is one. They don't wear black wraps or highly visible Japanese costumes. It's the team butler, or the valet for the super-vehicles. It's the strangely knowledgeable or lucky civilian the team rescues on the scene, who happens to have the clue they need, or have picked up the vital dingus from the ground, or surreptitiously gets them out of the way of an energy blast just in time, whatever. There was that time, just once, when Noonsister opened a door and thought she saw somebody changing clothes, but there was a cloud of smoke and a log there instead. She shrugged. Weirder things had happened.

Senior citizens bravely volunteer to work in a radiation-thick area (c.f. pensioners around Fukushima in the real world). During cleanup and restoration efforts, one of them is bitten by a feral animal. The animal gains the proportional endurance, intelligence, and heroism of a radioactive human being, and decides to become an adventurer and hero. The result can be anything from Lassie to Rocket Raccoon - a team mascot, or even the animal equivalent of a "badass normal" vigilante. Honey Badger don't care, he just kicks criminal ass.

### The Magic Hammer, variety 1.

The characters inscribed on the gada - a type of South Asian mace - spell out the promise of power. A hero lifts it, and finds themselves transformed into a seeming replica of the monkey god, Hanuman! But like the mythology of Hanuman, they have no idea what their real powers actually are, and can only use them when reminded by somebody else. Unfortunately, not all the stories are true or complete...

A scientist-astronaut is struck by a gamma ray burst while in space. The burst comes from a distant galaxy, billions of years in the past. The catch? An alien civilization, knowing it was going to die in the hypernova that produced the burst, modulated the explosion in such a way as to encode the best of their stored knowledge and experiences.

If the scientist ever becomes too calm, alien emotions and knowledge will flood their mind and overwhelm them. If the scientist stays emotionally active, they can tap into advanced sci-tech knowledge  without being taken over by it. So now they're a costumed adventurer and hero, using impossibly advanced gadgets they barely understand themselves, riding the pulse of adrenaline and feeling to keep themselves human.

### Magic Hammer part 2, the Pen of the Bard.

A struggling writer receives a magic quill pen, reputed to be used by Shakespeare and/or other famous authors. Now they can use it to create profoundly persuasive and beautifully scribed works. They develop - or are taught - a system of mystic calligraphy. Using written spells on specially prepared paper, they wield a variety of powers related to paper, ink, letters, and writing in general. If they lose the quill pen, they lose much of their power - which can also happen if they ever cease to pursue the beauty of writing!

### Combining "alien comes to earth" and "kid swears vengeance":

Some time ago, a band of cosmic heroes defeated a Space Empire and its Emperor. While the Emperor was an expansionist ruler, he was also a loving family man, and all that his 8-year-old child knows is that one day aliens from this "Earth" came and shattered their family. Now one child has sworn vengeance: travel to this planet, blend in with the natives, track down the people responsible, and make them pay. How to get close without arousing suspicion? It seems there are these beings called "superheroes", and the angry young heir's quarry is among them...

As an added bonus, for political, religious, or super-physics reasons, whoever defeats the Emperor inherits the throne, but the heroes returned to their home planet and broke the line of succession. The heir must save their Empire from the scheming plans of other heirs or aristocrats by defeating the original cosmic supers and thus claiming the right of inheritance.

### It's not the vow of vengeance, but a kid's life changed at a young age:

Your parents walked home with you that night in the alleyway. When the gang appeared, you knew they weren't just muggers, and an offered wallet wasn't enough to deter them. That's when the vigilante appeared.

Someone died that night: the masked hero who'd appeared before you, and fought valiantly while you ran. They didn't have any powers, just bravery and a willingness to intervene. Your parents kept saying, over and over, "I don't understand what that person was thinking". You understood perfectly, saw it in their eyes when they shouted at you to run. You felt exactly the same thing. I don't want my parents to die.

That's when you first recognized mortality. And that's when you dedicated your life to doing something better. You learned martial arts, dedicated yourself to understanding criminal psychology, studied materials science and body armor. Some called you crazy, obsessed, desperate. You knew better. Your life had a direction, a clear and unquestionable path: honor your fallen protector. Save lives. Everywhere. No questions asked.

### Mutated by Ooze version 1:

A team of environmentalist scientists and adventurers disrupt an ecoterrorism attack on a major source of water: a dam, reservoir, or something similar. The team are all immersed in some sort of mutagenic ooze that the terrorists wanted to put into the water. It transforms them into human-animal hybrids. They discover that's the purpose of the stuff: to remove humans as polluters of Earth by turning them completely into animals. Now they fight back as post-humans - against polluters, hard green extremists, or anyone or anything else that threatens humanity.

### Assorted alien visitor subversions.

The aliens are masters of the mystic arts, not psionics or high tech.

The alien is an android or long lived herald for a slower than light invasion force due here in 20,000 years, but is happy to keep the planet running smoothly until then.

The alien is tracking a signal that emanated from Earth, or the solar system, millions of years ago. This may be another alien race, or a prehistoric Earth species or civilization.
# Discoveries
## The Magician's Tower

The tower stands solitary on a grassy plain. It has the shape of a forearm, capped with a defiantly closed fist. The stonework is rough and functional. There are enough outcroppings and imperfections that a dedicated climber could scale it. Its brown granite contrasts with the verdant green of the fields around it. In the distance, misty mountains and their snow-capped peaks are visible.

The tower should evoke **surprise**. It is the site of many strange magical experiments. The local animals will be smarter and stranger than their mundane cousins elsewhere, whether due to magical modification or simply exposure to bizarre energies. Blue lights play around the top of the tower at night. Strange flasks of stranger liquids are everywhere inside, glowing with every color of the rainbow. Shelves are wooden, asymmetric, and oddly angled, the product of inexpert and impatient carpentry. Stacks of arcane tomes lean haphazardly against the walls. Water from the nearby well glows a faint violet.

The PCs may be interested in the magician of the tower. Or the magician may be absent, and the PCs want to acquire something: a rare relic, an important book, or something similar.
# Mechanics
When you roll, you can get one of three outcomes: Success, Surprise, or Salvage. This gives you the ability to pick something you want from the scene, something that's true to your character, and something that's true to your goals.

* **Success** is straight-up. The thing you did works out the way you expected. Your goal is achieved in a manner consistent with who you are.
* **Surprise** means sacrificing something you wanted, or a way to get what you wanted. The door opens, but not because you did it - maybe you pass to someone else.
* **Salvage** lets you extract one thing of value from the roll, but the rest is in the GM's hands. Maybe you get a final shot at the boss before collapsing in the burning temple. Maybe you eject, but your plane blows up. The game will acknowledge your attempt and let you be true to who you are.

## Universal Exports
A small team of monsters (vampire, werewolf, etc.) get together to hunt down and stop human criminals that are untouchable by conventional law - rich industrialists polluting the earth, well-placed senators who got away with murder or abuse, genius serial killers who can outwit the police, that sort of thing.

The game explores different definitions of "monster", and illustrate how power and instinct can work for both good or bad purposes. You could do this easily enough by dusting off your White Wolf books and running a cross-splat campaign, of course. But I imagine it might benefit from more recent innovations in game design (like how to make planning a caper fun for players).
# Incomplete Story Ideas

## Disney animated variants

* **Beauty and the Beast**: Belle is secretly a werewolf.
* **Cinderella**: The fairy godmother is a good witch from Oz, and gives Cinderella the Ruby Slippers so she can leave Kansas and dance with a fantasy prince.
* **Sleeping Beauty**: I'd suggest something here, but honestly "Maleficent" already gave us the best twist possible.
* **Snow White**: The wicked queen's apple turns Snow White ugly rather than putting her into a deathly sleep.
