# Balancing Creative Debt
Stepping back from specifics on cards (or other games), I want to talk about a general problem I want to solve: how to distribute creative debt, and how to make it relevant.

Definition: when I say "creative debt" here, I mean "work that must be done to make the game interesting to play". It includes world-building, fantasy or scifi species creation, map-making, PC backstories, skill lists, and anything else on which the fiction hangs.

Creative debt, simply put, must be paid. If nobody knows what you're playing, there's no game.

Who can pay down this creative debt? There's only a few real choices:

- The author(s) of the game
- Optionally, the author(s) of any third-party modules, media franchises, or anything else that inspires the game
- The game master or facilitator
- The players

One question I want to tackle is: what is the best proportion between these people for paying that debt? Is it better if most of the work is done by the game creator (the apparent PBTA playbooks-and-menus answer)? Is it better done by the GM and players (the apparent Fate answer)? Is there a different proportion that yields more fun results, overall?

There's two further reasons to pay creative debt: because you have to, and because you want to. Any game more sophisticated than The Orc and The Pie (https://gist.github.com/kerrizor/4165372) has to have some work done to make it fun. But sometimes, somebody will want to add a new element because they want to. "I have this great idea for a Bard," says the GM. "I want a human Familiar," says the player of the tiny Void Mage. Either way, if fun demands it, the resulting creative debt has to be paid by somebody.

Some game design makes it easy for players to do it. Some don't. In Fate, I can just come up with an appropriate new Aspect or Stunt, and plug it in at the next opportunity. Dungeons & Dragons can range from writing a new skill (a single sentence will do, in 5th Edition) to a new spell or feat (moderately involved, with some balance questions), to an entire new character class.

At the same time, many people just like picking a playbook or class and getting to the game. I'm often one of these people. If people tell me "I want to run a new game for you", I don't want to invest a lot of early energy until I know the game will be fun. Give me a pregen, or a playbook, and let's see how it works out. But very soon, I'll reach a point where I get it, I'm on board, I understand what the system or setting wants to do, and I want to play with it.

So this is the other question I want to tackle: how do I make a game that doesn't require system knowledge at the start, but rewards you for gaining it later? I can create a new Masks playbook, but I have zero guidelines on how to do it from the text itself, other than the existing playbooks as a model. Is there a secret rubric for moves? Maybe I can discern one - or the game creators could just publish one. GURPS (for all the parts of it that people don't like) solves this with character templates, lenses, and other pre-packaged character builds, but then gives you very fine-grained control over your PC down the road.

The game that ideally answers these two questions will distribute the load of creative debt between creator, GM, and players; and will make it easy for GMs and players to expand on a solidly written foundation of archetypes.

Sure, start with the small questions!

But seriously, I’m tagging this to come back later with actual ideas and feedback. 

Short version: Microscope is a very different creative load, and a very different game, from most RPGs. 

----

I love every bit of this, but just wanted to tag two vectors to make sure you're incorporating them, because i think you're siting sources that already do...

1 - Time
Time spent on the game, and time spent ramping up to it.

"I don't want to invest a lot of early energy until I know the game will be fun. Give me a pregen, or a playbook, and let's see how it works out. But very soon, I'll reach a point where I get it, I'm on board, I understand what the system or setting wants to do, and I want to play with it.
So this is the other question I want to tackle: how do I make a game that doesn't require system knowledge at the start, but rewards you for gaining it later?"

This assumes 2 things:  1, your game is played in a series of sessions, not just a one-shot, and 2, that they are sequential and influence each other.  The Creative Debt for playing multiple sessions of Fiasco or In A Wicked Age are different from 5e or FATE.

2 - i forgot the other thing
But i know it was there.  But it's close to lunch.  And i started thinking about lunch.  So i'm going to go get lunch and then come back, hopefully after recalling the Other Thing...

I've thought about time, and I think the time element ties into what rewards you as a game creator. So here's some time-related assumptions I personally make about game creation and game play, and you folks can tell me I'm wrong based on your experience. Also if this is not what you meant by "time", please let me know.

TL;DR I don't have a lot of focus on con-friendly games because I typically don't go to gaming cons. This is for a variety of reasons that reduce to "busy schedule", "social awkwardness" and "lack of confidence in showing an untested game to strangers".

- You'll spend more time making one game than one group will spend playing it once. The decision of whether or not you should spend that time depends on what reward it'll bring you.

- What's the reward you get for making games? If it's "total time anyone played it", you need a ton of people doing one-shots and con games, a few groups playing long games, or something between those two. The reward I personally get is "people I know and respect, whose opinions I value, played the game and liked it".

- A game designed for short play probably won't be as easily extensible as games designed for long play, because that venue encourages smaller and self-enclosing mechanics. If the game has a brilliant system for resolving actions taken by space janitors on a mothballed USS Enterprise, but nothing else, I'm probably not easily hacking that.

- A game designed for long play probably won't be as easy to jump into as one made for short play. If I can make absolutely any Champs character I like but it takes an hour, I'm gonna walk away if it's a con or one-shot.

- As a player, I can't "get good" at only one-shot games. I can get familiar, but that's not the same thing. If there's no value to knowing the material long-term, give me less material I have to learn before I can start playing. This is aside from external reasons to learn it, e.g. "this game sucks but I want to understand the dice system" or "this is my friend's game so I'm here in solidarity or to provide playtest feedback".

I LOVE ALL OF THIS.  now tell me more about getting good.  unpack that.  Does it have to do more with 'winning' or with 'doing what's in keeping with the game' or 'being easily creative?'  what does Getting Good look like?

----

Basically #2 (doing what the game asks) and #3 (being easily creative).

Within a game (rules + setting/conceit) there's a band of allowed fiction. Within what's allowed, I can bring something that's new, provocative, iconic, etc. - basically anything that sustains the interest & fun for myself and the group. Getting good is (a) understanding that range of fictional possibilities that the game is promoting and (b) achieving enough system mastery to see such actions play out in ways that feel authentic.

Example: in a Vampire game, I'm setting up an embarrassing social situation for the favored consort to the city's Prince, so I can swoop in to save them and make myself look good. Understanding that this sort of situation is possible and desirable in this game, and knowing the dots, Disciplines, etc. that would get me there, is "getting good". The process of getting good would involve reading the Abilities rules, any rules on social situations, the lore on how the local Kindred run the city, etc.

That's pretty hard to do in a one-shot, unless I'm handed a character sheet and ruleset that makes it pretty clear what I can do and whether I'll probably pull it off. Like if you just hand me Snargle's sheet from Lady Blackbird and open with "hey you are piloting this flying ship, the Owl, and there's ships shooting at you, what do you do", I'm gonna be like "I uh, I pull off some kinda fancy maneuvers to avoid it..?" and that should be a right answer.

If I play Lady Blackbird enough times, I'll be like "yeah, the Owl has this gizmo that I can..." and spin out some LB-appropriate fiction. But it's all gonna be variations on this theme of "wise-cracking goblin pilot". That's familiarity, but not something I'd define as an actual skill.

----

So,  given these parameters, what's better:  a game with limited but focused play (you say funny one liners as the character we assign you) or broad and lose (make a character that makes this story unique, but doesn't clash with the tone), or in between? And why?

----

Hmm. 

I think of game mechanics as being a language. With greater skill, you can express more interesting and novel concepts, and more eloquently convey arguments. You can even remember/reconstruct interesting quips more easily. 

Some games also come with a lot of game lore, which is like a literary cannon. With greater mastery you can make references (jokes, allusions, quote authority) and better recognize where people are going (oh, this is another manifestation of that classic plotline) and the game of lobbing references at each other to communicate obliquely that is actually so vital to collaborative storytelling. 


So in terms of creativity, it’s not just making things, or even making things and not forgetting and remaking them, but also making things that fit with how this world works while doing implicit negotiation about what that means.

----

Focused vs. Loose: I've enjoyed both and I don't want to have to pick between the two. My goal is to discover a game design that easily supports both.

I have a personal preference for longer, more sophisticated stories, and long games are how you tell those.

Aside from preference, in software, sometimes running a system in production for a long time is the only way you can see all the ways elements come together and interact. I've found the same is true of RPG systems, and so letting it run for awhile is often the only way to learn (or learn from) a system. Since game design includes incorporating successful elements from elsewhere, I want a deeper understanding of those elements, and hence need to play those games for awhile to get it.

----

Games as Language: I'm totally on board with this. Grand Adventure V2 even says this:

The conversation happens when players discuss how the fiction should play out. It includes making suggestions or asking questions. When a player says, “I think the Ogre should have a spear instead of a club”, that’s the conversation. So is the MC asking the player, “what is Tana doing about the Ogre?”

The rules give you a vocabulary for having that conversation.

The rules I'm writing these days tend toward loose coupling: fiction pushes you into a specific rule, you resolve things with that rule, and the resolution pushes you into more fiction. The rules can then sit in relative isolation. I'm thinking of them, basically, like parts of speech, with which you construct a "sentence" that means something in the game.
