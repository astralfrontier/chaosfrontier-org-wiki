<!-- TITLE: Blood And Thunder -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A Conan-esque pulp fantasy for Genesys -->

# About
Touchstones: Conan and Kull the Conqueror stories by REH; games like Barbarians of Lemuria.
# Archetypes
* The archetypes from the core book are all okay
* "Cimmerian"/"Aquilonian" brute/noble types?
# Careers
* All the Fantasy-applicable careers from the core book ought to be viable, with some possible tweaks
* Consider others: Barbarian? Zealot?
# Skills
## Combat Skills
Melee and Ranged are not divided into separate skills; fighters tend to pick weapons based on situation, rather than proficiency.
## Knowledge Skills
* **Knowledge (Forbidden)** is the knowledge of dark rites, buried mysteries, the names of forgotten gods or demons, and other scraps of the world of beyond and before.
## Magical Skills
There are four Magical skills, replacing the skill list from Genesys:

* **Abyssal** (WIL) is the summoning and binding of dark forces from beyond the world's borders. The creatures thus conjured, sometimes called "demons", are eternal and alien, but may be dealt with by the fearless.
* **Atlantean** (INT) is the practice of ancient Atlantean rituals and traditions. Much of this knowledge is lost, but even the remaining scraps have power. Atlantean magic is intellectual, demanding long hours of study and concentration.
* **Mithraic** (PR) is power drawn from Mithras, the sun god, whose priests and cults dot the land. One's strength of will is key; it is not known whether Mithras would (or can) withdraw power from a heretic priest, leaving the cult's own enforcers to do the deed.
* **Necromantic** (CUN) draws on the power of blood and life, exchanging vitality from source to source. Necromancy can strengthen the living or animate the dead, but there is always a price.

TODO: a tribal shamanism, similar to the existing Primal skill?
# New Talents
**Taint of the Grave**: Tier ??. Add a bonus die to Necromantic actions. Add a setback die to social interactions, except those involving other necromancers or the creatures they conjure.
# Magic
TODO - decide which magical actions (Genesys p. 212) each discipline should be capable of.

Attack ought to be specialized or flavored. This is not a genre where Fireball is usually a thing. Offensive casters should look at Curse instead - if you want to do damage at range, be an archer or conjurer.

Augment should be more of the "drink this" variety of magic, less cleric-y buff spells.

Conjure should be Abyssal and Necromantic. Accessory items, permanent sacrifices, talents, etc. might make it easier to summon up specific things. Look into how to do a "dark pact" that doesn't also destroy the PC's moral compass.

Healing should be the province of Mithraic and potentially Necromantic magic, and _always_ come at a price.

Suggested modifiers for Necromantic magic: assess some kind of price, in vitality (blood loss, a sacrifice, etc.) and add setback dice if the price is not paid
