# New Skills
## Magical Skills
There are four Magical skills, replacing the skill list from Genesys:

* **Abyssal** (WIL) is the summoning and binding of dark forces from beyond the world's borders. The creatures thus conjured, sometimes called "demons", are eternal and alien, but may be dealt with by the fearless.
* **Atlantean** (INT) is the practice of ancient Atlantean rituals and traditions. Much of this knowledge is lost, but even the remaining scraps have power. Atlantean magic is intellectual, demanding long hours of study and concentration.
* **Mithraic** (PR) is power drawn from Mithras, the sun god, whose priests and cults dot the land. One's strength of will is key; it is not known whether Mithras would (or can) withdraw power from a heretic priest, leaving the cult's own enforcers to do the deed.
* **Necromantic** (CUN) draws on the power of blood and life, exchanging vitality from source to source. Necromancy can strengthen the living or animate the dead, but there is always a price.

TODO: a tribal shamanism, similar to the existing Primal skill?
# New Talents
**Taint of the Grave**: Tier ??. Add a bonus die to Necromantic actions. Add a setback die to social interactions, except those involving other necromancers or the creatures they conjure.
# Magic
TODO - decide which magical actions (Genesys p. 212) each discipline should be capable of.

Conjure should be Abyssal and Necromantic.

Healing should be the province of Mithraic and Necromantic magic, and _always_ come at a price.

Suggested modifiers for Necromantic magic:

* Assess some kind of price, in vitality (blood loss, a sacrifice, etc.) and add setback dice if the price is not paid
