# Header
After watching/listening to some stuff, a plot for a two-character comedy came to me. I'm sure this general premise has been done before, but this is my version.

There's a girl (G) who has mind-controlling pheromones. If she's in the area with you, she can make you want to do what she says. When the story starts, she's using it to live in expensive hotels for free, eat free food, etc.

There's a boy (B) who's a technical genius. He lives alone, not even going to school, in a smelly, messy apartment. He has no hygiene. A government team wearing hazmat suits forcibly deposits G in B's apartment. She, used to having nice things and presenting herself well, is appalled and tries to order him to clean up. We learn one reason she's been put here: B has no sense of smell at all. He's thus unaffected by her pheromones, but that means he's also the first person in her life who can treat her like a normal person.

G has to clean this kid up for her own sanity, because she's got an electronic ankle bracelet that the government uses to ensure she doesn't escape and cause more trouble. B just wants to be left alone, but the government is willing to fund his tech toys if he takes care of G. We follow their shenanigans as they learn to work together, even cooperate. Both characters are far more lonely than they'd like to admit, because most people they interact with are only interested in their powers or skills, not them as people.

### Comments

* Good so far. Needs a bit more of a major threat or obstacle to add tension, imho. 
  * There's a larger threat or problem implicit in the setup, but it needs time to materialize. The main characters need to earn our sympathy first.
* Perhaps this is just me, but I’d definitely gender swap it.  Although in that case, making the male pheromone source explicitly asexual/chaste is probably important.
  * Mostly because “woman is super socially manipulative” and “man is tech savvy but socially disgusting” and “woman trapped with man who is immune to her charms” are all old tropes, to the point of being stereotypes and cliches. And, in the post-GG world, their one’s I’ve seen weaponized enough that I, personally, find them offputting. 
  * That's fair. For me, "man has power to tell other people what to do" has a longer and more personally annoying pedigree in human history, with "man of class and taste redeems wretched woman" somewhere in my top 20. "Woman with power to casually deal with people accosting her" has positive appeal to me, and these two will not be staying isolated for long.
