<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of It Was There Honest -->

# It Was There, Honest!
**Pitch**: several kids try to convince an adult their fantastic story of underground cities, UFO abduction, ancient magic, etc. really happened. The catch: it did.
**Profile**: a one-shot story game with two roles (one Adult, two or more Kids)
**Actions**:
* Adult: poke holes in a story; ask for more detail; teach a life lesson
* Kids: try to earn respect; impress the other kids; protect another kid from adult scrutiny

**Scenarios**:
* "Katie didn't touch the dangerous glowing rock, I did" (keep the heat off another kid, or direct it to another kid)
* "Of course I didn't let Timmy out of sight the whole time!" (earn respect from the Adult)
* "That's right, he did!" (support another kid)
