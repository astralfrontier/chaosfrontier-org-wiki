# Kaiju Pirates
## Background
**Kaiju Pirates** is a steampunk world, somewhere between Earth's 1890 and 1915. The continents are slowly sinking into the sea - or is the sea level rising? The world powers ensure their survival by harnessing the power of *kaiju*: giant monsters, leviathans, behemoths, call them what you will.

Pirates sail submerged in the bellies of enormous sea creatures converted into steampunk cyborgs, or controlled via chemical or occult means. Entire trading downs ride atop the shells of gargantuan sea turtles, their course dictated by the ocean currents. Overhead, the rare roc or pteranodon cruises the skies, and its mysterious riders watch, observe, and calculate.

Kaiju on land are kept at bay via complex wards and barriers, or enslaved as weapons or tools, or even killed and harvested for their exotic biology. Many roam free, endangering both people and the old world order.
