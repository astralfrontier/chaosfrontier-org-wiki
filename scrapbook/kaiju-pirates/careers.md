## Galvanist
**Summary**: the Engineer or Mechanic for Kaiju vessels

A specialist in electricity and other forces, which are used both in modern industry (for lighting, machinery, heating and cooling, and so on) and in Kaiju management (for interfacing with the creatures' nervous systems). Galvanists combine a working knowledge of physics, chemistry, biochemistry and Kaiju biology, and a practical talent for getting into the (sometimes literal) guts of what they're working on.
