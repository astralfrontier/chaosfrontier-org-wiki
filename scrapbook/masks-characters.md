# Other or Undecided
* a thrill-seeker who manifests powers with enough adrenaline
* a beastmaster/animal-controller
* a Russian DIY cyborg.
* A Legacy mixing the Divine & Speedster powers - And it makes me think of a character concept where the speed-reading was the important power, not the super-running. Like some ancient god of wisdom sponsors a line of librarians who memorize the whole library. Library of Alexandria burns? No problem, Hypatia got it all in her head first.
  * It sort of puts me in the line of thinking with Hermes, though.  Learning all the knowledge and then disseminating it all, too.
  * That would be Athena
  * but this one is neat for the versatility. Are they a mage today because they ingested a million grimoires over the years? Is their patron god really fucking annoyed because there's nothing but Internet shitposting now? etc.
  * Athena goes to war against internet shitposting
