<!-- TITLE: Durandal -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Durandal -->
# The Premise
* Found a cursed artifact sword at age 13-14
* Was possessed by it and fought as a villain for 2-3 years
* The curse was broken thanks to the actions of someone significant (a Sorcerer Supreme, helpful priest, etc.)
* The character possesses muscle memory for swordsmanship, athletics, etc. and can use these skills when not thinking about it
* The character wants to use their skills to do right, and/or atone for their time as a villain
* Many adult heroes and some Modern Generation may not realize the curse has been lifted, or might mistrust the character for other reasons (e.g. due to past encounters)
* The sword itself may still have a presence in the game, and the character may interact with it
* Other contacts may exist due to the sword itself - "who does an evil magical sword know?"
