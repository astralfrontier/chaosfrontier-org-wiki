<!-- TITLE: Ghost -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A happy phantom -->

# The Premise
* A character who escaped domestic abuse by turning invisible and intangible
* During this time he thought he had actually died and become a ghost, and his family was unable to find him
* He found the whole experience liberating and now joyfully does his own thing out in the world
* He's lonely and directionless, with some notion of "doing good" but no clear direction and no friends to anchor him
* He lacks financial support and must rely on theft or donations to get by
* He can consciously use his powers, but they activate on their own during moments of great stress or fear
# The Beacon
**Hero Name**: Ghost
**Real Name**: TBD

**Look**: man, white, smiling face, casual clothing, iconic costume

**Abilities**: camouflage and stealth (invisibility), phasing

**Labels**: Danger -1, Freak -1, Savior +2, Superior +0, Mundane +2

**Backstory**:

* *How did you gain your skills?* At home, I got hit and passed out. That wasn't the first time. But this time, I just - disappeared. I thought I was dead. My folks looked for me and couldn't find me. I thought they'd killed me, though, so I ran away. But I don't know _how_ it happened.
* *When did you first put on your costume?* When I got hungry, and stopped being afraid, and came back outta ghost form. I realized I was still mortal, but I had a power now, and I could _pretend_ to be a ghost. And I didn't want my folks finding me again.
* *Who, outside of the team, thinks you shouldn’t be a superhero?* TBD
* *Why do you try to be a hero?* What happened to me shouldn't happen to anyone. Being away from that situation, though, it was so liberating. I never felt so free before! And I want to share that too.
* *Why do you care about the team?* TBD

**When our team first came together**, we found signs that this incident was just the start of something bigger. What were the signs?

* TBD is awesome, and you take every chance you get to hang out with them.
* You’ve got to prove yourself to TBD before you feel like a real hero.

**Drives**:

* Pull off a ridiculous stunt
* Get a new costume

* Tell someone your true feelings for them

> And if I die today I'll be the happy phantom
> And I'll go chasing the nuns out in the yard
> And I'll run naked through the streets without my mask on
> And I will never need umbrellas in the rain
> I'll wake up in strawberry fields every day
> And the atrocities of school I can forgive
> The happy phantom has no right to bitch
