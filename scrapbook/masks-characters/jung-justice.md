**Backstory**:
* *When did you first use your powers?* we were on a field trip to a temple in Greece, and I transformed unexpectedly.
* *Who was the first person you accidentally hurt with your powers?* the teacher on the trip got scared and tried to mess with me. He's okay now, but it put the fear of god - at least a couple gods - into him.
* *Who, outside the team, helps you control your powers?* My best friend Tracy, who does library research on old myths and legends.
* *Why do you continue to use your powers?* Parable of the talents, man. That's Biblical.
* *Why do you care about the team?* Heroes are the new legends. Greeks had their boys Hercules and stuff, now we got the same. Being a legend is one thing, but hanging with them is something else.

**When our team first came together**, we destroyed our surroundings in the fight. Where was it? What did we destroy?

Jung Justice has the following powers:

* Myth-masking: J.T. can tap into the world's collective psychic gestalt and extract shared archetypical figures from that. The way some superheroes can shift into any animal on Earth, J.T. can become any god or legend known to the people of Earth.
* While in mythic form, J.T. gains the reputed strengths and weaknesses of that form. The mindset of the form also partially imposes itself on him - if he becomes a wise god, he gains wisdom, but he can also gain negative traits such as jealousy or rage.
* When not in mythic form, J.T. is shrouded by an aura of protection that will snap him into an appropriate mythic form if his life is at risk, or if other conditions are met. For example, if he is attacked by magic, he might automatically become a figure of legend who was known for resisting enchantments.
* J.T. can sense the presence of mythically or legendarily significant powers at work - magic spells, enchantments, the presence of a god's temple or holy symbol, and so on.
