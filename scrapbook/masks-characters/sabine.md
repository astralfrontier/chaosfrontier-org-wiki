# The Delinquent
**Hero Name**: Sabine (named after [Wallace Clement Sabine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Clement_Sabine))
**Real Name**: TBD

**Look**: white; laughing eyes (concealed under black goggles); casual clothing; showy costume

**Abilities**: can detect and manipulate sonic energy, allowing flight, super-speed, attack deflection, and an ESP-like "vibration sense". Other powers are also possible, e.g. sound simulation or audio illusions. ("teleportation" but as "super-speed", with secondary powers)

**Labels**: Danger +0, Freak +1, Savior -1, Superior +2, Mundane +1

**Backstory**:
* *How did you get your powers?* Affected by some kind of mutagen or transformative event - rendered blind, but given powers
* *What do you do for fun?* I mess with my friends' lives, try to set up cute couples, and just generally make things better for people when they refuse to do it themselves
* *Who, outside the team, thinks better of you than you do?* Dr. Cross, the medical expert who monitors cases like me. He's ridiculously kind, even I'm put off by it.
* *Why do you try to be a hero?* You know, everyone's so afraid of everything all the time, they need to wake up and realize that life's better than they think. It's okay to explore, even if sometimes you get hurt. Break outta your shells, people!
* *Why do you care about the team?* The truth I'll never tell is that I want an audience for how cool I am, and these losers are pretty cool too - they just need to stop being so dour and serious.

**When our team first came together**, we totally broke some major rules to win the fight. What rules did we break? Whose rules were they?

TBD

**Relationships**:
* I keep trying to impress TBD with my antics
* I and TBD pulled an awesome (if illegal) stunt together.

**Influence**: TBD 3 people have influence.

**Delinquent Moves**:
* Mary Contrary (I'm the one playing Cupid and Auntie Mame here, don't try to psychoanalyze _me_)
* Troublemaker (I love helping, but I'll help people my way)
* Are you watching closely? (I love pranks)
