# The Outsider
**Hero Name**: Sprout
**Real Name**: Midge Leafstone

**Look**: (scrawny) human body; bizarre eyes; average clothing; no costume

**Abilities**: Size-changing (radical shapeshifting), impossible mobility (replaces flight), pretty tough

**Labels**: Danger -1, Freak +1, Savior +0, Superior +2, Mundane +1

**Backstory**:
* *Where did you come from?* I'm a [Borrower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Borrowers) - a tiny humanoid who lives in the nooks and crannies of the human world. I have size-shifting powers, though, so I can grow to giant size! Look, I'm almost 5 feet 2!
* *Why did you come to Earth?* I want to make friends with the giants. My people are hidden away and scarce, and we need to be friends with you.
* *Why do you want to stay here (for now at least)?* There's so many amazing things when you're a giant. All this stuff I saw from a distance, I can get up close and really interact with it!
* *Why do your people want you to come home?* They're afraid I'll get hurt, that you people will hurt us, like you always do.
* *Why do you care about the team?* These are kids, like me, maybe they're different like me, maybe we can understand each other.

**When our team first came together...** TBD

**Relationships**:
* You've been learning about Earth by spending time with TBD.
* You have a crush on TBD but you keep it under wraps.

**Influence**: Locked down - give influence to one person

Outsider Moves:

* Alien Ways: Whenever you openly disregard or undermine an important Earth custom in favor of one of your own people’s customs, shift Superior up and any other Label down.
* The best of them: When you comfort or support someone by telling them how they exemplify the best parts of Earth, roll + Freak instead of + Mundane.
* Not so different after all: When you talk about your home, roll + Freak. On a 10+, choose two. On a 7-9, choose one. During the conversation, you: confess a flaw of your home; add 1 Team to the pool; mislead them about your home; take Influence over them; describe the glories of your home; clear a condition. On a miss, you inadvertently reveal more about yourself than you planned; tell them a secret or vulnerability you haven’t shared with Earthlings before now.

Sprout has the following powers:

* Supreme physical fitness, agility, and speed. Borrowers have evolved over generations to be fast, nimble, and cunning, staying one step ahead of animals, nature, and (worst of all) human beings. They can endure physical stress that would exhaust or hurt a human.
* Size-changing. Sprout can scale from four inches to about 5' 2", a small human. It might be possible to shrink smaller or grow bigger - Sprout hasn't tried. Sprout can also use size-changing tactically, to duck out of the way of attacks or leap through gaps. This is a mutant power, unique to Sprout.
* Animal friendship. Like many Borrowers, Sprout has an empathic or telepathic connection to some animal life, that allows communication or exchange of impressions. Sprout can use this to befriend certain animals or work with others as allies, mounts, and more.
