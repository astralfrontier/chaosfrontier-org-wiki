<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Peacock Throne -->

# The Pitch
In this fantasy world, wizardry and magic aren't a function of pure scholarship, nor of some inborn talent or mystic inheritance. Your ability to wield magic flows through your body and mind coming into alignment. Personal excellence - the mastery of one's self and the world around it - is what matters. Thus, wizards are much more like martial artists.

# The World
There are four great realms, where once were five. The Nightingale of the West is a regal jewel of the desert, with dark-skinned warriors and haughty princes. The Crane of the East is a contemplative and sophisticated civilization of scholars and travelers. The Falcon of the North is an unforgiving range of wintry mountains, whose people are generous to friends and lethal to enemies. And the Swan of the South is a fertile land of artists, dancers, and merchants.

The fifth realm, the Peacock, sat at the center. In it mingled the best qualities of its neighbors. It was a city-state surrounded by farmlands and forests, where representatives of the other realms met and discussed great matters.

A generation ago, the city played host to one such gathering of the brightest minds and boldest artists. During the event, the Peacock was sacked by a mysterious invading army. By the time reinforcements arrived from the four realms, the matter was long over with.

It was unthinkable that any army outside the borders of the realms could penetrate so far. Suspicions festered and became accusations. The peace broke.

## Wizards

Wizardry cannot be hammered out on an anvil. It cannot be drilled into pliable young men by an angry sergeant. It cannot be poured into a bottle for later use. The greatest powers of the age are available only to those who work to attain them.

As a result, armies, soldiers, mercenaries, city guards, and other sorts of conventional fighters exist, but the true power of the realms rests with wizards. These people choose their allegiances and methods as they wish - to act as sheriffs and enforce the peace, to sell their services as security experts, to rule over a city fairly or tyrannize a countryside, to fight injustice where they find it, to avenge wrongs done to those they hold dear.

A wizard has mastery over the elements of nature, over subtle vibration, over the terrestrial and the celestial energies. A novice wizard can strengthen their blows as they fight, while experts can summon elemental manifestations, uproot trees, survivel lethal injury, and many other feats. Many wizards have some unique or signature move. A wizard's fighting style(s) relate closely to the sort of magic(s) they wield - one can learn about a wizard's powers by watching them fight.

# Characters
1. Your wizard concept will have one or more fighting styles that correspond to a type of magic they wield (e.g. elemental magic, weather control, animal shapeshifting, whatever).
2. Your wizard ought to have some appropriate motivation, a drive to go do something. It should be compatible with the drives of other PCs in the long run, although short-term conflicts are possible.
3. Your wizard ought to have one or two NPCs important to them - family, lovers, allies, old friends. Some of these NPCs might have different relationships to multiple PCs (e.g. the sister of Alice is also Bob's fiancee).
