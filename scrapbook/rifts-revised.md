# Rifts Revised
Playing Rifts again got me thinking about how to fix it. I think that must be everyone's eventual reaction to Rifts.

As usual, I'd get all high-brow and thoughtful if I did something Rifts-like. I've actually done something like it before (the "chaos frontier" games online), but if I wanted a post-civilization fantasy/scifi/horror kitchen sink, here's some key elements I'd use:

1. The use of 3D printers as a basis for technology. Civilization is gone, but you can build high-tech stuff using advanced "makers" if you have the plans. Once you get the plans for something, you can make more. Scarcity comes from the necessary raw materials, but I'm not going to tell anyone their unique power armor is lost forever.
2. The concept of emergent vs. transcendent properties as a dichotomy of magic and science. "Transcendent properties" would be something like "Beauty" or "Cutting". A magic sword with the Cutting property could sever anything it was swung at, and if a scientist analyzed the blade, he'd discover that its material properties were indeed capable of cutting through anything. Those properties emerged from its Cutting property, rather than a sword being sharp by virtue of its molecular arrangement or whatever.
3. Multiple realms: our physical world (dominated by science), a dream-based world overlaid on ours (dominated by magic), and an electronic cyberspace (dominated by information). Each realm connects to the others in some ways. The dream-world being overlaid over reality explains why things of myth or familiar legends are what we actually see.
4. Other worlds reachable via some magic shortcut - unusual dimensions, other planets, alien civilizations, whatever.

What's at stake? Civilization, survival, the usual things. I don't have a unique spin for this, but I'm still thinking about it.

I had an explanation for why Earth was significant for a Lovecraftian game, and I could do something similar here. Aside from that, the active influences here are "The Gone-Away World" by Nick Harkaway, the "Heresy" CCG from the 90s, and "The Strange" (if recursions overlapped onto Earth rather than being their own bubbles of reality).
