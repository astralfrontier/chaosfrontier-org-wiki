# Premise
I want to write about a plucky young software engineer and amateur mechanic, her canny survivalist conservative father, and how they cruise around a post-apocalyptic America in their solar Google self driving car.

* Neo-feudalist Silicon Valley bros ruling their empires
* CRISPR/CAS-9 gene editing led to the apocalypse
