# Weird character ideas
* Ninja Culinarian - slice and dice monsters, cook delicious food, wield incredibly sharp kitchen knives, and disappear without a trace.

# Strange fanfics

* I know there is Nightmare Before Christmas fanfic where Jack takes over another holiday. [My favorite](https://twitter.com/opensorcerer/status/865181951266660352) would be Valentine's day. [Related](https://twitter.com/astralfrontier/status/1095353528325947392): With Valentine's Day around the corner, consider that "The Grinch Who Stole Christmas" as a title can lead to other Grinches and other holidays.
* A Final Destination type series of horror films, but instead of Death, [a surly 20-something must avoid Love](https://twitter.com/astralfrontier/status/1099917295290335233), and a series of increasingly improbable Meet Cutes with strangers and romantic moments with friends or co-workers.
* The premise of one show + the characters from another. For example, [what if](https://twitter.com/astralfrontier/status/1095657602711580673) the sex/species-bending curses of Ranma 1/2 made their way to Archie Comics?

## Quantum Leap

* [Quantum Leap/Evangelion](https://trello.com/c/cYliBBFE): Sam and Al must fix Shinji Ikari's family and relationship problems and pilot a giant robot.
* **Quantum Leap/Doctor Who**: Sam leaps into Classic Doctor while he's on Earth & must now fight aliens w/ 7 PhDs and roundhouse kicks while the real Doctor is in waiting room rebuilding Ziggy, and Al is getting drunk at all this nonsense - or trying to flirt with Sarah Jane Smith.

# Left field game ideas
* A [syntactic magic system](https://twitter.com/astralfrontier/status/1078971105866444800) where the vocabulary is drawn from modern internet culture and memes, e.g. the Yeet Rune
* You're a group of Three Laws compliant robots [dropped into](https://twitter.com/astralfrontier/status/1098384216549658626) a zombie apocalypse. Or Game of Thrones.
* You know how the MIBs or Men in Black keep the world safe from aliens, or shut down UFO investigations, or keep gov't secrets, or whatever, for the good of society? [Why not](https://twitter.com/astralfrontier/status/1089969237714587648) an MIB that preserves social order in small ways?
  * Didn't take your pills today? MIB sniper on a rooftop shoots a tiny tranq dart into your neck at work, you're good. Too much anxiety due to weird guy in your face telling you about how he loves beer? Couple folks in black suits hustle him away.
  * Every time you post art and make a comment about how you're not sure you're any good, there's some sort of reassuring anonymous comment.

## Assorted White Wolf
* Mage: the Ascension's cosmology [speaks to me](https://twitter.com/astralfrontier/status/1089620469223895040) much better if you replace "belief/disbelief" with "caring/apathy". Magic stopped working because people lost their sense of wonder in it.
* **Maid: the Ascension** - a mashup of [Mage](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Mage:_The_Ascension) and [Maid](http://www.maidrpg.com/)
