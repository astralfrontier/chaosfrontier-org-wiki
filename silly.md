### Waifu: the Shipping
A game set in the World of Darkness where you play anime waifus. It'll be based on the NWOD five-and-five approach.

Waifus organize into groups called *Harems*, representing everyone romantically targeting a single person or a small group (singularly or collectively referred to as "sempai" here). Waifus have a trait called *Ship*, measuring how relationship-prone they are. Your ship goes up when you have *Tease* with another character.

Your *appeal* is one of five qualities, representing what makes you a desirable waifu:

* *Moe*: you're cute and adorable, and people want to protect you. You engage in slice-of-life antics.
* *Tsundere*: you're usually short-tempered and shouty, but you have a soft and loving side that people want to see. You badger the people around you.
* *Imouto*: you're the little-sister type, caring and devoted. You perform domestic activities and get jealous.
* *Cosplayer*: you disguise yourself somehow, either to dress up for fun or to hide your identity. You do things in keeping with your disguise.
* *Kemonomimi*: you are partially or wholly non-human, like a catgirl. You engage in behaviors typical of the non-human part of your heritage.

Your *goal* is one of five positions, representing what you want to be as a waifu.

* *Polycule*: sempai can marry all of you, and you'd prefer it that way. You have abilities built around coordination and cooperation.
* *Rivalry*: you're not so much after sempai as you'd like to beat other members of your own Harem.
* *Victory*: you're here to win, though you won't stoop to actually sabotaging the other Haremettes.
* I need two more

Waifus have a *Cuteness* meter, replacing Humanity. Doing uncute things lowers your Cuteness. To get it back, engage in your appeal's recommended activities.
