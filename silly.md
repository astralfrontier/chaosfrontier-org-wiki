# Weird character ideas
* Ninja Culinarian

# Strange fanfics
* Quantum Leap/Evangelion. Sam and Al must fix Shinji Ikari's family and relationship problems and pilot a giant robot.
* Sam quantum-leaps into Classic Doctor & must now fight aliens w/ 7 PhDs and roundhouse kicks while real Doctor is in waiting room rebuilding Ziggy & Al is drinking.
* I know there is Nightmare Before Christmas fanfic where Jack takes over another holiday. [My favorite](https://twitter.com/opensorcerer/status/865181951266660352) would be Valentine's day. [Related](https://twitter.com/astralfrontier/status/1095353528325947392): With Valentine's Day around the corner, consider that "The Grinch Who Stole Christmas" as a title can lead to other Grinches and other holidays.
* A Final Destination type series of horror films, but instead of Death, [a surly 20-something must avoid Love](https://twitter.com/astralfrontier/status/1099917295290335233), and a series of increasingly improbable Meet Cutes with strangers and romantic moments with friends or co-workers.
* The premise of one show + the characters from another. For example, [what if](https://twitter.com/astralfrontier/status/1095657602711580673) the sex/species-bending curses of Ranma 1/2 made their way to Archie Comics?
# Left field game ideas
* A [syntactic magic system](https://twitter.com/astralfrontier/status/1078971105866444800) where the vocabulary is drawn from modern internet culture and memes, e.g. the Yeet Rune
* You're a group of Three Laws compliant robots [dropped into](https://twitter.com/astralfrontier/status/1098384216549658626) a zombie apocalypse. Or Game of Thrones.
* You know how the MIBs or Men in Black keep the world safe from aliens, or shut down UFO investigations, or keep gov't secrets, or whatever, for the good of society? [Why not](https://twitter.com/astralfrontier/status/1089969237714587648) an MIB that preserves social order in small ways?
  * Didn't take your pills today? MIB sniper on a rooftop shoots a tiny tranq dart into your neck at work, you're good. Too much anxiety due to weird guy in your face telling you about how he loves beer? Couple folks in black suits hustle him away.
  * Every time you post art and make a comment about how you're not sure you're any good, there's some sort of reassuring anonymous comment.

## Assorted White Wolf
* Mage: the Ascension's cosmology [speaks to me](https://twitter.com/astralfrontier/status/1089620469223895040) much better if you replace "belief/disbelief" with "caring/apathy". Magic stopped working because people lost their sense of wonder in it.
* **Maid: the Ascension** - a mashup of [Mage](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Mage:_The_Ascension) and [Maid](http://www.maidrpg.com/)

## Waifu: the Shipping
A game set in the World of Darkness where you play anime waifus. It'll be based on the NWOD five-and-five approach.

Waifus organize into groups called *Harems*, representing everyone romantically targeting a single person or a small group (singularly or collectively referred to as "sempai" here). Waifus have a trait called *Ship*, measuring how relationship-prone they are. Your ship goes up when you have *Tease* with another character.

Your *appeal* is one of five qualities, representing what makes you a desirable waifu:

* *Moe*: you're cute and adorable, and people want to protect you. You engage in slice-of-life antics.
* *Tsundere*: you're usually short-tempered and shouty, but you have a soft and loving side that people want to see. You badger the people around you.
* *Imouto*: you're the little-sister type, caring and devoted. You perform domestic activities and get jealous.
* *Cosplayer*: you disguise yourself somehow, either to dress up for fun or to hide your identity. You do things in keeping with your disguise.
* *Kemonomimi*: you are partially or wholly non-human, like a catgirl. You engage in behaviors typical of the non-human part of your heritage.

Your *goal* is one of five positions, representing what you want to be as a waifu.

* *Polycule*: sempai can marry all of you, and you'd prefer it that way. You have abilities built around coordination and cooperation.
* *Rivalry*: you're not so much after sempai as you'd like to beat other members of your own Harem.
* *Victory*: you're here to win, though you won't stoop to actually sabotaging the other Haremettes.
* I need two more

Waifus have a *Cuteness* meter, replacing Humanity. Doing uncute things lowers your Cuteness. To get it back, engage in your appeal's recommended activities.
