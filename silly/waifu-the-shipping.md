# Waifu: the Shipping

A game set in the World of Darkness where you play anime waifus. It'll be based on the NWOD five-and-five approach.

NOTE: all Waifus are age 18 or older.

A **Waifu** is a cute girl whose goal is to engage in romantic-comedy shenanigans and attract someone's affections. Waifus go to school, live at home, go on vacations, or otherwise engage in typical mundane activities. In the World of Darkness, a Waifu is a shining beacon of happiness and joy, but not always a source of comfort to those who know the truth. The force that empowers a Waifu does not always have her best interests in mind. It exists to be amused, and the successful Waifu is skilled at delivering.

All Waifus fear an event called **Graduation**, which can happen any time between ages 18 and 25 - whenever they reach both physical and mental maturity, and find it impossible to engage in moe antics any longer. At this point, their mysterious patron may remove their powers - or transform them into something else entirely. No Waifu knows just how Graduation will go. They only know one thing. The only Waifus who've returned to report a happy ending were the ones with whom someone fell in love.

## Character creation

Waifus organize into groups called *Harems*, representing everyone romantically targeting a single person or a small group (singularly or collectively referred to as a *Sempai* here). Waifus have a trait called *Ship*, measuring how relationship-prone they are. Your ship goes up when you have *Tease* with another character.

Your *appeal* is one of five qualities, representing what makes you a desirable waifu:

* *Moe*: you're cute and adorable, and people want to protect you. You engage in slice-of-life antics.
* *Tsundere*: you're usually short-tempered and shouty, but you have a soft and loving side that people want to see. You badger the people around you.
* *Imouto*: you're the little-sister type, caring and devoted. You perform domestic activities and get jealous.
* *Cosplayer*: you disguise yourself somehow, either to dress up for fun or to hide your identity. You do things in keeping with your disguise.
* *Kemonomimi*: you are partially or wholly non-human, like a catgirl. You engage in behaviors typical of the non-human part of your heritage.

You belong to one of five possible *clubs*, often actual school clubs or other meeting grounds for Waifus. Each club takes a different approach to how to win Sempai's heart.

* *The Five Rings*: an organization that believes every member of the harem should marry their Sempai. They emphasize cooperation and coordination between members of a Harem.
* *The Service*: a club whose members take up positions such as maid or cook, hoping to win a Sempai's heart through devotion and hard work. They emphasize loyalty and work as the support in a Harem. Their signature Beat is Katei-jutsu.
* *The Knife*: a club that focuses on blocking other Harem members from influencing a Sempai. Though they sabotage the Harem's ultimate goal of winning Sempai's heart, there's no one who'll fight harder to protect the Harem itself.
* *First Girls*: a club that emphasizes the steady building of a relationship with a Sempai. While they may be friends with others in the Harem, there's an understanding that the First Girl will always push forward in the race for Sempai's heart. Their signature Beat is Flashback-jutsu.
* *The Careless*: a club that draws Sempai's attention through dependence and need. Rather than charming or serving Sempai themselves, the Careless want Sempai devoted to them. Members often refer to Sempai as "Onii-chan".

### Cuteness

Waifus have a *Cuteness* meter, replacing Morality. Doing uncute things lowers your Cuteness. To get it back, engage in your appeal's recommended activities.

1. **Shrew**. Persist in boring or selfish actions.
2. TODO
3. TODO
4. TODO
5. TODO
6. TODO
7. **Plucky Girl**. Sin: display selfish or negative emotions openly.
8. **Genki Girl**. Sin: don't use your verbal tic or cute gesture.
9. **Comic Relief**. Sin: be useful or contribute to a plot.
10. **Moeblob**. Sin: showing distinct personality traits or meaningful goals of some kind.

## Beats

A Waifu's supernatural power comes from her connection to an ineffable cosmic energy. Just as Prometheans are endowed with the Divine Fire of inspiration, Waifus are bestowed a light-hearted ability to bend reality in favor of whimsy, comedy, and romance. Whether this force is benevolent, or merely some eldritch entity amusing itself through human theater, is something most Waifus don't care to think about.

Waifus manifest their power through Beats, or "plot beats", a collection of abilities that sustain a lightly comedic story regardless of their surroundings. A Waifu in a combat situation might be a capable fighter, depending on her background, or simply clumsily prat-fall her way through the scene and come out without a scratch.

All Waifus have access to a few key powers:

* **Scene Change**: you can "hard cut" yourself, and the people around you, into a new context. This is a combination of teleportation, memory alteration, and glamour. Supernatural individuals who are Scene Changed with you will recognize that something unusual has happened to them. Once you Scene Change, you (and those with you) cannot do so again until something interesting or funny happens where you end up.

A Waifu has a rating in one or more of the following Beats:

* **Doji-jutsu**: skill at being clumsy and ill-coordinated. A skilled Dojiko can avoid attacks by tripping, accidentally fall into something or someone to damage it, or (at high levels) cause a chain reaction of clumsiness.
* **Flashback-jutsu**: skill at spinning memories, or perhaps actually modifying the past. A skilled Flashback user can introduce new truths to their story, gain knowledge by looking backward in time, or (at high levels) adjust continuity retroactively to change established reality.
* **Katei-jutsu**: skill at cooking, cleaning, and domestics. A Katei user can wield household instruments as weapons, create healing (or harmful) food or drink, or effortlessly conceal objects in unlikely places around a house. High-level users can arrange any surroundings so they function as a comfortable living space.

## Charm Points

Waifus sometimes equip accessories or maintain personal fashion styles that amplify their Ship, maintain their Cuteness, or empower their Beats. These are collectively called "charm points". Examples:

* Thigh-high socks
* A twin-tail or other unique hairstyle
* Bells, ribbons, or frills
* Unusually colored hair

## Enemies

Life isn't cherry blossoms and love letters for a Waifu. They face opposition from several sources:

### The Broken-Hearted

A Waifu can grow up alone, or enter into a loveless relationship. When this happens, their hopes and dreams for a romantic future transform into bitterness and resentment. They become the Broken-Hearted, and wield powers of seduction, authority, and control over the free-spirited Waifus.

### The Fandom

Spiritual beings seek to use or pervert Waifus and their powers for their own ends. Dirty online pictures, fanfiction, and similar tokens of their twisted appreciation can hurt a Waifu's power. Waifus fear the more powerful manifestations of Fandom's strength, such as body pillows or online shrines. Waifus who fall victim to being lewded by the Fandom can be transformed into wretched two-dimensional beings, called Thots.

### Other supernatural beings

Vampires, Werewolves, Mages, and other supernatural entities can interact with Waifus. Vampires typically regard them with distrust or confusion, Werewolves with disgust, and Mages with fascination.
