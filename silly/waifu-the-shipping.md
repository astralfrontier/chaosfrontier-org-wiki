# Waifu: the Shipping

A game set in the World of Darkness where you play anime waifus. It'll be based on the NWOD five-and-five approach.

## Character creation

Waifus organize into groups called *Harems*, representing everyone romantically targeting a single person or a small group (singularly or collectively referred to as "sempai" here). Waifus have a trait called *Ship*, measuring how relationship-prone they are. Your ship goes up when you have *Tease* with another character.

Your *appeal* is one of five qualities, representing what makes you a desirable waifu:

* *Moe*: you're cute and adorable, and people want to protect you. You engage in slice-of-life antics.
* *Tsundere*: you're usually short-tempered and shouty, but you have a soft and loving side that people want to see. You badger the people around you.
* *Imouto*: you're the little-sister type, caring and devoted. You perform domestic activities and get jealous.
* *Cosplayer*: you disguise yourself somehow, either to dress up for fun or to hide your identity. You do things in keeping with your disguise.
* *Kemonomimi*: you are partially or wholly non-human, like a catgirl. You engage in behaviors typical of the non-human part of your heritage.

Your *goal* is one of five positions, representing what you want to be as a waifu.

* *Polycule*: sempai can marry all of you, and you'd prefer it that way. You have abilities built around coordination and cooperation.
* *Rivalry*: you're not so much after sempai as you'd like to beat other members of your own Harem.
* *Victory*: you're here to win, though you won't stoop to actually sabotaging the other Haremettes.
* I need two more

Waifus have a *Cuteness* meter, replacing Humanity. Doing uncute things lowers your Cuteness. To get it back, engage in your appeal's recommended activities.

## Beats

A Waifu's supernatural power comes from her connection to an ineffable cosmic energy. Just as Prometheans are endowed with the Divine Fire of inspiration, Waifus are bestowed a light-hearted ability to bend reality in favor of whimsy, comedy, and romance. Whether this force is benevolent, or merely some eldritch entity amusing itself through human theater, is something most Waifus don't care to think about.

Waifus manifest their power through Beats, or "plot beats", a collection of abilities that sustain a lightly comedic story regardless of their surroundings. A Waifu in a combat situation might be a capable fighter, depending on her background, or simply clumsily prat-fall her way through the scene and come out without a scratch.

Typical beats:

* **Scene Change**: you can "hard cut" yourself, and the people around you, into a new context. This is a combination of teleportation, memory alteration, and glamour. Supernatural individuals who are Scene Changed with you will recognize that something unusual has happened to them.
* **Moeblob**: you can avert damage to yourself through cutesy behavior, innocence, and naivete. If you seem like you can do no harm, no harm will come to you.

## Enemies

Life isn't cherry blossoms and love letters for a Waifu. They face opposition from several sources:

### The Broken-Hearted

A Waifu can grow up alone, or enter into a loveless relationship. When this happens, their hopes and dreams for a romantic future transform into bitterness and resentment. They become the Broken-Hearted, and wield powers of seduction, authority, and control over the free-spirited Waifus.

### The Fandom

Spiritual beings seek to use or pervert Waifus and their powers for their own ends. Dirty online pictures, fanfiction, and similar tokens of their twisted appreciation can hurt a Waifu's power. Waifus fear the more powerful manifestations of Fandom's strength, such as body pillows or online shrines. Waifus who fall victim to being lewded by the Fandom can be transformed into wretched two-dimensional beings, called Thots.

### Other supernatural beings

Vampires, Werewolves, Mages, and other supernatural entities can interact with Waifus. Vampires typically regard them with distrust or confusion, Werewolves with disgust, and Mages with fascination.
