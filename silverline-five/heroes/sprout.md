# Background
Ant-Man as a Borrower.
## Where do you come from?
I'm a Borrower - an inches-high humanoid who lives in the nooks and crannies of the human world. I have size-shifting powers, though, so I can grow to giant size! Look, I'm almost 5 feet 2!
## Why did you come to Earth?
I want to make friends with the giants. My people are hidden away and scarce, and we need to be friends with you.
## Why do you want to stay here (for now at least)?
There's so many amazing things when you're a giant. All this stuff I saw from a distance, I can get up close and really interact with it!
## Why do your people want you to come home?
They're afraid I'll get hurt, that you people will hurt us, like you always do.
## Why do you care about the team?
These are kids, like me, maybe they're different like me, maybe we can understand each other.
