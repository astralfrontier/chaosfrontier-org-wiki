Named for a [famous astronomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Tarter) known for her work on intelligent life in the universe, this high school is more like a private academy.

# Students and Faculty
The school serves Silverline City's population, and admits students whether or not they have super-powers. Power use is regulated and monitored, but not forbidden outright. Although the school is privately funded, the city has set aside enough money that any middle-school student with good grades and an endorsement from _someone_ can get sponsored.

Students and teachers use the city's extensive mass-transit system to get to and from school. The buses, funiculars, slidewalks, and other options are free to cheap, safe to use, and carefully monitored.

The teachers are a mix of professional educators, hand-picked experts, specialists, and oddities. The teachers are well-compensated and treated with more respect than many American educators expect. Any of the students in their classes could literally save the world one day.

# Facilities
The school cafeteria provides hot lunches and snacks to the students at no charge. Students can bring their own food, of course.

Like most modern buildings in Silverline, the campus is equipped with multiple emergency shelters in case of disaster, supervillain attack, and the like. The school performs mandatory safety drills on a regular basis.

School security is provided by a combination of remote monitoring (via security camera, etc.), human security officers, and support robots. Non-lethal weapons are sometimes permitted in the hallway, if no other option to restrain a super-powered brawl between kids is possible.

The school has a library, including both physical and electronic works. A large holographic work area has been set up on one side of the library, permitting group study or presentations.

# Academics
The school has an ultra-efficient curriculum, designed by a team of super-intelligent geniuses in the city. The curriculum is designed for easy absorbtion of complex subjects, with an emphasis on technology, social topics, and economics. Tarter High students are going to be the next generation of leaders and knowledge workers, and the affluent of Silverline know it.

Students are equipped with "slates", a portable computer in a tablet form factor. Slates have a primitive AI - not sentient by any means, but capable of having a basic conversation and teaching interactively. A slate also functions as a student's identity card, and allows them access to restricted areas of the school on an as-needed basis. Within the school, a student's slate relays their position to the school security apparatus.

# Electives and Extracurriculars
Most of the school's budget funnels students into science, technology, and business. STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields all have well-funded clubs and regularly visit interesting areas in Silverline. However, the school mirrors the city's international nature, and clubs of all descriptions and purposes can ask for school support. Food, art, sports, theater, religion, and every other aspect of human culture has someone interested in sharing it with their fellow students.

The clubs double as after-school care for many students, whose parents often work late. The cafeteria runs at a reduced staff for dinner hours as well.
