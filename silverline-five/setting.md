# History

Almost sixty years ago, the world met its first public superhuman: a test pilot code-named Apollo. Almost fifty years ago, America put him on the Moon, and ushered in the Space Race.

Twenty years ago, Earth beat back an invasion from the stars. The aliens, who we dubbed the "Zeta", were nigh unstoppable. Our best and brightest gave much. Our most courageous gave everything. Our heroes, and even some of our villains, fought together to save their planet.

> The Zeta are not intended to be a continuing campaign element, though players or the GM can have them make some kind of repeat appearance if desired. In that case, decide on the nature of the Zeta race, their goals, capabilities, and so on.

During the war, a massive Zeta mothership crash-landed on Earth. The military took charge of the site. Scientists arrived to analyze the wreck. Technicians came to assist the scientists. Engineers provided tools and infrastructure. Hot dog vendors kept the engineers fed. Barbers gave haircuts to the hot dog vendors. Supervillains snuck into the site to plunder the cache of Zeta wonders. Superheroes flew in to protect the civilian population from the villains. Before long, the fallen mothership had turned into a city of its own.

Time passed. People fell in love. Families formed, or immigrated. A new generation of super emerged: children for whom the city was not opportunity, but home.

Today, heroes and villains soar the skies, doing battle with each other. Marvels of engineering emerge from advanced laboratories. And science pirates descend into the depths of Sector Zero in search of alien ultra-tech. The city was born under a cloud of tragedy, but every cloud has a silver lining.

> *   It's from the future. What caused it to come here, and why? From how far ahead did it come? Was it accidental, or intentional? And who might have a connection to its eventual builders?
> 
> *   The ship is magical or mystical. It's a remnant of Atlantis. It's from another plane, a dimension of magic, or even Earth's own mystic past. The city might even be the hatched egg of a cosmic being, with residual magic taking the place of ultra-tech. What kind of supernatural creatures, like elves, dragons or demigods, might live in the city?

# The City today

Silverline City's population is international and exceptional. Many people around the world live with the risk of bombs or land mines. It takes something extra to live inside a giant sleeping weapon. As a result, only the best of the best live and work here. The ramen chef by the train station knows he could die, or worse, if some Zeta weapon goes off. Then again, he gets to greet world-renowned physicists by first name in the morning. The city's populace is a close-knit family, thanks to shared danger and common purpose.

The city is the source of amazing technology. This makes it a prime target for supervillains, alien bad guys, and tech thieves. In response, many superheroes have emerged to fight them. Home-grown gadgeteers, mutants created by Zeta tech, or extraterrestrial champions all live here. Because of this, Silverline City has the highest super population in the world.

The city leadership includes both civilian and military elements. The city's mayor is an elected official. "Chief of security" is the title held by the highest-ranking military officer. Civilians manage most of the infrastructure, such as lights and water. The military may override them in emergencies. By mutual agreement, each side respects the boundaries of the other. A civilian police force handles most peacekeeping duties. They can call in the military if a criminal has serious hardware, such as Zeta tech or energy weapons.

The ship's hull forms a solid wall around the perimeter. A dozen gates provide ground traffic with access to the outside. The top is open to the sky, letting in both sun and rain. The ship came down at a slight angle. The city thus has a noticeable slope, like San Francisco or Seattle. Funiculars, or cable railroads, carry cargo and passengers up or down the hills.

The city's architecture reflects its international character. North American, Asian, and European influences blend together in an attractive whole. Buildings have organic lines. They are often made from concrete, faux wood, and high-tech glass. The glass acts as solar panels as well as transparent computer displays. Cupolas rise above tiled or thatched roofs. Sliding doors and interior partitions allow occupants to redesign the interior to taste. People use modular shelving, cushions, and mats in place of chairs or wooden furniture. Colorful mosaics line the interior walls. White concrete is often painted by residents to give a building local character. Gardens follow in the Persian style, divided into quadrants by water and pathways.

> Where did Silverline City crash-land?
> 
> **On unoccupied terrain**. A few rural settlements were been wiped out, but the occupants were evacuated.
> *   What is the local terrain - is the area forested, mountainous, desert, or even a lake or sea?
> *   How do people get there - new freeways, water traffic, or even by airship?
> 
> **On top of an existing city**. The old city was destroyed, and the what survived is in bad shape. Most people were evacuated in time, but many couldn't be. Survivors now live in Silverline. Some try to repair their old homes and workplaces. Monuments to the fallen will be common. The newly built city's architecture will be reminiscent of the old. Major place and street names will be reused.
> 
> *   What existing city was displaced?
> *   How bad was the devastation?
> *   How do the old residents feel about the new ones?
> 
> **In international waters**. No single nation can lay claim to the land where it lies, so the city is truly international. The city's defenses are strong enough, to repel a sea-going invasion from any country.
> 
> *   Is the city neutral, or does it ally with some nation or group such as the U.N.?
> *   Has anyone attacked it, and how did it work out if so?
> *   Is the city floating, anchored in place (or resting on a continental shelf), or entirely underwater?

# Daily Life

When the children of Silverline aren't off playing (or being) heroes, they go to school. Marie Curie Academy is a private school for the gifted, super or not. A mysterious benefactor sometimes sponsors those whose families can't afford tuition. College-age students attend Heywood Floyd University (or "Hey U").

Outside of school, there are malls, movie theaters, arcades, parks, and more. Silverline has high-tech attractions the rest of the world dreams of. If you're bored, you're doing it wrong.

Aside from the usual holidays, Silverline citizens celebrate Gray Day. Part memorial, part fierce affirmation of life and hope, Gray Day is the anniversary of the day on which the alien ship crashed. The dead are eulogized, while the living are celebrated.

Most residential areas are "up top", or the more elevated parts of the crash. This provides a panoramic and spectacular view of the major sectors. Many adults ride on "slidewalks" to the funiculars in the morning, then ride down the hill and take buses or walk the rest of the way to work. Their children take buses to school up top. Major-league games, concerts, and so on happen "downtown" as well.

> Answer the following questions for your character(s):
> 
> *   Do you live in a classy mansion, a squalid apartment, one of many identical adjacent brownstones, or something similar?
> *   Do you live alone, with family, other?
> *   If someone visited your room, what would you be most proud to show off?
> *   If someone visited, what would you be most worried that they'd find?

> Answers to setting questions:
> 
> *   When and where did the city crash? Cape Cod, north side of the hook, in 1999
> *   What existing city was displaced? Barnstable, Dennis, Brewster, Orleans, and Eastham - the city is almost 15 miles in diameter
> *   How bad was the devastation? Lots of flooding, but the area was evacuated in time
> *   How do the old residents feel about the new one? Everyone’s property investment was ruined so they’re upset about that, but a lot of the Old Money invested in the new city’s industry, so opinions are mixed

> Does anyone have a personal involvement with the science pirates? Sabine knows a couple guys who were members
> 
> Have you fought a gang before? How did it go? Guardian Ghost and Sabine have both tackled the gangs before. They weren’t able to do much on their own.
> 
> What kind of music do people like?
> 
> *   Small independent artists and experimental musicians are here
> *   Well-known acts didn’t show up to perform in a death trap of a city at first
> *   Karaoke as bonding ritual between people working dangerous jobs
> *   Artists giving live performances connect better with an audience
> 
> What performing arts can be found?
> 
> *   Craft shows, leather, painting, ceramics - people interpreting the city’s mythology in tangible art
> *   Holdovers from the quaint artistic culture of the Cape
> *   The appeal of local artists, people who hang out at a certain place or can be regularly found somewhere
> 
> I think because people who move there have to be open minded and a bit free spirited to live there. Things might happen at any time so it’s not exactly stable. I think people who are “independent artists” are more likely to take risks and roll with the punches, and would enjoy the freedom offered by an unconventional environment.
