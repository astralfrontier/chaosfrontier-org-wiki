The universe seems to pinwheel a moment, as the ship travels through the glittering tunnel of the wormhole which seems lit from within. After a minute of travelling through this back-door through the Universe, the ship emerges from the Jump-Gate on the other side, entering the Eisen system. A few more jumps through gates will carry them out of formal Gaian space, and into the terrirtories along the stretch of Jump Gates that link Gaian and Earther space. The steady beeping of a Space Station's identification broadcast is the most prominent thing on the sensors, it's dock looming ahead. The communication system beeps with an incoming message: "Attention Unidentified Ship, please identify yourself, and state your business."

Jack presses a button on the console. His automated recording goes out: "Captain Jack Southport, master of the free trader _Fast Buck_, conducting cargo and/or passengers to their appropriate destination."

Jack's finger wavers over the glowing button next to it, the one that'll transmit a subtly-worded sales pitch for his services, but some people dislike that sort of thing on the public bandwidth.

Emily hums to herself, occasionally slipping in a word or two in the song. She's just piloting, never mind her. She watches Jack curiously, "Everything automated, huh?"

"As much as possible," the trader replies. "They do voice-stress analysis on broadcasts sometimes, so I record stuff when I'm in a neutral mood."

A few silent moments pass, before the return response: "Alright _Fast Buck_, you are cleared for dock at docking bay 4. Welcome to Tzar Station."

"I suppose, but it's fun to mess with 'em a bit," says Emily. She asks Jack, "So, any chance we'll hit a casino soon?" She rubs her hands together and grins, "I just need a few hours.."

Jack frowns. "Hey hey, not so fast," he replies. "Just how much of your cut are you intending to take with you?"

Emily laughs softly, "Oh, not too much! Just whatever little bits can be spared, you know?" She grins widely and hmms, "Jack, you really gotta trust me, okay?"

"Sure sure," mumbles the merchant. "HAINZEL! Get up here, we need to talk," he announces over the ship's intercom.

"Hainzel," murmurs Emily, giggling to herself. "I can't wait to meet Gretel."

Hainzel comes out of hiding. "Ya, ya, I'm here," he says, that nervous jittery tone never leaving his voice. "What is it? We're where we need to be, yes? Tzar Station?"

"Not just yet," says Jack smoothly. "There's the matter of a replacement set of space-armor. There's the matter of parts and fuel and reaction-mass storage, and the cost you'll doubtlessly incur to get new containers, since I doubt you want to sell like a junk-sale out of my back cargo hatch. The armor will come to 4500, and I appreciate that the er, strategy at the gate was not strictly your idea. Nevertheless, we did get you out without losing anything truly vital, yes?"

"Oh yes, well then. A replacement set of space-armor? I believe I can handle that. The storage you say? Very well, I uhm, hmmmm. I shall handle those things then, or cover them for you, as you like. And thank you for getting me here safely." Hainzel is quite appreciative and in no mood to argue over little things like that, it would seem.

Jack smiles and bobs his head. "Well, you understand that a flat fee won't do. However, you are negotiating the sale of your goods, yes? You have no fixed price arranged with your buyer?"

Hainzel nods, "Yes. I am negotiating the price of my goods. So a simple flat fee won't do? What is it that you would propose then..."

Emily nods to Jack, just hoping the money is good. She'll let Jack do the talking for now. This is his gig, anyway. At least as long as he keeps up the good work. "I'm sure we can come up with something very fair, right Jack?" she suggests, grinning widely.

Jack extends his hand. "I offer my services as a Mindsmen trade expediter for 20% of the proceeds. Since I suspect that this is ah, merchandise you didn't pay anything for to begin with, you've lost very little. The transit fees were a pittance, after all."

"Well I can understand where you are coming from, and I should point out that I have indeed paid for this merchandise. It is my starting stake, as it were, in my climb to power. Transit fees aside, I believe, that twenty percent is a little expensive. Would you be willing to settle on ten percent? Before expenses and all, which I am covering." Hainzel's voice loses that nervousness as he slips into negotiator mode.

"A man who's climbing to power should remember to reward his friends along the way," says Jack, reproachfully enough. "He never knows when he might need them again. Seventeen percent."

(( So you think this guy's stuff is really worth anything? )) asks Emily of Jack. She turns to Hainzel, "You know, you really are negotiating a bit firm with a rather weak hand. After all, we could just ditch this thing." She doesn't add the part about possibly ditching this passenger, but lets that subliminal suggestion hang in the air.

Jack shakes his head at Emily. "No, we have a contract with this man. We'll carry it out, not threaten him. We too are climbing the mountain of power and influence."

"Yes, and I have offered a reward, but you are right, your quick thinking kept my cargo intact." Hainzel pauses, "But, if I offered you fifteen percent of the profits instead, and left you with two contacts, perhaps that can be agreed upon?"

Jack extends his hand and shakes the other man's firmly. "We have a deal," he says with conviction. "I may seem like a grasping merchant to you, but I honor my bargains as they are made."

Emily hmmss to herself. (( I hope this turns out well for us, Jack. )) She studies Hainzel carefully, "Well, I suppose that should be good. Two contacts, huh? I hope they are rich."

"Yes, well if a merchant is not grasping, then that is when you have something to worry about." Hainzel chuckles a bit, before going on, "Now then, after we dock I shall meet with my buyer and negotiate the price, after acquiring my containers of course. I hope you don't mind staying on board for the next day or so?"

"You sure you won't need some muscle along for this negotiation?" asks Emily. "It'd be rather disappointing if we were stuck with this valuable.. whatever was it again?"

"That's just fine. Of course, you'll want me along for negotiations," replies Jack. "If you forget, and ignore my reminders, I'll just sit here and collect my 15% anyway, but you'll want to get your money's worth. The rest of the time, there's no problem in staying here." He concentrates a moment. (( It'll turn out just fine, Em. This isn't over yet, so keep your space-armor close. ))

"Ah yes, of course, of course. Well then, when you are ready Captain, I shall begin making the arrangements and the appropriate negotiations." Hainzel looks quite relieved...

Emily guides the ship into the dock with the ease of years of practice. "You know, I've been driving since I was just a little girl," she murmurs. "And I love docking just as much now as I did then.. hmm, now where's that button?" Emily will do anything to mess with people.

And so the ship docks, without any hassle. The gravity is turned on as the docking bay doors close, and the ship is able to land easily enough. A moment or two later, and they can safely exit the ship. Hainzel is quite eager to do so, and after he leaves the last half of the transit fees with Jack, he begins making calls from the docking bay's communication terminal. A few automated messages pop up in the communications queue, things like re-fueling requests, and offers to have repairs made, and the like.

Jack's software declines most of the offers and queues up the rest, though the free-trader himself is more interested in what Hainzel is up to. He stays quiet and unobtrusive, tapping out maintenance agreements a second or two here and there, ready to move out the instant his client does.

Emily sighs softly and slumps back against the chair. "Bored bored bored," she chants, turning to study Jack. "I realllly gotta find myself a good place to check out. I wonder what they have to do around here.."

Jack chuckles softly. "Alright. What do you like? Casinos, piloting, tying men to chairs and escaping ruffians is all I know about your interests, so please elaborate."

The station's communication system is a simple, efficient, inelegant one, as are many things out this way. Hainzel pulls up the name of his contact, records a few messages, stating his name, his purpose, and who he works with. There's a little elaboration, and a few things to indicate familiarity or at least to indicate a desire to have this business be settled in a friendly manner. As for Emily, well, there's an information terminal of the station conveniently located near the door leading out of the docking bay.

"Casinos are nice, but actually, I'm in the mood for making a little bit of money more honestly," says Emily. "They have a classy club here, by chance? Or failing that, the best bar in the place will do. I'll be back in a minute, Jack, okay?" And with that, she's heading to her quarters, leaving Jack some time do the work she should have done for herself.

Jack shrugs. "You'll get much better odds working the local market, though!" he calls loudly, and uselessly.

Hainzel regards Jack. "The local markets? Well..." And a few minutes pass as he shows the fellow how to check what commodities are for sale, and how to plot the quickest way to determine where they will be worth the most, given the travelling expenses.

After a 'short' while, Emily slips out of her quarters. Not dressed for space, that's for sure. That black gown of her's is now in use, the fabric sparkling from the diamond dust. She has herself completely done-up with a careful use of make-up. Her dark hair is allowed to flow free. With a wide grin she walks on up to Jack, spinning around. "So, any luck finding me a good club?" she asks, her voice somehow changing, turning into a soft purr.

Jack appreciates the distraction from the pedantic Hainzel, and smiles approvingly. "I'm sure you'll have no problem, looking like that. But make sure a good club doesn't find you instead. Like in the back of the head, hmm? Hainzel, are we ready?"

"Ready when you are," he says, as he finishes one last communication. This one text only.

"You should stop by, Jack. I'll be singing for our supper, and a lot more, if I'm lucky," says Emily. She will wink and get on her way as soon as possible.

The meeting conveniently enough takes place in the Starlight Lounge. Which serves as the best, and only, bar on the station. Several large viewers have been installed, providing an omindirectional view of space, giving the illusion that one is floating in the void, save for the doors leading out. Soft piano music is piped through a very elegant sound-system, and a myriad of characters populate the bar at this moment.

Emily will glide in, holding herself just right to emphasize what exactly the creator was generous enough to give her. As good as she is at the controls of a ship, one might wonder if this is really where she belongs. She'll stroll up to a bartender, "So, who can I talk to about adding a little soul to this place for a night?"

"You wish to add a little soul to this place?" The bartender here, is dressed smartly in an almost formal style. "You would talk to me, so what did you have in mind? And how little is this soul you are wanting to add?"

"You have a nice piano, but wouldn't you do better with a singer to go with it?" suggests Emily, sliding a hand through her hair and smiling. She leans a little onto the bar, flashing the bartender a rather generous view in the process. She's done this more than a few times, clearly. "I'm not too expensive. I figure a few drinks, maybe a little bit to eat, and whatever tips are offered me is fair, isn't it?" She maintains that smooth, gentle purr as she speaks.

"Yeah. That sounds fair. But the question is whether or not you are good. This remains to be seen, however... you are welcome to sing so long as there are no complaints. We do make an attempt to run a classy establishment here." The bartender gives a bit of a smile, and graciously accepts the offer. "So when things calm down a bit, come back, and we'll give a listen and see when we can get you singing. And for how long."

Meanwhile the meeting goes down as Emily flirts with the bartender. Hainzel's contact is a rather scruffy looking fellow with eyes that narrow frequently. He is Human though, which is good. The negotiations go smoothly, resulting in a nice tidy profit for both Hainzel and the free trader.

Emily winks at the bartender, "You are a wonder. I won't let you down." She offers the most polite of curtseys and then heads off to find herself a good place to sit down and relax. Probably just close enough to 'talk' to Jack as she casually flirts with men sitting at other tables. She always seems to have drinks, but she doesn't have a penny on her.

An hour passes, and the audition takes place. Emily nails it easily. And so she's given a mike, and a time to perform, later this time cycle. A few hours pass, and the sound system announces, "And here at the Starlight Lounge, we will be providing you with some live entertainment..." The pianist begins to play with a soft flourish, giving a rather sultry introduction for the singing starfarer.

Emily glides out, more than just happy to have so much attention. She basks in it. Her voice glides easily into the air, and a deep blues song sets the mood for the night. Even in dim lights Emily appears to glisten as if covered in dew, thanks to that diamond dust. She won't even introduce herself. The music will have to suffice.

The audience applauds, and there are several shouts of 'Encore, encore!' or it's equivalent to be heard. Several patrons swipe cards across a reader that displays the tips thus far, approaching a hundred... she must be singing nicely.

Fresh from bargaining, Jack mumbles introductions at his companions at the table, explaining whose voice they are now hearing. He turns again to watch the performance, raising his glass appreciatively and smiling, his attention focused on his shipmate.

There's hardly a need for a call. Emily's voice purrs out, "Don't worry boys, I won't be leaving you early." And she has no intention on departing right away. She wants to give the bartender his money's worth, after all. A song does not a set make. She'll try something different, departing from the deep blues and going into a joyous song to lighten the mood. All the while she moves, just casually meeting eyes, flirting as if it were no more difficult than breathing for her.

The audience eats it up. And the tips keep on coming until the end of the set. She's managed to snare a good 300 credits worth of tips, when all is said and done. Plus her meals for a while...

After she's entertained them for a good hour or so, Emily will step down, setting the mic down carefully and making her way over towards Jack. Depending on how crowded his table is, she'll set herself down with him. On her way she'll graciously accept a few kind words, shamelessly wink at a few proposals to make far more money in other ways, and generally enjoy the fruits of her labor.

Jack raises his glass in silent tribute and smiles. "Well done," he murmurs. "It sounds like you did quite well for yourself."

As Emily makes her way over, Hainzel excuses himself. He does bow to her though, "You sing beautifully. However I'm afraid I must see to room and board for myself... I believe my business here is done... thank you both, very much."

Emily actually blushes a bit, at the compliment. She's apparently a bit touchy about her singing. "Thank you, Hainzel. So this is where we part ways, I take it?" She looks over to Jack. (( Thanks. It's just something I picked up when I was younger, I guess. Good way to save money on expenses. ))

"So, we did pretty well," muses Jack, lugging aboard his shiny new set of space-armor. He stows it carefully, working some numbers on his portable. "So let's see... a 50/50 split nets you $5,000 of the original deal, and for my services to Bertram Hainzel, $80,000.. How much did you make on tips?"

"Around 300, plus food and drinks," says Emily. She knuckles at her back, "They had pretty good food. What is this place called again?" She never pays attention to the little things. "I rather liked that club. I may have to come back again. Classy place and plenty of people with a good taste for music."

Jack nods, smiling. "300's not bad. Think it'll be enough to gamble on? I assume you're keeping the 5000 around for something sane.."

Emily sighs. "You keeping the whole 80 for yourself, then, huh? Figures." She doesn't even sound surprised. "You going to unzip me, or is that too much to ask from a man who is a lot richer than he was before he met me?" She turns her back to Jack, waiting for him to help her out, or perhaps waiting for him not to.

"Well, it was my job, not yours," says Jack, sounding a little hurt as he moves forward to oblige. "Tell you what. Prove me to me you can win at the casinos, and I'll invest some money in you. I'll supply you with principal, and you keep 90% of your winnings, while I get my stake back, plus 10%. If you lose, you owe me the principal, no 10%. How's that sound?"

"Sounds fair enough," answers Emily. "So where do you plan on letting me play? I don't do dives anymore. Bad experience. I have enough trouble to deal with already thanks to gambling in the wrong spot." She scowls, and the expression makes her face ugly, "That bastard Jimmy Dalion caught me in one, and that's when I lost it all."

Jack opens his hands, gesturing broadly and smiling. "'Let' you play? Well, wherever you like, certainly. I just feel - and justly so, I might add - that there is bad business going on here, and I for one would like to be away from it for the present time."

"Sounds fair enough," says Emily. She slips a hand into the back of her dress, scratching her skin. "Let me get us out of here. Hainzel was polite enough, in a way, but I don't want to see him again."

Jack gestures toward the board. "Any time you're ready," he says. "I want to pull away, then sweep the ship before we get going."

Emily nods and muffles a yawn with a hand. She sings quietly to herself as she draws the ship away, "Sometimes I think, oh yes I'd move to where all the shooting stars are gone.." But she doesn't go on, simply letting the words hang in the air.

Whistling while he works, Jack waits until the _Fast Buck_ is well away from the station. He checks the radar and surface sensors, and finally the internal sensors. Content that there's no hidden stowaways, he ambles back toward the cargo bay, beginning a thorough internal sensor sweep of the vessel. Both the ship's own equipment and his personal multiscanner come into play

Emily leaves all the worry wart stuff to Jack. She's just going to kick up her feet and try to relax. She's rather disappointed that she doesn't get a share of Jack's good fortune, but she'll have her own fortune soon enough, she tells herself. Her luck just has to get better eventually.

Transit to another star system is the next item on the agenda for the _Fast Buck_, and during the wait and the trip, Jack works on composing as neutral a message as he can. He identifies himself, explains his business briefly, and gives the barest synopsis of events (including his take, which was no more than double the conventional fees for transiting the cargo Hainzel had). Upon arrival he dispatches this message to Eisen Mining Corporation's headquarters, and marked with all the proper keywords. It should find its way home. Satisfied, he turns to Emily. "Now. Before we get started on business, where would you like to go?"

"How about New Rome?" suggests Emily. "That's always good for a buck, and if nothing else, I can find another place to sing at for a while. It helps build my reputation in an area. I've done it a few times. Nobody treats a popular club singer too unfairly. Losing your songbird is bad luck, after all." She sighs softly, "And here I have a little over five thousand and I need to turn it back into sixty times that.."

Jack swallows. "What the hell do you need 300,000 for?" he asks incredulously.

"To break even, Jack," answers Emily. "Jimmy swindled me out of 300, so I need to make it back, you know? I would feel pretty sad not breaking even in any month of gambling."

Jack shrugs and wipes his brow a bit. "Hey, if you think you can do it," he says weakly. "Anyway, sure, New Rome sounds fine. Let's head in, and if you do well enough, I'll make you a loan, sure.."

"Thanks," says Emily, her voice a little softer. She sounds rather tired, all of the sudden. "Anyhow, I am going to put this dress away and get into something more suitable. It's time to be your pilot again, I guess."

Jack smiles and nods. "Don't sound so down. I was really impressed back there," he remarks. "I had no idea you could sing and perform like that."

Emily smiles, nodding a little and heading to her quarters to get changed. She will carefully set aside her gown and come back out in her far more casual flight suit. "So New Rome it is, huh?" She sets herself at the controls again, "You think Hainzel is going to live to enjoy his sale?"

"I hope so," nods Jack. "We did our best, and he saw no further need for us... but I hope he's okay."

The _Fast Buck_ turns and rolls - a course is set for New Rome. As the ship plies doggedly through space, its crew begin their respective preparations, and make their plans for the upcoming war to be waged on Jack's bank account.
