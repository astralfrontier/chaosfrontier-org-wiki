New Rome, named for the old adage, 'All Roads Lead to Rome' floats serenly in it's calm portion of space. Off in the distance, the swirling patterns of nebulae can be seen, scattered across the depths of space, providing a spectacular view as the _Fast Buck_ exits the trade lane leading to it. Several armed turrets float nearby, weapons bristling on their surfaces... to ensure that no one decides to use their own. As the ship approaches the station, other vessels both Human and Alien can be seen, docking and departing in turn. The station's sensors perform a precursory scan of the _Fast Buck_ shortly before they are hailed with an automated greeting and informational message from New Rome.

Jack briefly tells his automation what to say, then smiles at his pilot. "So, here we are," he observes, unnecessarily. "What's on your agenda, as far as entertainment goes?"

"Hmmm.." Emily taps her lip thoughtfully, "Well, I suppose I should hit the casinos with my nest egg and see if I can start saving myself. I guess it's easier to live with money than without." She looks at Jack curiously, then turns back to the controls, shaking her head, "Anyway, I hope that something good comes of this. Somehow, though, I have this weird feeling that something strange is going to happen."

"That's probably just an overconcentration of ions in the air system," remarks the trader amiably, smiling. "So come on, let's go sample some better air."

Emily stretches and sighs softly, "You know, I don't think I've ever been around a man who hasn't flirted with my constantly. Makes me a bit suspicious, I suppose." She laughs softly and asks, "So what are you going to do here, anyway?"

Shrugging, Jack smiles. "I'll do what I always do -- look for opportunities."

The computer broadcasts its message, and the _Fast Buck_ is guided into the docking pattern. It will be a few minutes before they can dock, traffic is especially heavy at this time. A link to the local datanets can be established in the meantime, to allow the crew to scan the latest news and any other relevant information. The message closes with, "We hope you enjoy your stay on New Rome."

After a few minutes, the ship is brought into docking bay 12-C, in the Oxygen Atmospheric Section. A few maintenance bots are present, ready to perform their duties after the requisite fees have been paid. Leaving the docking bay takes them down to the transit deck. A short bullet-car ride later and they are in the main casino deck.

The Main Casino, New Rome's unofficial claim to fame, is large, elegantly designed, and influenced by a variety of cultures. The sounds of machines and people chattering away provides a nice background noise for any other more private conversations that might take place herein. Several cashiers, for lack of a better word, wait in their prospective areas, exchanging credits for chits to more easily gamble with. In the center of the room, a large holographic display of a planet is shown, with various colors covering different sectors of the continents. Every now and again a victorious shout is picked up, and money exchanged, from somewhere in the casino. As Jack and Emily enter, one lucky Human is busy collecting his winnings. Two Million Credits.

Emily of course dressed-up for this. She explains this to any who might ask by saying, 'One simply does not enter a temple in rags!' And to her, casinos provide what little she knows of religion. 'God loves a winner!' is the first rule. She will exchange 300 credits, then look about for a little while, planning carefully her next move.

The lucky winner exits the casino, even as Emily makes her stunning entrance. The ambient lighting catches her juuust so. Stunning really. As for the opportunistic merchant, it seems as though there are several wealthy types around, many of whom might just be in need of a good pilot. The games beckon to approaching customers with as much a sales pitch as a machine can provide.

Emily makes the rounds, checking out who is who, and of course asking the ladies serving drinks just who the big tippers are. And the big drinkers. She's never above fleecing a drunk out of his money. After all, another commandment of her religion demands that a fool and his money be swiftly parted. Money is just too dangerous in the hands of the careless! She hums some song quietly, looking for just the right game. Something that involves a little skill, decent odds, and a chance to play against someone besides the house.

The ladies serving the drinks aren't eager to give away their mealtickets, but the big drinkers are easy enough to spot. They're the ones near the bar, or the ones with an almost constant stream of waitresses moving to and from them and the bar. Games are easy to find, though many of them are a little unfamiliar to the stunning starfarer. As she walks by a gaming table, she's invited to sit down by a suck-ah-gambler. "We're lookin' for another player... why dontcha join?" Coincidentally enough it's the exact same game she and a Mister Dalion had played, not so long ago...

If there's one truth in all things that Emily holds dear, it is that what comes around, goes around. "You wouldn't mind? I don't suppose you could explain the game to me?" She smiles innocently, eager to help these fine people lighten their load.

"Alright little lady, I'd be glad to fill you in on the rules of the game." As Emily joins the table, the representative of the house begins a new round of the game. "So y'see, the object of the game is to," and the fellow continues on with a very basic, utterly simplistic summary of the game. A smile is on his face as he turns to the other players, "And let the game begin..."

Emily listens closely to the explanation, feigning interest and making questions that show just how very naive she is. She actually enjoys playing dumb, since it makes a fool out of those who buy into it. She has a feeling he's a bit of a trickster himself. Oh well, should make things more entertaining. Besides, it'd be rude not to at least see how good he is.

Emily watches a good hand slip past and she draws the take in, clapping her hands. "This is so very exciting! I didn't realize I'd have so much fun!" She ignores the looks of disapproval and annoyance. She is smart enough not to say 'beginner's luck' at least. Nobody says that except the losers and fakers who aren't very swift.

"Heh, if you think this is fun, I'd say bet a little more..." The one who invited her to sit down offers a sly smile. "It'd make for an interesting game to say the least..." The other players grumble their acceptance, and the house's man begins the game anew. "Shall I deal you in Ma'am?"

Emily nods, laughing softly, "I suppose I might as well try it once more, right?" She won't try too much, but this time she'll play a second round. Two wins should start her off well enough. And a loss will just get her moving on to the next game, probably with about as much as she started with.

Emily rakes in the pot and beams. No matter how they protest, she says simply, "I really must go see what my friend is doing, and I'd like to relax a bit. It has been a lot of fun!" She will collect the take with a happy smile, flirting even in victory. She has followed another cardinal rule of gambling: don't sit in one place too long.

As Emily cashes in her winnings, a woman clad in a simple black dress saunters up to Jack. She studies a palm computer for a moment, before speaking up... in her own particular idiom (( You are Jack Southport, are you not? )) Worn on her dress, is the seal of the mindsmen, identifying her, at least at first glance, as a member of that group.

Jack smiles. (( I am at that, )) he replies in kind, neutrally. (( I am at your service. ))

(( We have need of your services... )) she explains, gesturing towards a nearby gaming table, one that is conveniently abandoned. (( Provided you have no prior contract, of course. Have a seat, and we'll talk. ))

Emily will just park herself at a bar, flirting playfully with waitresses, bartenders, and passersby. She at least can occupy herself for a short while before she starts asking about a lounge where a songbird might sing for her supper. She wants the best, of course, she just doesn't like parting with her precious winnings. Unless clothing is involved.

As the two sit down, the woman places a small device on the table top. A slow invisible field envelops them, causing her and Jack a moment of discomfort as the psionic blocking field encloses them. (( We can speak safely now. )) She goes on to explain that a mindsmen cargo transport has been lost for the past two days. She's unwilling to disclose what it was carrying, though she will tell him where, and the circumstances under which contact was lost with it. It was lost in a region known as the 'badlands' a particle cloud in space known to suffer from frequent ionic disturbances. Salvage operations have been conducted there, though there is no small degree of risk in doing so. Her request is simple, Jack will travel to the last known coordinates and see if he can find the missing ship, and salvage what can be salvaged. Payment is offered at a standard 'Hazardous Operations' rate, with bonuses provided for swift services. (( Of course you are under no obligation to accept this if you do not wish to. ))

Jack nods slowly. (( I will do what I can... but my ship is not rigged for salvage. Is there an advance you can offer me to get properly outfitted? ))

(( Of course. We have offices here in New Rome, report to them and we will advance you some payment, as well as provide you space in one of the maintenance and construction bays post haste. )) The woman nods slowly, her fingers drumming idly across the tabletop.

Jack offers his hand, smiling. (( Then we have a deal. I assume you'll send me mail with a longer summary of conditions and whatever else may be necessary. ))

(( Glad to do business with you. Expect mail soon. In the meantime, enjoy a day or two here in New Rome. )) She deposits a small card on the table, (( This will let you spend up to 5000 credits around the station, and serves as a key to quarters near our offices if you do not wish to sleep aboard your ship during the refit. ))

Jack smiles and nods, saluting smartly as his other hand swipes the card off the table with practiced ease. "I'll be in touch."

(( Of course. )) She returns the salute, stands, and turns to leave.

Emily by this time has found herself in one of the finer clubs. The finest place she can find that has a mic to use and a way to make some tips. It's all about the money and getting attention with her. The rest, well.. it's either trivial or directly related to money or attention.

Jack makes his way in, discreetly as he can, signalling his shipmate and grinning. (( Made five big ones in station credit, )) he transmits with glee. (( And we're getting a free re-fit. We're gonna go salvaging soon, so I could use your help. Think you can dig up information from the sailors and such hereabouts, about where we're heading? ))

Emily sighs. Upstaged again! It's rather disconcerting. She wouldn't be bitter, except she has a feeling Jack won't give her a penny more than he absolutely must. He's not any fun at all! And worse yet, he doesn't even seem to have any interest in flirting with her, thus making getting more money even more difficult. Ultimate rule of gambling: if you have to work hard for it, it's just not worth it. She'll answer as best she can, trying not to reveal her annoyance too much. (( I suppose I can do that, though sailors are usually broke and have very little to lose to the dice. )) Mutter mutter.
