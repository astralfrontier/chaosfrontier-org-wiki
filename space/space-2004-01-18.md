The ship is still approaching, though according to the sensors, it is picking up speed, steadily, levelling off after a few minutes of acceleration. The crew, such as it is, have been working with little sleep and an exponential decrease in whining. It will not be long before salvage #1 is rigged for towing. #2, on the other hand...

The Mindsmen craft takes off, with the survivors aboard, but not before Jack's wrangled the pirate among their number into talking to his computer for awhile. This done, Jack and Emily settle back, working like Trojans to complete the repair work on the pirate craft, while the unknown ship gets closer and closer...

It's only a matter of time before the approaching ship can be subjected to a more detailed scan, even with all of the interference. Of course, the same holds true for Jack's ship... and the computer will report that the ship has just been scanned, quite dutifully to Jack.

Jack notes the alert, then crisply directs Emily to take up position in the _Fast Buck_, before standing by at the wreck's communications board.

Emily moves to the Fast Buck, getting ready to handle.. whatever it is she'll soon have to handle. "This had better be my day," she mutters to herself. She has this thing about dying. She avoids it whenever possible.

From the ship's command deck, Emily will see that the approaching ship is large as well as heavily armed and armored. Although it's more focused on defense than offense. It is, luckily, slower than the _Fast Buck_, or at least at it's current velocity it is.

Continuing repairs while he waits to be hailed, Jack stumbles across a few damaged modules in the ship's power-distribution harness. A few replacements later, he discovers that he's fixed about 60% of the obscure problems that have been plaguing him for the past several hours. Chuckling, he calls Emily back over: "Come on, we might have a chance after all!"

Emily will walk back to the other ship, pretending to be a bit miffed at having to come back. "Jack, you can't just have me walking place to place, going at your beck and call. I'm delicate and need to be taken care of properly."

The ship looms closer, as the minutes and hours slip by. There's a fair amount of time left before it'll be within weapons distance, let alone visual distance. It shows no sign of altering its course or speed just yet. Emily can make her way to the pirate ship easily enough, to find it actually well-lit, for the most part.

Jack says nothing, but continues his work. "They'll be here soon. We may be able to take off before they arrive," he remarks coolly. "Please, just help me for now."

Emily sighs and nods, "Okay, okay, tell me what I'm supposed to do, Jack." And she'll whine and complain about it later. "I don't know how to fix these things, you know."

Jack smiles widely. "That's the spirit!" he announces, then points at the communications board. "I need regular status updates on the other ship, and I want you to stand by on communications in case they try calling us. And umm, start programming an automated evasive course into this ship, in case we need to separate. I want them to worry about who to chase."

Emily nods, grinning to herself. "I think I have a good idea of how to handle that, actually." Diabolic minds like hers shouldn't be allowed to do things like this. "Let's see.. how to deal with them.." She'll keep the updates coming, and also begin to plan a pattern of evacuation. "A pity there's nothing horribly dangerous around," she murmurs to herself.

The ship is scanning the area that the _Fast Buck_ is situated in, as Emily runs the sensors. It's a rather deep scan this time, probing into the cargo bays. After a few minutes, just as Emily finishes programming her piloting sequence in fact, the ship alters course and begins accelerating.

The approaching unidentified ship is now headed on a course that will take it past the two salvaged ships, instead heading after the escaping Mindsmen ship.

"Well, looks like they are going after our castaways," says Emily. She cracks her knuckles and hmms, "Not that this is really the best news. I was rather hoping they'd just go back the way they came."

Jack throws up his hands. "How many people we got in this volume of space, anyhow?" he demands, apparently of the universe at large. "Okay, Em. Broadcast our pirate friend's recorded hail for me, please? It's what anyone in our situation would do."

Emily nods to Jack and sends out the hail. "Here's hoping we don't have to shoot anyone today," says Emily. She doesn't sound very confident, though. "How many guns we have on this thing?" She is just, ya know.. curious.

As if on cue, the communications board will chime in, alerting Emily to the three more sensor contacts it has detected.

"Jack, I think your little idea isn't precisely working," says Emily. "They are scanning us like mad. If this keeps up, they'll know what color underwear I have on." Black, actually.

Jack rolls his eyes. "Let them scan," he announces firmly. "They're in no position to tag us yet."

With no immediate danger, despite Emily's warnings, Jack resumes repairs. A few hours are required for completion, and the man doesn't relent in his efforts - this is, after all, how he started life, and then as now, his life was on the line if he failed to keep the systems under his control in proper working order.

Emily will head back with Jack into the Fast Buck, and with a little bit of tweaking, get ready to run both ships simultaneously. She has done things like this before, and she is going to make it appear like both ships are piloted and ready to deal with overly curious followers. Weapons are readied and the ships move off together, making for the gate. "I have that auto-pilot ready in a pinch, but I think if they get too close I'd like to try and chop their noses off first," she says flatly.

There's an incoming hail from the familiar-seeming ship, the one Jack and Emily have had a run-in with before. It's a flat neutral request for information as to the situation at hand, and whether aid is required. Meanwhile the larger ship continues its slow acceleration, continuing to follow the erratic course of the mindsmen's ship. As if that weren't enough, Jack and Emily will both feel a sort of sickening wave pass through them, followed by the audible sound of a scream coming from someplace nearby.

Jack presses a button. "The Mindsmen got away, and we were pretty beat up, so I am using this ship for parts." Another. "Anyway, I'll be done in a few hours, and I can handle this."

"What the hell was that?" says Emily, staying focused. "You gonna check on it?" Since she's a bit busy and all.

A recorded response from the freighter, "Okay thanks for the information. We'll be on our way now." There is no further communication from the ship, although Jack will be able to pick up the echos of another message hidden in that broadcast.

Jack frowns. He taps commands into his board, then turns in the _Fast Buck_'s copilot's swivel seat to look at his accomplice. "Weird shit," he announces. "Keep flying, keep a sharp eye out. I'm checking the ship..."

Jack grabs his multiscanner and jumps out of the seat, after a few seconds of scanning. "I'll look into it!" he announces loudly, then begins running...

Huddled arounda small metallic box, no more than 2 feet in any of its dimensions, is the body of the telepath who had contacted Jack. He doesn't look it, but according to the multiscanner he should still be alive. Barely.

Emily sighs and does just that. "I wonder what the hell is going on now. This better also count as hazard pay." Does she get hazard pay? "We better get this thing back in one piece, too."

Jack yells loudly. "Emily! If the Mindsmen ship is in communications range still, tell them to verify their telepath! No acceleration for a few seconds, ship's gravity being disabled!" He shuts down the artificial gravity, then begins hauling the now-weightless telepath toward his medical bay - which basically consists of a table near a supply of common medicinal drugs.

After a few minutes of fruitless effort, Jack realizes he's a trader, not a doctor. In desperation he lays a hand on his patient's brow, beginning the process of fusing two minds together.

Emily sends out a message to the Mindsmen, "Heya gents, this probably sounds a bit odd, but could you do a little favor for me? You know that telepath, could you make sure that he's there? And maybe if he is, make sure he is your telepath?" Stranger things have happened, right?

"Well that's strange m'lady, oh Queen of Known Space," replies the pirate, after a minute or two has passed, "I could've sworn we took him with us my liege, but it seems that ah, he's gone and wandered off somewhere instead. And it looks like we're picking up company your highness..."

"Indeed, loyal servant, I fear indeed for your health," replies Emily. "If my squires wish to flee, I'll understand. After all, I cannot be worshipped properly by dead men, now can I? It seems we've picked-up your stray, though I'm not quite sure just how yet."

"Alright then your Queenliness. We'll do our best to evade these lot. If you're ever in the Britannia system, look us up. We'll give you a proper coronation and everything. Or if nothing else, a safe place to hide." With that, the fleeing ship begins making evasive maneuvers, "Best of luck to you, and God save the Queen."

"The Queen needs only luck to save her, my dears," says Emily. She'll just ease back, then, and call out after Jack, "So what's going on, anyway? You going to get back up here or what?"

The fusing of the two minds is not terribly difficult. The telepath is offering no resistance to Jack's probing mind. Nor is he offering any sort of protest. His mindscape is one left blasted and barren, it would seem, conscious thought a thing of mere ghosts of thoughts and images. Jack will get the distinct sensation of each and everyone of his senses being suddenly overwhelmed by an overtaxing exhaustion as well.

Unsatisfied, the telepath delves deeper, taxing himself and weaving the myriad strands of his own thought with those he can feel reaching out from the other mind. He's only dimly aware of Emily's attempt to talk to him, and for the moment he chooses to concentrate on the mind of the victim on his table. Slowly his mind synchronizes with that of the other, and his conscious self delves into the layers of thought beneath the surface.

As Jack reaches deeper and deeper into the layers of the telepath's mind, the scenery, so to speak, is not quite as barren. The quiet ordering of the body provides a background to the deeper layers of thought. (( Who's there? I am. I must protect it. I must seal it. Must not let others find out. Who's there? Who's walking around my mind? )) the telepath's thoughts are feint, and laden with images and stray thoughts of places here and in the past. Those of the day before are clear, with the memories of the telepath cloaking himself from the mind of others becoming particularly strong.

The memory of the scanner sweeps passing through, and the psychic energy being expended to block himself and the box from the scan are prevalent, to the point where it finally takes its heavy toll on the telepath... and the sudden, altogether strange and alien surge of psychic power rippling across his mind, burning and burying thoughts deep inside his mind, leaving him scattered and unconscious in its wake. Something had him terrified, though it's not clear what.

Jack reflects on the feelings and sensations he's receiving. Carefully he transmits the notion of another Mindsman - himself - examining the contents, to study the manner in which his subject's mind reacts to the thought.

The thought sparks a good deal of relief from the unconscious telepath, the feeling one gets when a particularly tough job has been completed, and there's nothing left to worry about for the weekend except which sport team will win the latest playoffs.

Jack probes more, seeking to elicit an answer to how the man came to be aboard the _Fast Buck_ after the other vessel left.

The memory of suggesting to the others that he had in fact gone aboard the other ship springs to mind, along with the pride felt upon accomplishing just that.

Having learned what he could, Jack withdraws slowly, using a dose of the drug Suspend to put his patient into metabolic suspension. Medical supplies came with the refit that the Mindsmen offered him, and now Jack expresses silent, heartfelt gratitude for the inclusion. "Emily," he reports in a soft voice, upon returning to the bridge. "We've got to get back. It's become more urgent."

"What? More urgent than staying alive?" asks Emily. To her, that's pretty damn urgent. "I hadn't really planned on getting stranded or killed out here, Jack, so I'm not precisely stunned by this desire to get back, but rather by your slow arrival at the conclusion." She's so good, she can pilot two ships and be a smartass at the same time.

Jack chuckles softly. "Alright, I earned that one," he says. "Now, since you have all the answers," he adds, grinning, "tell me who the hell all these people are, and what they want with that box in the back."

"Does it matter? We have it, they want it, we want it more. That's all that matters, eh?" Emily goes on, "I like to keep it nice and simple. Of course, if they want this so bad.. it must be worth a fortune! I say we send out a call for an auction. That way we can get paid and they can kill each other over the box. Heck, maybe they'll all blow each other down and we can get the box again! Or we could just run and try to live."

"Do you ever keep friends for more than a dozen days?" asks Jack querulously.

"That depends how well they pay me," answers Emily. She can't help but grin, "Have I struck a chord, my dear Jack? Honestly, you need to learn to relax."

Sighing, Jack shrugs. "Sure, I'll relax. I'll relax by going back to open that box. But first..."

"Jack, I'm not going to let my loy.. err, our friends on that ship get hurt. If they are all so damn interested in this stupid box, let's show them just who has it. I will not sit around and watch them kill those guys just to protect us." Emily actually sounds huffy and angry, ready to crush an argument with sheer force of temper and pouting if necessary.

Jack nods quickly. "Do it," he says, curtly. "Those bastards will need to decelerate something awful to swing back for us, if that's what they're really after."

After being mooned, tthe unidentified ship in hot pursuit of tthe mindsmen alters course once more, losing speed as it makes a few quick corrections to try to plot an intercept course. It will be some time before tthe larger ship will even be able to dream about moving into weapons range. Tthe _Fast Buck_ has the advantage, clearly.

Jack checks and double-checks his sensor readings, then grins widely. "Great work, Em," he remarks. "Now, let's see what's in the box.."

"You sure that's a great idea?" says Emily. "After all, who knows what is in that thing...?"
