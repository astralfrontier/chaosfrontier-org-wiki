Jimmy Dalion, the picture of Emily's Spite, a loud-mouthed fellow with angry blue eyes and an almost perpetual stupid expression on his face... is currently standing across from Emily. He's not pleased to see her in person, but is making the best of it. That is to say he's gloating. Sort of. "So... you'll help me get my boys outta that rent-a-wreck of a jail, and I'll consider part of what ya owe me cleared."

"Wrong," says Jack. "First, we find out just what all this is about. Which means you consent to telepathic examination. THEN we help you get your boys out. THEN we see what comes next."

Emily just crosses her arms and waits for the first opportunity to space Jimmy. She will leave it to Jack, for now. At worst, it proves to her once and for all that every bad deed goes unpunished. She asides to Jack, "If he takes one wrong breath.."

"Sure thing boss," remarks Jimmy. "Ya want to gimme a brainjob, then by all means poke around in there and see what you can dig up. I have no problem with it. My, word, you could just ask me. I'd be truthful. I do suppose I am asking a major favor of you though."

Jack nods. "Alright. Sit down, blank your mind, and relax," he suggests, then places a hand on the temple of the other man. Carefully he begins probing, relaxing and concentrating on meshing the tapestry of his mind with the inner universe of his subject.

Jack starts talking, quietly. "Alright, Jimmy. Just so we know who owes who what, tell me about your involvement with Em here. Please be thorough." As he speaks, his mind slides through the folded layers of thought, synchronizing itself and its recollections with that of the mind it touches.

"Alright," says the man. He starts talking. "It was a while back, Emily and I were engaged in a friendly game." He smiles, and Jack will get a mental association along the lines of 'She owes me for takin' out my ships. Hurting my boys. That and the cheating. "We had been playing for a while, and this... person..." Jack will sense several colorful words associated with Emily, "Decided to cheat me." IN other words, that had to have been it, there's no way she could have won so much without. "We caught her." Im fact they did, "And my boys put a gun to her back and took back our money. We let her live. More'n we should've."

"So you actually caught her cheating? Or you simply deduced from her winnings that she cheated?" asks Jack, curiously.

Emily will still restrain herself. Besides, she can shoot Jimmy any time now. Or just doctor up his suit..

"Well it wasn't me that caught her cheating. It was Sammy Two-Eyes that spotted the ace up her sleeve." As far as Mr. Dallion is concerned this is true. Especially since she had a reuptation as a swindler and a heartbreaker. "So then, we took back what was ours. Or so we thought. Turns out she stole a bunch, took off with you, and was responsible for the destruction of my personal private property. Three ships legitimately owned." Never mind that he's probably going to claim insurance on them as soon as he makes sure that all the paperwork on the now-destroyed ships is legal. "So ya see, she owes me." And to Jimmy, if she gets away with this, it will disrupt his entire scheme of control. And there is a lot riding on him retaining his reputation.

Jack nods slowly. "And if this Sammy played you false, what would happen?" he asks, almost conversationally.

"Sammy? Well if he were caught lyin' to me, I'd have to learn him a thing or... uh... the thing after one... two." Jimmy chuckles at his own humor. Sammy of course would be killed in many interesting ways.

"Uh-huh. And in that event, what about Emily?" continues Jack. "Would she be restituted? Or are you the sort of man who doesn't pay a debt?"

Emily snorts and turns away. Reasoning with Jimmy Dalion and not even beating him to the edge of death is enough to make her sick. Not to mention her money's probably gone..

"I always pay my debts. She'd still owe me for the ships, but I'm sure that we could come to some sort of compromise." There's something about Emily's name that invokes a sort of furious passionate anger in him. Probably the same as Emily might be feeling.

Frowning, Jack presses. "How do you figure she would owe you for ships destroyed on the word of another man, if he really was lying, or was just mistaken?"

"Mistakes happen. She didn't have to go and get my ships blowed up. Replacing them is going to cost me money I don't have. Money she owes me." Jimmy smiles, "'Sides, if she hadn't run away everything could've been cleared up." Yeah. Right.

"Let me guess, Jimmy. Someone else who isn't completely worthless at the tables cleaned you out, you decided to steal your way back into comfort, and that's how your collection of village idiots got caught?" asks Emily. "Everybody knew you couldn't earn a penny on your own."

Jimmy turns and snarls at Emily, "You lyin' sonofa... er.. daughter of a..." He glares, curses her some with language no one polite would ever say. "I earned my own money the hard old fashioned way." By lying and stealing. Or something along those lines. An honest living, certainly. At least in that he prides himself on not cheating. That's what his boys do.

"Jimmy, if you aren't careful I'm going to make this all a very moot point. Remember, I can break your arms and put a hole in your head. I've always been stronger than you." says Emily. Her voice is suddenly calm, which probably is a very bad sign.

Jimmy smiles. "Yeah. I know. You probably could." There's an eerie smugness about this statement. Jack gets the phrase 'Contingency Plan' from this.

Meanwhile, Jack breaks off telepathic contact, and hails his fellow telepaths' society members aboard their ship. "Ladies and gentlemen, the Mindsmen payment I called in will be considered repaid in full," he says to the plate, "if you'll go snag someone called 'Sammy Two-Eyes' and have him consent to a full and poignantly detailed telepathic examination, about the matter of his accusations of cheating by this woman, named Emily. Tell him Jimmy Dalion will be after him if he refuses to cooperate." The spacer turns. "Jimmy, I trust you'll vouch for me on this?"

Emily snorts, muttering something about "blood from a stone." Still, there is the matter of current payment. "This all in theory could handle the past," she says, obviously not believing it at all, "But what about now?"

"Of course I will." Jimmy smiles. "I trust my boys. So we'll have yer brainiac friends go find 'im. Tell 'em to slug him hard if he's lyin'. But save some for me."

"Just a probe, and comprehensive results," mutters Jack to the other ship. He shrugs a bit. "Alright. We'll see what the truth is. In the meantime, I'll do what I can. Emily?"

The Mindsmen ship returns the hail. "Alright Mr. Southport. Where shall we pick up this... Sammy Two-Eyes?"

"What?" asks Emily. "You got yourself in this mess. Jimmy's bad luck. The only time he's a good bet is when he can cheat (and he does so poorly) or when he's got someone outnumbered about 20 to 1. Neither is the case here."

Once Jimmy's relayed what he knows, Jack closes the channel. "Alright then," he says, removing his glasses to rub the bridge of his nose with a finger and thumb for a moment. "Look. He did you dirty, you did him back, everybody hates everybody. Can we all try to work together for once? So just maybe nobody will have a problem with anyone?"

Jimmy turns to Jack, "Do you see what I have to put up with from her? I come to her with onest legitimate complains and she insults me more'n I do. I'm pityin' ya seein' how she's hiding out on your ship. You have mah deepest sympathies."

Emily rolls her eyes, "Yeah, you guys deserve each other," she comments flatly. "I have yet to see any profit in this."

"Well the profit, if'n you end up not owing me anything," continues Jimmy, although it's clear that she won't end up this way. "Is the supplies they're bound to have aboard that rent-a-wreck. Ain't never been used by a livin' soul, likely won't be used again. 'Sides they'll be due for a resupply anyway."

"You will, you will," mumbles Jack, before turning to the gangster. "Play nice. Shut up. Be a nice guy. Okay? We're in. Emily, I'll give you a hundred thousand out of my own pocket, unless you clear at least that much when we're done. Now do we have a deal?"

Emily actually pauses for a while. She could make that much in a few weeks of gambling and wouldn't involve being near Jimmy.. "I might as well, there's the off chance Jimmy will get fragged, and that'd make it all worth while."

Jimmy shuts up. Decides not to say anything further for the time being. At least until Jack's done. "So what'er we waitin' on? Let's go get my boys."

Jack smiles. "Okay then."

It's a private security company's prison. It's far from the state of the art, technologically advanced jails in the more civilized world, but it is a step up from the standard rent-a-cop's holding tank. These private companies, Jimmy will say, are the missing link between the two. Easy in, easy out. All it takes is disabling the security grid. There should be a few guards... but they're incompetent according to Jimmy. At present, the three jailbreakers are outside, surveying this place from a high hill on a terraformed moon. "So all we do is waltz in, act like techs, get to the grid, and get out. I'm sure you can deal with that? Yeah?"

"Yep. This is the stupidest thing I've ever gotten involved in," says Emily. "How about we just turn ourselves into the guards, tell them the whole plan, and shorten our sentences?"

Jack shrugs. "Well as plans go, it's pretty lacking. Why don't I just go in and authorize you two to enter legally?"

"Sure. That or I go in and start shooting people," says Emily. "Oh, wait, that's right, the only one I want to actually shoot is the guy I'm helping."

"You can get us in legally?" Jimmy turns and looks at Jack... "I cannot believe that..."

"And I can't believe that bullshit story about 'Emily owes me money, whine whine whine'," retorts Jack rather loudly. "So shut up already. Anyway, you two should stand by for contact, okay?"

"Sounds good," says Emily. "Let's try not to get arrested. I don't feel like trying to squirm my way out of this place."

"Alright. Go on then." Jimmy stands back, waits to see what Jack will do.

Jack departs; once out of sight of his companions, he dons the skinsuit's air-filled 'helmet' and begins teleporting, darting from point to point as he draws closer and closer to the control center of the jail.

Jack crouches out of sight as best he can, spending the next thirty minutes engaged in the subtlest aspects of telepathy he can muster. The guards may not be the sharpest tacks in the drawer, but even an average man can discern clumsy attempts to go en rapport with him. Twinges of guilt for his actions delay Jack's reading attempts, but he persists, finally engaging in the level of rapport he requires - the memory of one guard, spread out for his inspection.

This done, Jack retains contact with the targeted mind, all the while slowly and carefully operating his own computer. Its wireless rig interfaces with that of the facility, and Jack keeps in close proximity to his captive mind, wary of the slightest hint of suspicion or alarm.

Twenty minutes later, Emily receives a coded signal telling her to come alone and present herself as an officer of the law - her authorization will be received and processed by the computer. But it'll be up to her people skills to convince the human element, if they are at all suspicious. For Jack's part, he'll stay in contact with his chosen guard, and prepare to relay to Emily any suspicions or doubts that may arise.

Emily sighs and shakes her head. "I can't believe I'm doing this. I'm working hard for my bad karma." She will go to it, though. She makes her way towards the entrance of the prison, looking rather bored and disinterested. She waits for a guard to notice her and sighs. "Here for a pick-up. I guess you have some rats for me," she says with the practiced boredom of an old hand. "I should be expected."

The guard at the entrance, who has the unfortunate last name of Paluka, greets Emily. "Er... ah... you're the exterminator? Sure... we've been having the worst vermin problem. I think they're comin' in from around back... miss uh..."

"Emily," she says, sounding even more bored. "I'm here to pick up prisoners," she adds. "You know, bad people you put in a cell so they can't have fun or bug people?" With enemies like this..

"Er... to pick up prisoners?" The guard scratches his head, "I don't think so. We'd know if there was such an order. Uhm... lemme check at the front." He then speaks into a radio. "Yeah? A transfer request. 'Swhat she said. I know. Check anyway will ya? Mozer's been slackin' off at the desk these days..."

Emily can certainly look the part of the apathetic worker. She heaves a sigh and looks like she's barely got enough energy to even stay on her feet as she waits for the imbeciles to find the fake order. "Oh yeah, last name is Anderson." Actually, that's just yet another alias. At this point, Emily barely remembers her real last name.

"Alright. Well... they says you're cleard. Miss Anderson." The guard opens the doors, "In ya go. Be careful, some of 'em are right mean. They'll bite your legs off as soon as look at you."

"Right," says Emily. And in she goes, looking for a group of particularly stupid-looking men.

Most of them are nowhere to be seen. Presumably they're in the actual holding cells. A gunmetal steel building holds the lot of them, it would seem. The quiet hum of electronic security is ever present. As are the ten guards stationed in the lobby of their... facility. Some of them even have small arms. The rest... well, rocket launchers are mostly just for show.

Emily is going to rely wholly on Jack to give her whatever info she needs. She pauses by a guard, "Here for the pick-up.. I'm going to guess they're not ready."

"No. They're not. It's a funny thing," remarks the guard behind what passes for a desk. Jack will sense a growing suspicion. "We hadn't even noticed it 'til just now..."

"Figures, damn big shots never keep their crap in order. I was looking forward to a long weekend, but then they wake me up to go to the middle of nowhere and pick some guys up." Emily frowns and lets out another sigh, "This had better have a point, that's all I'm going to say."

From his private vantage point, Jack frowns. It wouldn't take much to adjust this guard's memories. But he's transgressed far enough; if Emily can't handle this, it's time to withdraw.

The guard has a look of not quite buying it. "Uh-huh. Look complain about the big shots all you like lady. What's your name and authorization code? Which prisoners are you supposed to transfer?"

Emily actually pouts, looking sullen for a moment. After delivering the requested information she turns her eyes up at the guard, "Why are you being so mean to me?" she asks, "I'm just trying to be my job, there's no need to be so unfriendly." She leans just enough to give the guard a most remarkable view down her shirt. If Jack's fishing in this guy's head, he'll probably pick up all sorts of fun thoughts.

"Ma'am," says the fellow, whose gaze remains unwavering. Despite the fact that two of his companions are looking where they oughtn't. "I understand you're trying t do yours. I'm just trying to do mine. I am not being unfriendly. This is me being friendly."

Meanwhile, Jack will note that the suspicions are gradually lifting. Although the guard seems to be aware of Emily's attempt to bamboozle him. That the information matches allays most of his suspicions. It's then that he smiles, "It all checks out. I can be even more friendly now. Carl, go get the rats." He turns to Emily, "They'll be out in a minute."

"I just hope they don't smell," murmurs Emily. She waits with a more vacant expression, occasionally moving in such a way as to keep the minds of the men occupied with her, rather than anything else.

In short order the prisoners are brought back out. Unconscious. At least, with any luck they are. They are also restrained quite effectively. "Alright. Everything checks out. You'll sign the dotted line, I'm sure. Good riddance to bad rubbish."

Emily signs the dotted line and gets what she was here for. "Well, let's go, trash rats," she says flatly, taking her unpleasant load of human cargo away.

Emily remotely operates the _Fast Buck_, setting it down nearby, and without much difficulty wrangles her charges on board. Jack arrives as well, bridging the distance of space more easily. He strides to the bridge and sits down, tapping out instructions to contact Jimmy Dalion by radio.

Jimmy radios back, "Yeah? What do ya want? Didja get 'em out yet? Are we supposed to flee? What?"

"First, let's discuss something, Jimmy," says Jack, almost purring as he sits back in his chair. "The facility's computer system is scheduled to play back a recording of your offer to us to arrange a jailbreak, in a matter of days. It can be disabled, and will be, provided nothing untoward happens between us. Do we have an understanding?"

"Of course we have an understanding. Geez. I suppose it's rather like the sort of recording I've uploaded to th newsnets informing them of our dealings, which of course will be disabled that nothing untoward happens to me. No offense to you, but I don't trust Emily one bit."

Jack shrugs. "You're welcome aboard, then, or as welcome as you'll ever be."

"I reckon. Alright." And with that Jimmy boards the ship, collects his men, and will be ready to leave. He'll be all too glad to leave Emily's presence, though not before informing him that she only owes him for one ship for helping him and his boys out of this fix.

Jack smiles. "So, previously, you considered the other ships write-offs, and Emily owed you a debt on them entirely?"

Emily just stays quiet, but she's getting more and more angry as she listens to this crap. She's got no small amount of rage at being connect and bullied into helping a man who robbed her blind and who will never return what he stole.

"I have not yet considered them write-offs. Each and every single one was dear and near to me. I'll never have 'em fitted the way they were again... such trauma is damagin' to my fra-gyle psyche." Jimmy smiles. "Still it's just th' one."

"We'll see how fragile your psyche is soon enough," mumbles Jack. "Now, make arrangements to GET OFF MY SHIP."

"Alright." It takes a few minutes, and Jimmy and the rest of his gang are on their way back to their ship. It will turn tail and run, hightailing it out of the system as fast as its engines can carry it.

"Well, that's over. I think I'm going to throw up now," says Emily. "And then soak in lye for a few hours." She's still bristling over that whole vile affair.

Jack enacts a credit transfer of a hundred thousand, just as he promised. "Now, come on," he says softly. "We've got ship upgrades to finish, and you have money to enjoy."

"Pride's worth more than money, Jack," says Emily evenly. "It's not so easy to get back. Now it's everywhere that I just served as Jimmy's little lap dog, fearing him. It's not money that can fix that. I have to kill him the next time I see him."

---

Elsewhere, in a room lit by the soft glow of a single red light are two men, dressed in simple grey suits. "They have been here," remarks one of them, his voice a clipped, emotionless, knife-edge. "We will find them," says the other, in an almost identical voice. "Agreed. But first, there is the matter of removing the witnesses." Then the light fades, there is a scuffling sound, and suddenly, for a brief moment, the vacuum is filled with a few more bodies. If Jack and Emily were to see this, they would recognize the faces of their 'friends' from the Badlands.

---

When the _Fast Buck_ heads back for its retrofit, it will find a message waiting for it. "Mr. Southport, Sammy Two-Eyes left this establishment some time ago. We are currently in pursuit. Please leave a rendezvous location with Mindsmen Central HQ, and we will meet when we find him."

Jack reads the message, setting his ship to relay the docking message of its current port, once every standard day. "Should be good enough," he says to himself, relaying the news to Emily as well. "We'll see how it turns out."

"Yeah, sure," Emily replies. It doesn't matter at all, to her. She has no faith in any source of law or justice, save her own weapons.

Zinaida is also waiting for the _Fast Buck_. With open arms. "My friends! Is good to see you back," so goes his hailing message. "We have kept dock for you. And rooms. Is for free for you, good businessman like yourself, and I have bouncers reserve special place in bar for you."

For himself, Jack is content to observe - and comment - on the refitting job taking place aboard his ship. The engineering spaces are expanding, and he's losing almost 20% of his cargo volume to make way for the new engines. As it stands, though, simply moving mass through space is looking less profitable than the other ventures of late, and this doesn't bother him overly much. The principal problem now is power - or lack of it. Jack peers mournfully at a selection of fusion reactors; there's nothing in his price range at this point, and silently he mumbles curses at himself for not being a cannier merchant with Dalion.

The message from the Mindsmen ship comes in. It arrives with a rather urgent stamp attatched to it. "Jack... they're dead. They're all... dead. Their bodies... oh good god... their bodies. They're... Jack, I don't know how I survived. You've got to help me. Please. I'm at..." There's half a set of coordinates given, and then the message cuts itself off. Given the coordinates, they can't be too far from where the _Fast Buck_ is currently docked.

Dragging Emily back aboard post-haste, her winnings intact, Jack gets to work learning whatever he can, peering at newsfeeds and shoving his sensors to the limit of their detection range. "We need to get out there pronto!"

Emily sighs, not even bothering to change clothes. "Jack, I'm beginning to think you are rotten luck," she says flatly. The woman frowns in thought, "And I've won enough to pay back most of that little loan of yours. I'm not taking money for that Dalion crap. I want no part of it."

There isn't much on the newsfeeds, save for a lessened military presence. While it is still a visible presence in the more civilized systems, a majority of the ships have been recalled to their previous postings. As far the sensors go, they will pick up on the Mindsmen ship. At the edge of sensor range. It looks to be badly damaged. Almost total systems malfunction if the sensors are reading it right.

As the _Fast Buck_ draws nearer, Jack scowls at the glowing screen before him. The extent of the ship's malfunctioning systems is disturbing. One life-sign alone, and no normal way to reach him... Frowning, he tells the distant ship's own communicator to re-broadcast his signal, on the assumption whoever's left is in a vacc suit. Their suit radio should receive him.. "Come in, disabled vessel."

A shaky, strained voice responds. "This is disabled vessel. Do you read?" The sound of a vacc suit breather is prominent in the background.

"Yes, I hear you," responds Jack. "Get to an airlock immediately and activate your homing beacon, we're coming to pick you up."

"This is not looking right at all," Emily murmurs. She focuses on piloting and keeping an eye out for trouble. She's going to make sure the weapons are ready for whatever might be flying the way of the ship. "You think we should tow the ship, too? This is weird."

"I can't. Can't move. Can't get door open. Power's gone. Emergency lighting is gone. I'm pinned." The voice strains a bit more. "I think I can get loose. Maybe. Can you do anything to help?"

"Jack, can you find out exactly where he is?" asks Emily. She does a little double-checking of the weapon system. "Maybe I can make him a way out."

Jack relays his readings of the internal environment to Emily's board, before continuing his conversation. "Are you pinned under mass, or bodily injured?" he asks. "I can disable artificial gravity from here, if necessary, and you should be able to manually operate the airlock pressure-doors."

"Both." The voice gives a rueful chuckle. "I was bodily injured when the mass fell on me. If you can get rid of gravity... I'll try and blast the door open. Get to the airlock doors."

Jack works on disabling artificial gravity, frowning. What accident could require the doors to be blasted open? Whatever happened, it's a considerably worse accident than he's ever been in.

Jack coordinates with Emily's efforts, examining schematics of the ship and highlighting sections before 'sliding' the data over to her control board. He continues transmitting and re-transmitting commands to the crippled hulk beyond, telling it to shut down the gravity that's pinioning the remaining survivor.

"Okay... it worked. I'm free. Going to try blasting my way out." There is silence for a few minutes. "Door's fused. Hang on." Another moment of silence or two, followed by, "I'm through." Shortly thereafter, there is a scream. Followed by the sounds of sobbing, "Ohgodohgodohgodohgodohgod..."

Emily focuses on what she's doing, trying to ignore the rather unhinged cries of their target. As Jack pulls open the airlock, she yanks the ship away, not just to move in front of the flying speck that is the man she would save, but to move just barely less than his speed, lest his impact kill him instantly. Just to show off, she pivots the ship and opens a lock on the ship, going for the whole thing in one fell swoop.

"We have yet another stray," murmurs Emily softly, bringing the ship back and around. "I think you might want to look in on him, though. Should I get ready to tow that thing, or get this guy to a hospital?"

Jack nods. "I'm going," he says over his shoulder, rising. "Rig for towing."

The vacc suited man is recovering, slowly, by the time Jack gets down to him. He looks up, barely climbing out of the suit. "They're dead. They... I heard the screams... I could never imagine..."

Emily gets the ship into position and prepares to tow. "This job isn't very glamorous," she murmurs softly. "All these ugly situations.." She sighs, studying the other ship as much as she can. She wonders how they were damaged to that extent, looking for some sign of breeching.

"You better take it easy," recommends Jack, coming abreast of his visitor. "Now, let's hear it, slowly, from the beginning."

"Alright... alright..." The visitor takes a moment or two to compose himself. "We were on the tail of Two-Eyes. We'd gotten a tip from a merchant, said he'd seen him pass this way..." He breathes in, slowly. "We picked up a distress call. Went to go let another ship aboard. Only two... only two life forms. Then, everything shut down. There were shots, and when the firing stopped, the... the screams started. I ran. Ran for my chambers, sealed the door, fused it. The ship lurched, and crates fell on me... the screams.. oh..."

The visitor looks up at Jack. "Their eyes. They are all blood red. Like they've been crying blood. They look drained. Brain fried. Dead." He shudders. "It's terrible. Never seen anyone dead before."

Jack frowns. "Did they have minds or feelings? Did you get anything from their minds?" he asks, sounding concerned.

"I couldn't. They were screamers. It hurt to try to find them. It hurt." The man shakes back and forth. "Couldn't break through it."

Meanwhile, Emily will perform one of the most in depth scans ever recorded in recent history. She will not only discover the subtle traps left aboard the ship that activated when the airlock doors cycled, she will discover the microtransmitter left aboard the ship. She will also find that the hull, and almost everything else about the ship is intact, it's just dead systems-wise. She'll find out who built it, and will likely be able to trace the traps and transmitter back to their component sources. She'll also note the strange frequency that seems to be popping up on the scanners. It's operating at the extreme range of their detection, and as she scans the ship, the frequency just sort of dies down.

"Jack, I'm not touching that thing with a 10 parsec pole," fires Emily over the transmitters. "It's rigged." She's already pulling the ship very far away with more than a bit of haste. "If you want to stick your hand in a bee's nest, you are welcome to after I get off this bucket," she adds. "Whatever took that thing over is pretty damn crafty. Next to nothing is damaged, just that everything is shut off."

"I hear you," says Jack. He turns to his guest. "I trust you guys can handle this on your own. Our business in this system is concluded; you want the experts to come take a look at your ship now."

"Yeah. We do. Can you take me back to port at least?" The guy sits up, takes deeper breaths. "This is twice now you've saved my life. I owe you."

Jack shakes his head. "Whoever came for you guys knew how to hit you, it sounds like. We're taking no chances. Emily, get us out of the system ASAP, we'll find a nice safe haven to dock at. One with a good hospital. Hipe!"
