Archer glances up at the sound of the shot coming over the radio, and is up and moving almost immediately. "Talk to us, Jiro. What's happening?" He shoves a clip into his pistol as he runs.

Taking to cover, Jiro replies tersely, "Robot. Laser. Standby."

Jiro crouches behind a piece of machinery and changes his sensors to thermographic mode. An angry, glowing scar marks the wall behind him, where the laser struck. His assailant must be behind cover, because the hot glow of the barrel isn't visible... yet.

Jiro hears the machine move before he sees it, a quiet wirring barely more audible than the thumping of his own hear, and a lozenge-shaped machine with four spindly legs pops around a corner. The hot muzzle of a large-bore laser glows a bright yellow in his thermographic filter, and then a bright white flash emerges.

From his cover, Jiro returns fire, chancing a single anti-personnel round to see how he fares. The round tags the alloy skin of the thing beyond, and Jiro frowns to himself as he switches cartridges.

Unwilling to wait for the mechanical threat to escalate, Jiro emptys a clipful of armor-piercing explosive rounds from his gyroc. Ten rounds hiss out of the barrel in the space of a second, most of them striking home as the robot tries to cross from behind the cover of one machine to another. There's muffled explosions as the miniature guided missles bore into the thing's armor plating, and it flips onto its back, its four legs splayed out like a squashed bug.

Archer winces at the explosions from the bay ahead. "Jiro? You still with us?"

A moment later, dim white emergency lights come to life high on the walls of the cavern. The area is bathed in a murky glow, the lights picking out twists of smoke in the air both from the barrel of Jiro's gyroc, and the smashed body of some kind of robot fifty yards away.

Quickly the warrior-cleric drops a cassette from his rocket carbine, slapping another into place in the space of a heartbeat. "Robot, one down, maybe more," he reports crisply. "Oi, status on internal sensors."

Archer slips his pistol back into its holster as he arrives. "What a mess..."

By the time the pilot appears on the scene, Jiro is already gesturing in the air, watching the results of his manipulations on his helmet HUD. The night-vision gun camera flashed once for each round fired, and he examines each image carefully.

The seconds crawl by slowly, and all is silent inside the empty building. The smell of burnt metal and electronics penetrates even your breathing masks. The emergency lights are illuminating the neglected machinery, but in the dry, cool confines of the cavern, it looks as if this place was abandoned yesterday, rather than a century ago.

"Oi, I'm workin on it, give me some time." Oi gives a frustrated sigh, and taps at the keyboard, trying to get the sensor's corrupted code to work again. "Try not to get killed in the interim."

Archer waits for Jiro to finish. "Any sign of more of them?"

A composite from Jiro's gun-camera logs shows a robot with a smooth lozenge-shaped body, four spidery legs at the corners, and a small turret on top. A glowing laser barrel sticks out of the turret, with a larger, shorter bore than a typical laser rifle.

Leandra slips out of the coffin and moves out to get near Jiro and Archer. "No one is hurt?" she asks calmly. She is going to have to take a look at that robot, too, once it is clear that her crewmates are in one piece.

"Gah. 'Ay! What's goin' on? These sensors aren't being nice. Hang on, I'll try and get them going again. Smile everyone," says Oi, "You're on camera."

Jiro nods slowly to himself, as he begins transmitting graphics of the robot to the ship's computer as part of his report. "A conventional mining robot," he says at last. "Oi, when you're ready, see if there's anything intact in its brain-case?" He turns to Archer and Leandra, and smiles. "I think we'll be okay for now."

Leandra tilts her head, looking down at the robot. "We'll need to take it back. I'm sure it can find use in Coulam, with a little modification. Still, it's a pity to see something happen like this. I wonder what made it attack?"

Oi manages to get control of the wayward cameras. He's able to detect that another entity on the local network is trying to issue command overrides to their control protocol... in other words, someone else is trying to hack into them.

"With luck, Oi can tell us," replies Jiro softly.

"Ohhh ho ho my friends... looks like we've got ourselves some company. Another hacker. Someone else trying to hack into the station's network. We are definitely not alone." Oi chuckles, "Wonder if he's better than me... looks like we'll find out. Should I trace him back to the source, or dump him?"

"If you can find out where he's coming from, do so," says Jiro. "In the meantime, Archer, Leandra and I will fall back to the control booth. Let's go, folks."

Leandra snorts in derision. "Breaking into systems," she mutters. She'll keep close to Jiro, since he's the man with the really big gun. No sense getting hurt by some broken mining robot. "We can take it back, can't we?" she asks quietly.

Archer glances down, puzzled.

Jiro shrugs. "We can take it back once we're confident we aren't in danger, yes. Until then, let's leave it where it is."

Oi continues to hammer on the local security system. There's nothing moving besides the team on any of the outside or building monitors. The mineshaft is about ten meters in diameter and has an elevator with a three meter cab. There's steel decking placed every 20 meters and it goes down 200 meters - so about ten levels. The bottom three cameras aren't responding at all, and that's about the same place the sensors on the steam line terminate.

"Of course we can take it back. Already locked 'im out of the cameras, so hopefully whoever he is, eyes aren't on you right now." Oi frowns, as he starts trying to track down this worthy opponent. "Although if I had to hazard a guess, I'd say it'd right there where the steam line terminates. Odds are he's powering his stuff through that superconductor. Just so you know. Going to try and see if I can't get a better idea of what we're up against."

Archer interrupts and waves Jiro over to where he's standing. "Did you have a chance to look at this pipe before you had your little firefight?" He points to the steam pipes. The superconductor almost looks organic, as if it's a lichen growing on the pipe.

Jiro nods. "Is it possible to leave a message in the system?" he asks. "Something whoever it is couldn't possibly miss?"

Jiro shakes his head, and inspects the pipe more closely, as directed.

"Sure thing Jiro. What do you want me to tell 'im?" Oi sounds pleased with himself, "Not that he'll be able to do anything on the network now."

"A fractal pattern," says Leandra, as she leans in to inspect the conductor. "I wonder who we are dealing with. This was assembled with nanites." She asks Oi, "Does the system have any information about the hacker, by chance?"

"I'll see what I can dig up." Oi mumbles something about code, at least that's probably what it is he's mumbling about, and goes to dig for information on the hacker.

"Before you do that, Oi. Leandra, Oi, in your professional opinions.." Jiro considers, then proceeds. "What are the chances of a viable life-support zone within this complex, that is not receiving vital power from this superconductor?"

Archer nods. "That's it. I knew I'd seen that somewhere before. I thought we'd imported all of this stuff, though. I didn't think Ayer had any nanites to build the stuff."

"We don't," says Leandra to Archer. "This is beyond anyone on Ayer, as far as I know." Which, given the way she speaks, is very far indeed. "It comes from somewhere else, it would seem." She lets that thought tangle in the minds of the others for a while before saying, "It seems that we might have a visitor from somewhere mode advanced."

Archer says, "But if so, why use an obsolete mining robot for defense? This may be something home-grown."

Jiro nods. "Oi, before you do anything else," he says, "leave a message for your friend. We're cutting the superconductor in one hour, and we want to talk. Leandra, I want you to get to work on the radio rigs. If there's no physical tap, he's broadcasting, and that broadcast has to come from somewhere. See if you can find such a thing, and get some transmission-profiling software on whatever you find."

Jiro nods. "Alright, come on, let's get back to the booth with Oi. Archer, you have some geology training - I want you to get on the computer, or what of it Oi has working, and see what you can tell me about probable conditions down the shaft."

Leandra nods to Jiro. "I'll get to work right away. I suppose I can rig up some triangulation device to narrow down the position." She speaks to Oi, then, "So, what kind of sensors do you have at your fingertips?"

Oi Vey leaves a message of sorts for the intruder by attaching a custom error message to the security packets he's using to keep the sensors locked down. He can only assume that it's been received, because the mysterious hacker makes hundreds of attempts to crack the network over the next few minutes... all failures.

"Well he's got the message. Now that he knows we own the network, we can see if he'll be a little more forthcoming. I'll let you know what else I can find out. As for sensors, I believe they're internal cameras, Leandra." Oi grins. "Nice ones at that."

Leandra borrows some of Oi's internal sensors to try and trace the source of the rogue signals. She pulls out her own sensor probes and places them at various points around the blockhouse... it takes several minutes, but she is able to draw an inexorable conclusion: the superconducting cable is also being used as a carrier for radio transmissions, and it's radiating energy at a hundred points.

Archer, meanwhile, has collected the data from the remaining mining computers, the geothermal power system, and a hundred years of sattelite surveys, and has drawn a rough map of the carvern system below - less of a limestone cavern and more of a geological flaw left by a magma pocket. Some areas where bored out and are large enough for habitation, especially where the steam lines end and interface with pumping machinery over the magma beds. It will likely be a hot environment with a sulforous atmosphere; tolerable, but not optimal, for human life.

"The cable is an antenna," says Leandra. "If we cut it, our friend may decide it's worth coming to talk to us." She turns to Jiro, "As much as I dislike robbing something of its purpose, I fear we may have to damage the cable. It's a pity, it is such lovely craft."

Jiro shrugs a bit. "Sometimes, purposes are at odds with each other, Leandra. In such cases, which one should prevail?"

Leandra nods to Jiro, "We must do what the mission requires. There are few things that are easy to do, and fewer still easy things that worth doing."

Archer says, "It may be easy enough to repair, in any event."

Archer says, "It was grown in situ, so it can be regrown given time."

"Huh. This guy is..." Oi pauses, "Really really random. Trying a lot of different things. You know, when we were analyzing the wreckage of the programming cores, there were these very same patterns. Either this guy's a rank amateur or... he's a freakin' insane hacker. Maybe both."

Archer blinks at that statement. "Or... could it be an actual AI?"

Oi says, "Even automated hack-programs directed by someone have some kind of direction to them. Not quite like this though. Odd."

Jiro smiles quietly. "An AI? Why not just propose ghosts and be done with it?"

Oi replies, "Or aliens. But what would an AI need with life support? I mean that's a bit like asking what would your deity want with a starship... isn't it?"

Archer murmurs, "Depends on the deity, I suppose... I could see Zeus needing one." He shrugs. "I know, it sounds insane, but the only other choices are an extraplanetary infiltrator, a mining engineer surviving for over a century alone out here, or a secret cabal trying to use the station for their own nefarious purposes..."

"Fascinating though. It could be some kind of AI. Probably doesn't even realize what it's doing. At least it seems to recognize that we're going to threaten its operation. Hang on, let me try and see if I can make... first contact." Oi grins, "I've been waiting to use that line since we landed. Sorry. Seriously though... what would you think? Try and find the source of its programs and see if I can determine if it actually IS an AI we're dealing with here?"

"Oi, can you find out anything about the way this friend of ours communicates? If you can get any text I might be able to do an analysis to see where this hacker is from by studying their use of language." Leandra is getting more than a little curious now, it seems.

"I could try, Leandra. Not too terribly certain if it's going to use any language you'd be familiar with... but I suppose I can give it a shot." Oi furrows his brow as he notes the continued attempts at trying to access the blocked network. "Here goes nothing..."

Jiro picks up a toolkit from the transport aircraft and goes back into the cavern. Glancing around to be sure that he's not going to get attacked, he removes the CPU module from the mining robot that attacked him. It's a curious item, a slab of circuitry the size and shape of a book, with radiator fins and markings covering its sides.

Jiro puts the slab down carefully, reaching for his rocket carbine and backing away as he does. "Possible presences in the cavern, be alert," he reports via radio.

Meanwhile, Leandra runs the data from Oi's security program through some linguistic analysis... and comes up with a startling response. Out of millons of attack programs, one lonely packet appears to contain a reply, in the clear, in English. It says simply - 'GET ME OUT'.

"What in the world... Oi, I found something," she says. "There's a message in here, in plain English. 'Get me out' is all it says, though. This is extremely bizarre." Leandra furrows her brow and frowns. "We are going to have to find the source and see what is going on."

Oi grins wickedly, "All right. Sounds like we're going to have to make a trek down to the server room. Button up everyone..."
