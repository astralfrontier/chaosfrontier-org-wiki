After the short, brutal battle with the deranged mining robot, Team Aurora has gathered in the control booth of the Icereach blockhouse. A bewildering variety of data flows over the display screens on the consoles and walls, including geological surveys, security sensor logs, and Jiro's gun camera footage.

On the central display, Leandra's linguistic analysis shows a single phrase, recovered in cleartext from one of the millions of message packets pouring into the Icereach computers - 'GET ME OUT'. It sits bright and still amidst the confusion of telemetry, as if to mark its significance with silence.

Jiro hmms. "Alright. We need to figure out our next step," he announces. "This 'get me out' message - do we have a solid fix on where our friend is yet?"

Archer says, "That's just strange. 'Get me out'? Who? Out of what?"

"I imagine 'es holed up down in the drill shaft, just past where all the sensors are blacked out. Whatever it is, person or construct... I'll betcha that's where we track them down." Oi shrugs, "I could be wrong. Let's see if we can't get this guy to stop attacking the network so I can have a minute's peace. Maybe I can get more for ya."

Jiro nods. "Leandra, Oi, between the two of you, I want you to try and establish a dialogue with this guy. AI, ghost, or whatever else, he can still talk. Archer, see what you can do about seismic monitoring. If we have to go down there, I don't want to be buried too."

Archer nods. "There aren't a lot of sensors for it, but I'll see what I can dig up. There ought to be shaft monitors, that might give some indication of strain..." He turns back to the data feeds, seeing what instrument telemetry he can coax out of the system.

"Yeah sure. No problem. Just talk to an insane ghost, computer, or person." Oi cracks a grin, "Ought to be more personable than..." he stops, chuckles, "Well that's another story, eh? So come on Leandra, let's see what we can find out about this guy." With that Oi begins composing a message in the same cleartext that the 'GET ME OUT' message is from. He asks Leandra, "So... what should we say? Hallo, we're Team Aurora and we're here to rescue you?"

At that moment, a buzzer sounds in Jiro's earpiece... and then in everyone else's. The displays in your suit visors indicate that you have incoming calls from MacArthur, head of the Space Agency of Ayer.

A low-resolution image of MacArthur pops up in the corner of everyone's HUD. "Ah... I'm glad I got ahold of you. It seems you've found something interesting...

"We've filed the data on what we have. We're not ready to make a complete report yet," answers Jiro.

"We've found a high-tech piece of string," replies Oi, "More than that we can't say really."

A voice pops in over MacArthur, followed by another video. "Piece of string? More like a bloody tripwire! What are we discussing this for?" It's Anders, the man from the Terraforming Bureau. He looks flustered.

MacArthur sighs. "Calm down. We don't know anything yet. This isn't a time to over-react."

Leandra frowns in thought and says to Oi, "We shouldn't make any promises just yet. We aren't rigged up for a massive excavation." For her part, she pays little attention to the men appearing on her HUD, focusing on the task. "Let's try something more simplistic. Ask who it is, then we go from there."

Anders isn't mollified at all. "Over-react? If that's the same thing that came out of the blue a hundred years ago, there's no such thing as 'over-react'! We spent damn near a century re-programming every machine on the planet after that! You can't have forgotten! It's the damned virus come back to haunt us!"

"Mr. Anders, Mr. MacArthur, our report will be filed when we have one to file," promises Jiro, smiling for the effect it'll have on his voice. "We're in the middle of making contact with something at the moment. You can standby, or wait for our report, as you wish."

Archer says, "Works for me. If we don't get an answer, though.... is it trapped or fooling? I would advise, though, that you close down any data links you have to us here, just in case. A computer virus can't piggyback on -us-, and we can walk out if we have to."

Oi bites his tongue. He does have a little twitch to his eye as Anders decides to doubt his abilities. He instead replies to Leandra, "Alright then. We'll say... hello. Can you understand this message?"

MacArthur turns, apparently towards the camera linking him to Anders. "Look, just let the man do his job, alright? Let my people get to work."

"Sounds like a plan," says Leandra. She adds softly, "It's a miracle you guys can get anything done in this racket." She makes a mental note to request Oi cause an unfortunate delay in their transmissions on the next mission.

Anders frowns. "The others have been notified. They're being briefed now. They're going to want answers. You have an hour before they call. If it were up to me we'd dynamite the whole place and be done with it."

"Then the essence of progress is glad it is not up to you," Leandra murmurs softly.

"The faster we can proceed with our plan here, gentlemen, the faster our report will be ready," observes Jiro, diplomatically. "We'll be ready for a call in one hour." He unobtrusively sets a mark on his chronometer, and starts the countdown.

Anders signs off, and MacArthur closes his video to everyone except Jiro. His words are still audible. "They're waking everyone up for this, Captain. The Mayor of Domwun, the Councillors at Coulam, even your boss, Colonel Takeda. I'm sure the bloody press corps will be banging on my door inside of five minutes because nobody here can keep a lid on a rumor."

"We'll try to make it worth their while, sir," says Jiro, quietly.

MacArthur nods, and disappears.

Archer says, "Hmmm. Strain gauges aren't available... temp sensors are still running, though. between 35 and 40 C at the base of the machinery pit. A bit sweaty, but livable if we don't have to wear heavy clothing."

Leandra and Oi work at the consoles for a few moments, leaving more messages in public packets. After a half a minute there's a reply - 'I DON'T KNOW IT HURTS GET ME OUT'

"That wasn't very useful," murmurs Leandra. "Try to ask what hurts and where we are supposed to get the voice out of. I suppose if it doesn't know what it is, though, that this might be a hopeless errand. We'll have to go in. I'd like to take a look at that shaft and see what condition it is in first, though."

Jiro 'saddles up', prepping his weapon and checking his armor's condition out briefly. "Leandra, I want you to stay here with the others, and I'll go ahead," he says, firmly. "I'll take whatever sensors you need along. I trust you to come along when you are confident it's safe to do so."

"Bleeding..." Oi mutters a stream of expletives that begins in English and runs the gamut of languages, ending up with something not terribly nice in Chinese. This segues into "...doesn't even know if it understands what I'm saying. Alright... trying a different tactic." He will compose the message 'WHAT HURTS. And stop shouting. What are you? How do we get you out?' Oi then submits it to Leandra for approval. "What d'ya think? Even some..." Here an interesting Russian word is uttered, "could understand it, don't you think?"

"We cannot be sure it understands a thing we're saying," murmurs Leandra. "Try to use different languages, Oi. I don't know what other language it would prefer, but perhaps something will get a response, or at least produce a change."

Oi codes a security program to continually send messages to the intruder in a variety of languages, including questions about 'What Hurts', 'What Are You' and 'How do we get you out'. The system monitors flare and flow for a few minutes as the network traffic collides against Oi's firewalls.

Jiro hums to himself, watching Oi's displays as he preps the geosensor. "Consider that the remote system has no choice but to attack?" he suggests. "I'm not the expert, but there may be automated attacks that our target can't do anything to prevent."

A few replies trickle in, unmatched to any particular message. 'Unknown.' 'Halunen.' 'Buried...' 'Bound...' A few less-meaningful packets... a few with messages only a few characters long. 'GH'. 'TAC'. 'SG'.

"Whatever it is, it is damaged," says Leandra. "It may be a danger to itself and others. Isolation can cause madness. Perhaps our blocking the system is making matters worse, as well."

Leandra's geoscanner hums to life, its ultrasound window appearing in Jiro's helmet projector.

Archer says, "Halunen, eh? Interesting. I wonder..."

Jiro slinks down the catwalk to the floor of the blockhouse, treading light as a cat, and stalks off towards the drill shaft.

The drill shaft is about ten meters across, and slopes down into the earth at a sharp angle, of perhaps sixty degrees. It goes east, deeper under the mountain range. The irregular angles suggest that this was once a natural fissure that was enlarged. Steel deck gratings provide a floor of sorts, over the shaft. Floodlamps are set into the walls, but these seem to have failed; the pale, dim emergency lighting illuminates the shaft in twilight. Futher below, through the grating, other decks and landings can be seen - another floor maybe ten meters down, and beyond that, the features become indistinct. A furnicular elevator track is built into the west wall of the shaft, and a platform about three meters across stands at the top of the track. A fat bundle of steam lines crosses the decking and angles down the shaft, into the darkness below. The smooth, glassy walls suggest that the machinery that dug this shaft used extreme heat, and the odd material sets up spooky echos with every footstep.

"Huh. You know..." replies Oi, coming on over the communications link, "It seems to me that this... GH is probably Galil Halunen. Anyone have an idea what TAC or SG might stand for?"

Jiro descends carefully, consulting the telemetry on his HUD. "Can you feed me the probable location of that rockslide?" he asks via his radio link.

The geosensor sketches a scan of the shaft on both Leandra's monitor and Jiro's visor. The tunnel slopes steeply down into the earth for almost 200 meters. As the elevator quietly whirrs down its track, more detail is filled in - but the bottom is still a jumble of echoes.

The message packets continue to come in, but seem to be repeats, including the oddly-marked message 'SG', which the computer claims is in German.

Archer watches the data and shaft map over Leandra's shoulder. "TAC... hmm. Sounds familiar, somehow. No idea what SG might be."

"Huh. And this SG thingummy is in German. I can't for the life of me think of what that could translate to here..." Oi shakes his head as he stares at the computer screen, wracking his brain for an answer. "What do you think of it Leandra?"

"I'm not certain," says Leandra. "I am not a student of other languages," she explains. "I highly doubt it could really be the lost worker, though."

It takes several minutes for Jiro's platform to descend... four levels, five... the dim emergency lighting casts odd shadows as he passes. The bulk of the steam lines hangs on the wall of the shaft opposite him, and the ribbon of superconductive material has spread into a web - a mesh of wires criss-crossing the surface of the pipes, branching out onto the cieling.

Suddenly, the storm of intrusion packets ceases. The system monitors fall back to the idle point.

Jiro takes the time to look up and around, letting his helmet camera transmit a visual of what he sees. Sometimes he switches over to thermographic vision and does an all-around sweep.

Archer blinks. "What just happened? Did one get through, or did whatever it was give up?"

Jiro's sensors indicate the obvious... it's getting warmer. The still, dry air is approaching 35 degrees as the transport platform passes the seventh deck, 140 meters down.

The elevator platform has stopped at the end of its track, on the last intact platform in the mineshaft. It is far warmer here than it was outside, or even at the top of the shaft, and the still, stale air tastes ancient and musty even through the respirator filter. Through the steel grillwork of the deck, a few emergency lighting panels flicker pitifully, illuminating a tangle of fallen rocks, twisted pipes, and other debris. The smooth, glassy walls are etched and scored here, and the decking itself is covered in dust and soot. The heap of rubble seems to cover another portal, a tunnel leading from the bottom of the shaft into what could only be the mines themselves. Some parts of the rock walls are oddly striated, as a hole cut through through several folded layers of cloth.

"Whatever it is, it's retreated," informs Oi. "Probably sensed your presence Jiro. I'll try to let it know we're coming in peace."

Oi transmits messages of greeting and friendship, uncertain if they're being heard. The anomolous network of wires doesn't show up on a sweep of the network, and so it's hard to tell who, if anyone, is listening.

Meanwhile, at the bottom of the shaft, Jiro crouches on the elevator platform, using his vision enhancers to follow the track of the wires. A composite of the collapsed area slowly forms.

The mysterious mesh clings tightly to the metallic steam pipes, all the way down to the rock fall, and then both disappear into the heap of rubble.

Jiro frowns. "I'm going to try and dislodge some of this," he reports to his team. "I've got my sonic sensor running. Come if you are able."

The geological sensor on Jiro's harness beeps... it's detecting some seismic activity.

Jiro hmmms. "Looks like I spoke too soon," he calls up, wryly, and begins looking around, trying to trace the source.

Archer frowns at the readouts. "That is just way too coincidental. I'd retreat if I were you, Jiro...."

The signal is weak... compared to an earthquake or tembler, it's mild, hardly more than someone walking heavily. In the silence left after the elevator platform stops, the amplified reading sounds loud, almost rhytmic.

Oi makes a thoughtful sounding, "Hmmm. You alright Jiro? Any sign of what it is?"

"Just a moment," calls the priest, consulting his heads-up display for a moment. "I don't think it's a quake or a slide..." He spends a few moments quickly manipulating data into a graph.

Archer looks at the patterns developing from Jiro's transmission. "Something's burrowing, Jiro. Not sure of the direction, yet. Keep alert."

Following a short analysis, Jiro comes to the same conclusion everyone else does, and files his graph away. "Unless it's above me," is his conclusion, "I'm going to keep trying to remove rubble. Oi, it'd be nice if we had another mining robot on tap, but I don't expect miracles."

As he lifts rocks, a thought occurs to Jiro. "The attacker may have abandoned electronic attacks for a physical assault on the blockhouse," he says, evenly. "I want you three to do everything you can to verify your safety."

Archer says, "Understood. I'll check the VTOL. Did anyone take a close look at that machine shop we saw?"

"Jiro, maybe I should come to your location? There's nothing of use for me to do here at the moment," says Leandra. She isn't sure exactly what she's supposed to do to verify her safety at this point, anyway.

"Go ahead, Leandra," the man replies, as he continues lifting and grunting. "I'll feel a lot safer when you can figure out what's doing that digging."

In the still air and heat, Jiro sweats profusely. His soft armor fatigues chafe where they've become damp.

Oi takes a deep breath. He heads off to the Machine shop and finds one of the same sort of mining robot as before. "Hey guys... yeah give me ten minutes and I'll see what I can put together for you." Oi hauls the parts he needs together, and proceeds to put the robot back together.

Leandra pushes the elevator button. The machine whirrs softly up the shaft, leaving Jiro at the bottom of the deep well.

"Geez. This is such a lousy manual. The tools are nice though." Oi sighs, takes his time as he sorts through the manual and through the actual machine. "Well..."

Leandra will work with Jiro. She pauses at least to take off any excess clothing she can. She doesn't like extreme temperatures much. She would remove her armor, too, but Jiro probably would throw a fit. "I wonder what exactly we're doing down here, anyway," she murmurs softly.

Jiro grunts in response, but continues working as he finally musters breath to speak. "We are trying to find out just why this mesh disappears into this rubble, and what's really under there.."

Finally, Oi sorts through the badly-written repair manual, and the mining drone lurches to life near the top of the shaft. Everyone's visors now shows an icon indicating that the robot is responding to their commands and IFF transponders.

Meanwhile, Archer is working on the VTOL in case a hasty exit is necessary. Team Aurora has spent several hours investigating Icereach, and the late spring sun is sitting low on the horizon.

Archer checks out the shuttle, and finds no problems at all. Whatever the burrower is, it's staying deep, apparently. His HUD chimes with a warning as he finishes the check. _20 minutes to teleconference._ The list of addresses looks like a who's who of the polity leaders of Ayer. _Oh, great. We're **busy**, you self-important baboons. Stop joggling our elbows._

Oi marches the robot onto the elevator platform and sends it down to Jiro and Leandra, who continue to clear debris with hand-tools, and with hands... the rhythmic thumping of the digging machine on the other side is quite audible now.

Jiro gets an update, and slumps down at last, breathing hard. "Leandra... when the elevator comes, let's head back up on it," he suggests.

Leandra nods to Jiro and steps away from the rock. She sighs and wipes sweat from her brow. Before she gets on the elevator, she'll doublecheck her sensors and gear. No point in leaving anything down here.

The thumping and grinding on the far side of the wall continues for a minute while Leandra and Jiro rest... and then stops. The only sound that's audible is the whirr of the elevator platform, still sixty meters above you.

Jiro waves his companion back away from the elevator, then prepares his rocket carbine. "Let's make sure Oi's new toy is friendly, too," he says, conversationally.

Archer clicks on the mike override. "Jiro, Leandra - get out of there, right now! Climb if you can. Oi, get outside -NOW-."

"Archer, the lift is a few seconds away," replies Jiro, sounding tense. "What's the problem?"

Archer says, "I ... don't know. It involves a lot of heat. The burrower may be directly connected to the steam lines or even the magma chamber. Don't start the mining robot until you're out of there."

"Roger that," calls Jiro, waving Leandra toward the emergency ladder. "We're ascending now. Leandra, I'll follow you."

Leandra and Jiro hurridly climb the ladder to the final landing, passing the elevator as it delivers the mining drone. As it reaches the bottom of the shaft, the mechanical noises from behind the rockfall start up again, but it sounds different this time - as if something is piling rock back against the wall, instead of removing it.

Jiro takes time to listen to this, and as he crests the landing, he passes word upward. "We weren't being opposed directly," he concludes via radio. "There's something there keeping the tunnel mouth blocked, deliberately."

Archer says, "This may be a good thing."

The platform returns as Jiro and Leandra reach the eighth landing. The mining drone is crouched, idle, in the dimness below.

"Oi, see if you can get back in touch with our friend. Ask him, in as plain language as possible, if he controls the network attacks or the robots," suggests Jiro.

"Roger," Oi says, and turns to his portable console. While he's been working on the robot, a stream of messages have come in, all saying the same thing - 'TOPSIDE NOW! TOPSIDE NOW!'

Oi frowns. "Uh... guys... it's saying something about 'Topside Now'. I don't like the looks of this."

Archer chuckles over the intercom. "I already told them that."

Leandra doesn't wait. "Come on," she says flatly. Somehow this doesn't stress her out. Maybe Coulam really do have a good portion of their humanity extracted at birth. She rushes up the ladder as fast as possible. Something bad is about to happen, and she'd rather it happen far from her.

Shrugging, Jiro follows, ascending the ladder. While it's possible that this way is slower, it's also very possible that something or someone could interfere with the lift. He reflects on this as he follows, trying to fit the pieces of this puzzle into a coherent whole.

Jiro and Leandra continue to climb the emergency ladder, leaving the slow elevator platform far behind them. A few moments later, a warning indicator flashes on the mining drone's icon in the display - it announces that it has a leak in its chemical laser, because its sensors are detecting the harsh organic fuel in the air around it...

Oi nervously states, "I don't think that's coming from our robbie... there's no drop in pressure in the laser mechanism... I think it's coming from another drone... Uh, that laser dye is highly volatile, even... explosive! Shit!"

"Oi, have our drone aim its laser at rock and ram itself against the wall," instructs Jiro crisply. "If it's still mobile.."

Archer says, "You figuring on disabling it before it can fire into the murk?"

Jiro continues climbing, behind Leandra, and between breaths manages to speak. "Leandra.. it seems like there's more than one mind in operation here... When we get up here, will you review our logs and see if you can deduce something of use?"

The robot obediently gets up from its crouch and rams its proboscis-like laser into the rock wall with a crunch. The wire-frame outline on its diagnostic display looks comically like an ostrich with its head jammed in the sand...

"I can try," says Leandra over her shoulder. She's rather busy rushing up and out of the area at the moment. The evaluation will have to wait for now.

As Jiro and Leandra crest the lip of the drill shaft, there's a muffled bang below, followed by a tremendous roar. The ground shakes in the blockhouse and its attached cavern, but the majority of the pyrotechnics seem to be contained in the shaft. The flash is bright and momentary, and then silence reigns again.

Remarkably, the icon for your mining drone is still glowing in your HUDs, although its warning about a leaking laser has changed to a warning about an unconfirmed percussive event in its part of the mines, just a few seconds ago. This last is accompanied by a message in bright colors that all human personnel, advising that evacuation would be prudent.

On the upside, the tunnel seems to be open. The drone's cameras show an even channel blasted through it, nearly a meter and a half wide. The smoke wafts in the bottom of the shaft, and the thermal sensors show an open space beyond.

"So much for a success," murmurs Leandra. "We'll be lucky if the entire project isn't cancelled after this. Does anything think that chopping this wire is a bad idea at this point?" She frowns. "Oi, did you say that thing was saying tac? As in TAC? The same ones who put together the plans for the first gate?"

Archer says, "I knew I'd heard that acronym somewhere..."

The mining drone sits in the mouth of the tunnel, requesting instructions, and asking for assistance in evacuating injured personnel.

Jiro queries the drone for clarification in its odd request. The machine is highlights a roughly humanoid outline in its sensor display, and a pageful of programming code scrolls by, indicating that the drone is to assist in mine rescues. Apparently it's complaining that it can't move the figure on its own.

Deciding that this merits immediate personal attention, Jiro directs Leandra to keep ascending. "I'll meet you topside," he says shortly, then grabs hold of the ladder's runners with his hands and braces his feet likewise. Slowly, then faster, he descends, using the quickest way down he knows. He slows himself via friction near the bottom, and heavy booted feet strike the surface. He rises from his crouch, scanning quickly and visually for what the mining robot saw.

Without even emergency lighting, seeing anything is nearly impossible. The composite image generated by the computerized sensors makes the entire cavern look even more surreal and otherwordly. Some walls are smooth and worked; others are coarse and blocky. Everywhere, odd striations in the walls indicate that something seems to have warped the very fabric of the earth. It is quite hot down here, almost 40C, and the heat makes the dimness seem even more opressive. Nothing moves in the hot, dark air. Near the tunnel connecting with the drill shaft, rubble litters the floor. The remains of some of the steam lines emerge from the rubble and snake along the floor into the darkness. Against the far wall, a surprisingly small bank of pumping machinery rests, and it is here that the steam lines finally end, just a few dozen meters from the magma beds.

An odd shape is stretched out across the floor of the mines, roughly humanoid in outline, but covered in metallic plating. The plating is festooned with protrusions, like antennas, sensors, or radiators, some as long as a few inches, others so short as be barely visible. The shape is about three meters long. The metallic shell seems to merge with some tracings on the floor - which in turn spread from the man-shaped oddity and merge with the spidery metallic shell covering the steam lines. Whatever this strange thing is, it's connected with the superconducting antenna that was first visible nearly a quarter of a kilometer above.

The first thing Jiro does is approach, and attempt to find a fragment of the thing already separated from it. Barring that, he's willing to knock off a bit of protrusion. The geosensor is connected to his armor's network, and from there, Leandra or Archer should be able to run an analysis of whatever the thing is composed of.

One of the smaller vanes snaps off easily in Jiro's hands. It looks metallic, but supple.

"That must be the source of the voice. Let's grab it and get out of here before something else happens," says Leandra. "I'm waiting up top with scanners, but I figure we should get a bit further away. How long until that fool conference?"

Jiro intructs the mining drone to take hold of one side of the strange figure, and he himself lifts the other. There's a lot of small tearing and pinging noises as wires and vanes snap free, leaving a human-shaped gap in the mesh, rather like a child's snow-angel. Together, Jiro and the drone manhandle the figure onto the elevator platform.

After a few minutes, the elevator platform reaches the top of the drill shaft again, where Oi and Leandra wait.

"Judging from the nature of the communications, we are dealing with at least two personalities or sources," says Leandra. "I am unsure which is which, but clearly our 'get me out' messenger was under stress. Perhaps this finding will clear things up. The rest is from a broken mind, ramblings and ravings. There's not much to go on."

Jiro crouches on the elevator as it ascends, listening to the report at last. "Alright," he says finally. "Good work. We're going to evacuate the block-house for now, so wrap it up."

Team Aurora is un-harrased during the evacuation. The mining drone and Jiro half-carry and half-drag the heavy metal figure out of the blockhouse and into the unused warehouse/hanger, where Leandra sets up a shelter and her medical gear and begins a thorough analysis of the man-shaped thing.

Meanwhile, Archer and Oi seal the blockhouse, removing auxiliary power cells, shutting down lights, and bolting the airlock doors. Oi runs a fiber-optic cable back to the hangar with the VTOL, and sits quietly in front of a portable terminal, monitoring the remaining systems for activity.

At last, the time scheduled for the 'conference' rolls around. Jiro and Archer are seated in the VTOL cabin, in front of a large display screen. The computer chirps and opens into half a dozen windows, including MacArthur and Anders; a man in a uniform similar to Jiro's; another man with strange facial features, clearly of Coulam; and two more Australites.

After a moment of shuffling papers and digital tablets, MacArthur clears his throat. "Umm... so. You've... found something. Or something, we see?"

Jiro, for all that he's been through, is composed and calm. "Ladies and gentlemen, my report for the moment is incomplete, pending an investigation by our associate Leandra, from Coulam. Our systems expert is keeping tabs on the station computers. We touched down..." And for three minutes, Jiro briefly outlines the entrance to Icereach, eliding unuseful detail. Another four minutes suffices to describe the Socolite wire and its pathway down the shaft, along with what they found at the bottom. "Psychological analysis suggests we have possession of one of two entities. Leandra is examining what we brought back. The nature of the other is unclear at this time."
