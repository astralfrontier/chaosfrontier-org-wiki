Team Aurora has had a wild ride - a milk run to Icereach has turned into the media event of the year, with the possible discovery of the rampant AI and the recovery of the survivor from the Crash. In the days following their return to Domwun, the launch timetable is accelerated - a flight originally slated for six months in the future, is now planned to begin in two weeks.

Everyone spends time comparing notes and making plans. The eventual consensus is that the first week will be spent in Domwun, collecting information from the library, to cram as much training as possible into the narrow time window; and the next week at the Exile Spaceport, for the transfer to orbit.

In an age of instant communications, the need for a physical university campus is questionable - but some traditions die hard. A few days after the press conference, Leandra, Oi, and Archer find themselves in the Domwun University Library shuffling data disks and copying data into archives for the flight.

Between mugs of strong black tea, a gift from Vedus Greyrobe of Coulam, the team is making an admirable show of cramming fourteen hours a day into scouring the library, collecting background on anthropology, criminology, and aritificial intelligence.

Leandra finds the library a welcome distraction. The shortage of real books is a bit disappointing, but she's become used to the ways they follow outside Coulam. She reflects for a moment that she should be grateful these people can still write. Her study time requires no caffeine, which she finds a curious drug, indeed. For her, learning is its own reward, and she proves quite able to handle the grind.

Archer is also making sure that they have a full load of the sciences, engineering both Ayer-current and obsolescent (in case they need to help bootstrap a world that reverted to barbarism after the Crash) and everything pertaining to history and anthropology that he can locate.

On the second day, just after two in the morning, the library is almost empty. The building is six stories tall, ringed with stacks of books around an open atrium. The atrium is filled with reading tables and cubicles containing holographic terminals. The lights are dim for the evening, and there are few sounds besides your own tapping on controls. Footsteps echo loudly in your ears.

Archer stretches and turns to look in the direction of the footsteps.

Archer frowns. _Now that's odd. We're in here on special passes - who else is authorized at this time of night?_ He stands up quietly and nudges Oi, pointing at the visitor and murmuring quietly, "Anyone you recognize?"

Oi stretches out lazily and turns his head towards the approachign footsteps. He looks, peering in the direction Archer's pointed. _Huh._

Leandra, for her part, is staying the course. She frowns in thought and tries to keep her mind on her studies. She does nothing more than spare a brief look for the curiousity of Oi and Archer.

There's an odd grin on Oi's face. He nods to Archer, and motions for him to not quite acknowledge the new arrival just yet. _So old Rudy's in town..._ Oi turns to his computer screen, and proceeds to divest his computer of any... creative coding. "'Ello Rudy. Come over and have a chat eh? Meet some of my pals."

A few moments later, the man on the upper floor starts, and peers over the railing, adjusting his thick goggles. A message pops up on Oi's holo - 'Jeezus, Oi Vey! I'll be right down!'

Archer chuckles. "I _thought_ that was the computing section. Ask him how he got in, will ya? I'm going to track down a reference." He goes back to his terminal and starts to hunt for Theophrastus Arthur Cohen, and Alpha Centauri Prime.

"Leandra," mutters Oi, after receiving his message, "You might find an interesting... case study in Rudy here. Archer... well... er, save your work and make sure you've got nothing important goin' on right now... might get a bit tetchy, these computers."

Archer says, "Hmmm?" He makes the backup as suggested. "Why?"

The figure disappears and emerges from an elevator on your floor a few minutes later. He walks over nervously tweaking his goggles. a stack of data disks in one hand and some kind of thermos in the other. "Well, well, well. Oi Vey. Last I heard, you'd gotten cursed with earning an honest living! What brings ye back here at oh-my-god-it's-early-two-hundred?"

"Oh... things, you know. Doing a bit of studying." Oi grins, "And how about you? Still up to the old tricks? Didja get a pass in here, or pull a bit of the old B&E like usual? What's in the thermos?"

Leandra raises an eyebrow and hmms. If it's one of Oi's friends, it's probably not the kind of person she wants to get familiar with. She'll at least be polite, though, and nod her head at the man.

Beazel frowns. "You make that sound so criminal, old son. And inelegant. I got in the old fashioned way, through the tunnels. You know, the airlocks that are welded shut?"

Beazel nods back, then with a total lack of subtlety, turns back to Oi and waggles his eyebrows, once.

"About as welded shut as ol Macy's... erm that is to say the ones that aren't all that welded shut at all." Oi has to laugh at Beazel, "Ahhh yes, yer homegrown brew, is it?"

Archer watches this byplay with a bit of amusement, as well as a bit of bemusement.

Beazel taps the end of his nose and speaks with exaggerated slowness. "So... if yer here at two in the morning... with two Solid Citizens scraping the screens like a couple of first-years at cram time... then these must be the people yer workin' with." He grins. "Either that, or yer wardens. But I'd lay better odds that I'm standin' in the presence of the famous Team Aurora One."

He takes a sip from the flask. "It's off the shelf, old son. Nothing exotic when I'm workin' these days."

Leandra blinks a few times at Oi and Beazel, then looks to Archer. She's not entirely sure what to make of the waggling eyebrows, but it's probably nothing good. The Coulam will try to get her mind back on the task at hand.

Oi chuckles, "Well at least you haven't totally fried your brain yet. What there is of it, that is." He smiles, "And if you laid odds, I'm afraid I'd have to take your money, but you might well be right." He then adds, "Is that 'nothing exotic' to you, or 'nothing exotic' with regards to the rest o' Ayer?"

Beazel grins. "It is my understanding, sirrah, that you can no longer ask me that question. But seriously - whatcha doing here this late?" A few dozen intrusion warnings pop up all over Oi's display, and Beazel looks genuinely impressed. "You're keepin' me out? Day-umm. Clean livin' must have done wonders for your skills."

Oi smiles innocently, "Who me? Nawww, I couldn't possibly be keeping you out. Don't suppose you've kept up on tracing algorithms these days..." There's a smirk on Oi's face as he ponders the image files he's sending ol' Beazel. "Seriously, I'm here studying. Workin at the computer, tryin' to figure out what makes them go crazy. What makes them go Rampant and all. Among other less... shall we say, purely academical studies."

Leandra frowns deeply and makes a sound of displeasure. "What are you doing?" she asks softly, her eyes narrowing. She imagines she knows what 'keeping me out' means, and it offends her. "I've always found it odd that people here are so eager to break things that exist to serve them," she says.

Oi turns to Leandra, "We don't break 'em. We're only testing them, making sure that the people running 'em are fit enough to be doing so. Helps keep things from breaking into violence in the streets over stupid things."

Oi says, "It's The Game, after all."

Archer says, "If you say so. Just don't try it on my flight computers, 'kay?"

Oi waves a hand dismissively, "There wasn't anything interesting in 'em anyway."

Leandra snorts, "Your Game is nothing more than an attempt to violate and do harm. Do you feel powerful, going into places where you are not welcome?" She sounds more than a bit testy.

Beazel shrugs. "I'll keep my fingers out of the things that people need to breathe. I'm crazy, but I'm not homicidal."

"And is breathing all that you care about?" asks Leandra. She sizes the man up for a moment. "I think I might be able to leave you flat on your face. Does that mean I should? After all, I wouldn't have to kill you."

Archer shrugs. "They're harmless enough, Leandra. And they do serve a useful purpose. We do have crazies, and folks like Oi and his friend are ... well, think of them as an inoculation against the really nasty ones."

Oi smiles at Leandra, "Our Game is what keeps we citizens of Domwun practiced and ready as what we do. It's not so much a feelign of power, but a feeling of knowing what you can do. Whereas you might leave someone flat on their face, still breathing, we just remove the power from them to begin with." Oi chuckles, "It's quite beautiful."

Beazel takes a step back, looking confused. "'Ere now. What are you getting so surly in my library for?" The way he emphasizes the 'my' sounds meaningful. "Miss, fergive me fer sayin' so, but I think yer not from around this town, are ya?"

"She's one of those Coulamites..." explains Oi.

Archer chuckles. "I don't recall seeing the name 'Beazel' on the board of directors..."

Beazel says, "Tell me somethin', Miss Coulam. You must know all about biodiversity."

Beazel continues, "And if yer hangin' around with ol' Oi Vey here, you must know something about memetics. Put the two together. What happens when you lose diversity in your meme pool?"

"Do not try to justify your acts with biology. By the same token one could justify killing as survival of the fittest," says Leandra. The Coulam frowns and adds, "I think criminals are of little benefit."

"Well it's not as though playing The Game makes you a criminal," states Oi, raising a brow at Leandra's words. "It's something everyone does."

Oi says, "It's not just a biological thing... it's a cultural aspect. Much the same way you Coulamites gengineer just about darn near everything to improve upon it and make it better, we do this, to improve ourselves and make us better. We're of the belief if you don't like it, change it, or if you can't change it, learn how to do so."

Beazel shakes his head, and waves his hand up at the stacks of discs on programming and AI. "Blokes like me an' Oi, wrote half of what's up there. Blokes what understand a different kind of intelligence. It takes one kind of mind to be able to achieve something within the rules. It takes something else entirely to achieve something in the edge cases, the don't-care conditions, the things nobody anticipated. You want to know what Domwun was, two hundred years ago? Domwun was the last reseve of the hacker memes on New Queensland. A world where they edged out the subsversive element, and edged out their ability to come up with new ideas."

Beazel asks something of Archer. "You, you're these ones spacer, yah? You can tell them, maneuverability and instability in your flier are the same thing. That's what we are." He turns back to Lea. "But we know one other thing... you don't wreck your playground."

Oi nods, "Just because you can, doesn't always mean you will."

Archer nods. "They are right, Leandra. It's not the way Coulam does things, but it is a viable, if somewhat rough-edged, solution to the problem of social experimentation." He grins at Beazel's analogy. "Indeed. I don't often run into ground-pounders who understand that."

"But you are criminals," says Leandra. "At least if I understand correctly. And if you have broken in, I think you should be arrested. By your own standards, you aren't a very good criminal to come out and let us know who you are and that you don't really belong."

"It was us what re-wrote the programs that run damn near every machine in this city, Mister... Collins? That's what the newslines are calling you. I've worked on a few aircraft. Those VTOLs everyone loves so much, they fly like bricks. Damn heavy bricks." Beazel stops for a moment and shudders. "That was a job. It's hard to have people's lives riding on your work."

"Leandra, you are taking things far too seriously..." Oi chuckles, "Who do you think opened up the old airlocks in the first place? Do you honestly believe that the entire faculty here doesn't know about the tunnels? I'd say the only ones what don't... are the first-years."

Archer nods. "And don't think I don't know it. Those things are _too_ unstable to fly without microsecond adjustments."

Oi says, "Some of them, anyway."

Beazel stares at Leandra, agape for a moment, and then breaks out in a barking kind of laugh. He produces his ID badge and tosses it on the table in front of Lea. "Oh, that's great, miss. I didn't say I don't belong here. I just said I broke in. I'm the night librarian." He finishes laughing and removes his goggles. "It's just more fun this way."

"You are all insane," says Leandra flatly. And she turns her attention back to her studies.

Archer grins at Leandra's discomfiture. "They're the yeast in the beer, Leandra. Crazy, but necessary."

Oi nods to Beazel. He decides not to mention the hydroponics experiments for now. "Well yeah..." he replies, "But you say that like it's a bad thing..."

Beazel thinks for a moment, then snaps his fingers. "Oi... you brought back that bloke Halunen, from Icereach, yes? You have samples of that code, the fragments in the cores, and so on?"

Leandra frowns deeply and makes a sound of disapproval. This, to her, is stepping well over the line.

Oi smiles, "What kinda Gamer do you take me for Beaz? Of course I've got samples of the code. And the fragments. Samples of the attack codes and everything. Why d'you ask?"

Archer grins and waggles his eyebrows back at the pair of Gamers before going back to his own studies. _I don't know how Coulam does it. They seem to stay viable, at the cutting edge of science, but individually they've got no drive to challenge authority. How do they **do** it?_

Beazel shrugs. "Well, the old Railroad Club has been working on analysis of rampancy in AI's. You gotta know the problems in that. If one got loose... well, we don't want to rewrite everything on the damn planet for the second time this century. But... we're kind of the clearinghouse on the fragmented code. Most of it's junk, like introns in genetics, hardly distinguishable from noise. But some analyses show a pattern."

Oi raises a brow, "Really? Huh. Well I haven't been keeping up as best as I should then... what sort of pattern?"

Beazel strokes his chin. "Well... it's like crypto, yes? The art of making information look as much like random noise as possible. But you can unlock it with the right key, and that implies, there's always a pattern somewhere." He taps at a terminal and a rotating diagram of curves, sine waves and other undulating surfaces appear. "But the more complex the crypto, the closer the signal is to just plain noise."

Beazel taps a few more keys. "Now, sometimes, you might take a sample of noise - take it from atmosphere, or cosmic radiation, or pulling chips out of a hat. And once in a while, if you find the right key, that noise might seem to contain a message."

The sine waves steady and shift, and turn into a series of concentric spheres.

Beazel steps back. "When you find that... have you found a real message, or just an artifact of the rules of your own eyeballs?"

Oi considers, "I'm not certain. All depends..."

"If you see the world upside down long enough it will eventually become rightside up in your mind," murmurs Leandra. She can't help but pay just a slight amount of attention to the miscreants.

"The incidence of intelligible signals in the scrambled cores of the atmosphere processors, the fusion plants, the stargate, they all show the barest shred of meaning, hardly measurable above nothing at all. But we think if we found the right key... well... it would be like finding out that xor'ing the first ten digits of pi against a random sample of noise and getting your phone number."

"How about ye come on down to my humble abode," Beazel suggest. "I've got a chunk of mainframe that's not connected to anything down there, an arena for dangerous code."

"You let me have a crack at that code sample," he says, "And I'll see what I can tell you about it. Who knows, it might come in handy for ya."

Oi nods, "Sounds like a plan then. We'll give it a shot, see what we can find..." Oi bows, amicably, "If you will excuse me. I have to go deal with this AI."

Oi looks at Beazel, "Oh no, I'm taking a look at it myself. You get to have all the fun."

Archer grins. "I'd tell you to make sure it can't broadcast, but then you'd probably make comments about your grandparents and how to consume eggs."

Beazel mocks a bow, hands spread. "By all means, old son." He straightens and asks, "Will your friends be joining us?"

"With men like this doing research against disaster," begins Leandra, leaving her thoughts unfinished, but clear: who needs disaster?

Beazel stares at Leandra, slack-jawed. "Who indeed, madame."

He regains his composure. "Alright, then. Walk this way, me bucko." He sets off towards the elevator.

Beazel's 'office' occupies a third of a sub-basement, and is a cluttered mess of folding tables, computer equipment, holographic displays, and other high-tech gadgets. Ironically, one corner is occupied by an impeccably tidy living area, with a spotless floor and sheets on the bed tight enough to bounce a quarter on. In the center of the room is a round, flat table four meters across - a big holographic projector of some kind. The same kind of curved shapes and surfaces he showed you on the terminal upstairs are projected on the display, only much larger and a hundred times more intricate.

Based on the sample of corrupted code provided by Oi, Beazel runs his analysis. It takes several minutes for the program to run; Beazel gets up several times to adjust odd pieces of gear. The image wavers and flickers while the analysis grinds on.

Finally, a window pops up with just three lines. TAC. GH. SG.

Beazel frowns. "This is a remarkably pure sample. The fragments we got out of the atmosphere processor were signed with dozens of different keys and identities - some of them belonged to people working there; some of them seemed random. What we're seeing here, is confirmation of your mates' theory - there were three things thinking down there. And only three."

He taps a few more keys. "Why in blazes is this 'SG' bloke tagged like it's in Old German?"

A moment later, the curving surfaces on the monitor flicker and degenerate into static. An alarm sounds quietly, and the projector shuts down. "Damn," Beazel states. "Well, that's it, I'm afraid. They all go south eventually. It's why we keep them on an isolated system." He holds out his hand. "Good to see you again, Oi. Good luck with your honest living. Me, I'll stay here and stick to the books. I hope you and yer mates get the gate running again. Fortune and glory to you all. Even the icy one."

"Alright. Thanks mate. We'll do our best. Keep an eye on this thing though," replies Oi, doing what he can to salvage the AI code. "Who knows what'll happen. Take care."

For his part, Jiro is attending seminars run by the secular armed forces of his nation. The Church's military arm does not generally participate in covert counter-terrorist activity, but as the combined factions of the planet would not have accepted a commando even after the team's stunning success, a cleric whose integrity is recognized and respected must be trained in some of the same skills. The experience is ruthless and brutal, and as a consequence it produces results.

The rest of the week passes quickly. By Friday, Oi, Leandra, and Archer have collected a small pile of holographic disks. The small size is deceptive; they store several terabytes of recorded data on subjects as diverse as criminal psychology, electronic security, and farming culture on the Prime Colony of Alpha Centauri.

Early on Saturday morning, the team gathers once again at the airfield for the transcontinental flight to the City of Exile, located on the far coast. Once again, the prevailing winds are twisted by the operation of the atmosphere processor east of the city. Archer keeps the VTOL flying at an altitude of about 10 kilometers, and the vast, empty territory below slides by at over 600 knots.

Several hours and several time zones later, it's late in the day in Exile territory.

The approach to the City of Exile overflies grasslands and deciduous forests. The largest of these plains is home to the atmosphere processor. Its conical, volcanic shape is particularly apt today, as the giant terraforming engine is running at full bore. Clouds of vapor reach skyward, dispersing quickly as the enormous fusion-powered compressors push millions of tons of air out of the top of the huge machine. As the VTOL approaches the eastern coast of the continent, the forests and grasslands give way to rolling hills covered in lush greenery, moistened by both the exhaust of the atmosphere processor and breezes from the ocean.

You pass over the city from the southwest, heading towards the airport in the north. Unlike Domwun and Coulam, Exile is not domed. The buildings, streets, and avenues rise high into the air, unhindered by the arcs of titanium and crystal that covered the other cities. The indicators in the aircraft and on personal displays is clear - the outside atmosphere is breathable, human normal, with an ordinary oxygen and nitrogen mix.

Lights glitter on the sides of the buildings in the gathering dusk. Most of the buildings are blocky, many appear to be mini-arcologies, covering an entire city block. Others, especially near the center of the city; are built as clusters of soaring towers, dozens of stories tall; or the shape of pyramids; some are in the shape of medievel Asian castles, with textured roofs that simulate the appearance of clay shingles.

The Exile airfield is north of the city, marked with virtual and real beacons of bright blue and green. Automated indicators guide the VTOL to a landing on a wide, paved pad. Two electric trams are waiting, crewed by a pair of soldiers each. They wear uniforms of a dark grey synthetic material with high-collared, heavy jackets and Pershing-style service hats, marked with red and silver piping and a simple, abstract marking on each shoulder. Each has a breather mask clipped to their belt.

The air here smells unusual - it has the salt tang of the sea, and the strong scent of trees and grasses. Even the addition of aviation exhaust adds to the fundamentally outdoor flavor of the air. It's unusual, on a world where practically everyone lives under domes, to breath air that hasn't been filtered through a machine.

Jiro meets the VTOL almost on the pad. He's wearing his own uniform, and is accompanied by two men of the Church's armed forces, similarly attired. "Welcome," he says simply, inclining his upper body in a respectful gesture. "We're honored to receive you here in our refuge." The traditional greeting breaks into informality, and the warrior-cleric shows a smile. "How was your flight?"

Archer mirrors the formal greeting, then gives a decidedly informal thumbs-up. "Can't complain. How was your week?"

Jiro gestures to his two companions, who bow respectfully. "Special services training," he explains. "And psychological analysis. It's going to be a busy month of transit."

Leandra, for her part, is thrilled to be here. She smiles and bows to Jiro politely. "It's good to see you." Her eyes weigh him carefully, "You've spent your time very well."

Oi smiles upon spotting his friend and shipmate. "Ahhh it was alright. Archer's getting better at flying the thing. I hardly even noticed the turbulence." He chuckles, "And your week?" He blinks, "Psychowhoozy?"

Jiro flexes a little, permitting himself another smile. "Free-fall isn't kind to the bones and muscles. And long-term confinement isn't kind to the mind. We all wanted me to be prepared for both."

Archer nods. "It does take a little getting used to. Bringing anything along to read?"

"Verrrry well," repeats Leandra, grinning widely. Well, maybe this mission isn't all bad, after all. And she isn't thinking about the Team Aurora business.

"Reading material? As much as my data-storage allowance permits," replies Jiro. "Apparently they're sending something else along, a special educational module or something, but we'll see." He clears his throat. "Shall we go?"

Archer says, "Lead on."

The escorts lead you to the trams - light electric vans, without the heavy suspension or airlocks found on vehicles near less-terraformed regions, like Domwun.

The streets leading through Exile are different from the cramped alleys of Domwun, or the natural flagstone footpaths of Coulam. Here, the streets are at least two lanes in each direction, and accomodate a fair volume of traffic. Broad slidewalks on either side carry foot traffic; many people carry breathers, but do not wear them. Most city blocks are covered by a single building. Many have one or more towers protruding from their top. Enclosed bridges connect the buildings to each other at the middle of the block, usually on the third story.

The city lacks the natural elements of Coulam, or the cramped rough-and-tumble neon-and-noise style of downtown Domwun. There are few advertisements, and no garish signs. The most colorful buildings are temples in a dozen different styles ranging from Pagoda-like towers to Gothic-style spires. Even so, other buildings, obviously not temples, also stand out. You pass several sunken amphitheaters, with domes retracted like mechanical seashells; here and there, the bottom floors of buildings open into brightly-lit markets.

The van approaches a tall steel-and-glass building near the center of the city. The marble sign proclaims that it is the Exile Council Offices, one of many administrative support agencies for the civil government of the city.

Noting his friends' observation, Jiro explains. "Simplicity is a difficult goal to reach. Achieving it is a crucial step, though not the ultimate goal."
