Near the end of Jiro's week of training, while the rest of the team is in Domwun, he is summoned to the office of Colonel Alix Takeda, the commander of the Armed Forces of the City of Exile. The office is high in the side of a steel-and-glass administrative building, with slightly sloped sides. Jiro rides the elevator up from street level and has time to collect his thoughts.

The time is late afternoon. Team Aurora is due to arrive a the airfield in about an hour. While the armed forces are small, a face-to-face meeting with the Colonel is rare. The elevator doors open onto wide hallway with a vaulted cieling and walls made of a substance that looks like polished marble. Even so, Jiro's footsteps are muffled as he walks to the double office doors at the far end of the hall. A simple plauqe on the outside bears Takeda's name, rank, and office.

Jiro knocks, and the doors swing open automatically. At the far end of the room, Takeda is standing before a broad bay window, looking out over the city, with a clear view of the ocean to the east. Dusk is gathering in the eastern sky as the sun sets in the west. The office, like the hall outside, is done the same dark, stone-like substance. Takeda turns as Jiro enters.

Takeda says, "Welcome, Captain. At ease. Have a seat, if you like. This isn't a matter of command or duty."

Jiro bows politely, then takes a seat as requested. The intermingling of military and religious tradition is a twisty path of expectation and culture at times, but Jiro's feet walk it readily. "Thank you, sir."

Takeda sits himself, and folds his hands on the large desk. "I read the log of your Interrogat, Captain. I wasn't present for it myself - but as you know, the identities of the Interrogators are not relevant to the discussion. Still, I was hoping I might ask you some similar questions myself."

Jiro opens his hands in a welcoming gesture. "Gaining confidence in the man you're about to send on this mission seems prudent, sir. I'm at your disposal."

Takeda taps a few illuminated pads on the surface of his desk. Under the surface, video displays activate and display a variety of reports - logistical records, maps of Ayer and the 55 Cancri system, and so on.

Takeda says, "The reason that the Exiles came to Ayer was similar to the reasons driving the Australites, but different in one important respect. The Australites felt that their culture was being edged out of acceptability on New Queensland. We've never had such a problem. However... our pursuit of Gnosis, by its nature, sometimes demands extremes of isolation."

Jiro nods slowly. "Oil and water, that's the metaphor I remember in school, sir. Dew on the lotus blossom is another - never separated, but never really together."

Takeda says, "Those are apt metaphors. However... well, to be direct about it, each of us is but one droplet of dew or oil. Remove us too far from the main body, and we might evaporate."

Jiro shifts just a bit in his seat. "I've done some thinking about that, sir. But I'm here to answer questions, so I'll wait until you ask," he replies, voice quiet.

Takeda continues, "What concerns me, Captain, is that you will be quite far removed from us. I know that you've been prepared for long periods of isolation. That's not as much of a challenge as coming into contact with... I suppose you could say, dangerous entities." The hint of a grin crosses his face. "I suppose I should just spit it out, then."

Takeda says, "For our entire history, the biggest threat anyone might face to their own enlightenment, is other unenlightened persons. That's one of the reasons we live apart, or indoctrinate ourselves to maintain our own ideals even among those who do not share them. But people are one order of challenge. I'm concerned about what you encountered at Icereach, that it might be part of something larger. If so... well, it may not be just a threat to Gnosis, it could also be a threat to humanity in general."

Takeda finally asks, "What I wish to know, Captain, is what we might do about such a threat."

Jiro thinks carefully. "I would say, sir, that it depends on the nature of the threat. If it isn't truly sentient, the possibility of containment exists. If it opposes humanity on grounds of resources, either we or it can relocate. If it opposes humanity on principle, then.. we must oppose it too, or die." He gathers his words in a silent reverie, then continues. "At that point we'd have to decide whether our survival or its was more important, if no compromise could be reached."

Takeda strokes his chin and considers. "Interesting. There has been some debate - abstract to this point, of course - about whether to extend that consideration to a non-human entity. It speaks well of you that you would give that consideration to an... alien." He seems surprised to hear the word come out of his own mouth.

"Self-awareness is the fusion of reason and free-will, the ability to dictate the premises by which your logic operates," the cleric replies. "I would think sentient beings deserve the same consideration, whether human or otherwise. Whether that conviction will hold true in the face of a real encounter with such a being is.. not something I'm completely confident of, sir. But it is how I feel at this time."

Takeda nods. "We have little in the way of doctrine or dogma to offer as a guide for such. Part of the reason that you were selected is because we believe you will see a clear path to our intentions, in the absence of those instructions."

Jiro allows himself a small chuckle. "What you mean to say is I'm a stubborn jackass at times, sir," he offers.

Takeda emits a mild snort. "Touche, Captain. Well, almost. We do not believe your gnosis or your loyalty will be easily shaken. I sincerely hope that you will return to us in several months, or even in several years, as a hero." He frowns. "But there's also the reality that you may learn things that put you... well, beyond our understanding of Gnosis. The effort to reactivate the Stargates is, by some measures, an effort to repair some fallen angels. I don't know if I should envy you... or be relieved that I am spared that task."

Jiro reflects on this a moment. "Envy seems odd, sir. Most people seek gnosis through reflection, art and meditation. I'm forced to do it by approaching the Aeons themselves." He smiles, then continues more soberly. "It seems like this is my path, sir. And if it's not too presumptuous, I would like to think it will lead somewere grand and glorious. Every canyon carved by a river started with one drop of water, separated from its former home. To think myself unworthy of that role suggests this mission is guided by hubris, which is obviously an important problem. But I don't believe that. I'd rather believe that.. well, things were meant this way. Some drop had to go first. Some man had to take the first step."

Takeda nods. "I simply meant that the opportunity to serve, in spite of the risks... well, much of my time is occupied with planning and supervision these days. Paper-pushing, as it were. Perhaps you will bring something back to share with the rest of us." He taps a few keys on his desk. "Which brings us to the other thing I wanted to cover. We've decided to assign you some special equipment."

A hologram of a device, looking much like a pocket computer, appears in the air over Takeda's desk. It rotates slowly. The scale indicates that it is about the size and shape of a paperback book. There are few controls on the surface, but one edge is covered in imagine sensors and holographic projectors. "You may recognize this. It's a dedicated computer for running personality simulators. We've decided to assign one to you. This one will be programmed as an expert system in ethics and philosophy. The personality simulator will serve as a user interface so you can consult with it via conversation."

As the hologram turns, Takeda continues, "This one is programmed with a simulation of Victor Fu Sha Ming, a zen gnostic philosopher of the 23rd century. Even though he predates us by several centuries, our founders took much inspiration from his writings, and programmed these simulations as an aid to their meditations. This is the eight hundred and fifth such simulation." He frowns. "I'm told that it... he... well, whatever you prefer... is very old. The module was last reset just after the Crash. It's had time to develop some quirks. However, he is our best program on the subject."

Jiro's eyes widen. A brief consciousness of the magnitude of man-years involved in the creation of such a thing passes through his mind. "I understand, sir. I'll make the best use I can of it."

"Please do," Takeda says. "He can serve as an advisor; and perhaps he can aid you in teaching us what you learn when you return. You may take posession of Victor-805 at the Hall of Mentors this evening, and you can pick up your armor at Fort Refuge tomorrow. I see by the clock that the rest of the crew will be arriving shortly. You'll probably want to meet them at the airfield; liason officers are waiting in the garage with vans."

Takeda stands and waves his hand over the desk, and the hologram fades. He bows, and then extends his hand. "Thank you for your time, Captain. I look forward to hearing your report upon your return."

---

The next day, everyone heads for the Hall of Mentors. Like so many buildings in the City, it is a cavernous structure with a vaulted main hall. The hall is lined with marble obelisks in a variety of colors. Some have holographic projectors built into them, that display an image of figures seated in meditation. The figures cover many different races and styles of dress. You count over fifty such obelisks.

The cleric is joined by his colleagues, to whom he is explaining the basic theory. "You understand the principle of a painting - to artistically render some scene, real or imaginary. A novel, similarly, is the rendering of real elements into a fictional narrative. These things are considered art. The Exiles have developed a new type of art form. We seek to study the elements of a person - an artist, thinker, philosopher, scientist or luminary - and render those elements into a coherent whole. In other words, we create an art form based on a life, and it's conceivable that this model can produce works on its own, synthesized from the constituent elements of the source. For example, the simulation of a writer can produce books that sound like what that writer would produce, even if they aren't 'real art' by some definition."

Archer says, "Heh. Probably by the definition of traditional artists. For all their prattle about breaking new ground, they get real torqued when someone really does it."

Leandra will listen to Jiro and study her surroundings curiously. It is not home, but in her eyes this is clearly better than the rat-trap of other cities. "So your art is to capture the essence of what it is to make art, and so the art itself might create art." In response to Archer she says simply, "Nothing is original. Good artists borrow, great artists steal."

Jiro shakes his head as he walks. "It's not artificial intelligence so much as chaos theory in action. Our inputs produce high variability, that seem like new creative works. The formula itself - our model of the artist or thinker - is always static, which divides it from being a true thinking being."

Archer says, "It's all a bit esoteric, I think... but then, I've not got all that much use for traditional artists, either."

A voice states, "You have a remarkable grasp of what we do here, for one who does not study such things for a living, Captain." A walks towards the group from the wings, wearing a simple white robe trimmed with black bands around the sleeves. "Welcome to the Hall of Mentors, Captian Uzuki. I am Nolan. Colonel Takeda sent word to expect you today." He turns and bows to the others as well. "And welcome, our guests."

Jiro introduces each in turn, politely, then continues. "We're at your disposal, Nolan."

Archer returns the bow politely, trying to match it, as he is introduced.

Leandra offers a bow to Nolan but says nothing. She looks around for a moment more, than shifts her attention to Nolan again.

Nolan nods, and pushes his robe off of his salt-and-pepper hair. "If you'd follow me, then. Victor-805 is one of our oldest Mentors. We've been working to make him operational on one of the embeddable simulators left over from before the Crash, so we've transferred those systems to our workshop." He leads the way to a flight of stone steps in a corner of the back wall.

The workshop is built of the same stone-like material, but without the vaulted ceiling. It also appears less mystical and more technical. Obelisks similar to those seen in the main hall are in various states of repair. With the sides removed, the exposed computer systems are just as impressive. Some appear to be solid sheets of crystal, others are more mundane circuit boards. Sliding partitions seperate work areas. Nolan leads you through the maze of benches and walls to a partitioned area containing an empty obelisk and a workbench. The workbench is cluttered with tools, except in one clear area, where a pocket computer identical to the one that Jiro saw in Takeda's hologram rests.

Nolan speaks towards the box. "Victor-805, recognize Nolan and boot."

A moment passes, and then a hologram of a man in robes similar to Nolan's appears. It is both larger and more solid than the ones projected by the obelisks in the main hall; in fact, the hologram is life-size and moves with a fluidity that belies its virtual origin. The figure blinks, and bows. "Good morning. As you must know, I am the 805th simulation of Victor Fu Sha Ming. Are these to be my pupils?"

Nolan says, "Yes, Victor. It is as you were informed. If everyone would please introduce themselves?"

Stepping forward, Jiro bows politely before addressing himself to the simulation. "Jiro Uzuki. I hold the rank of Captain in the Exile armed forces. My title is cleric. I am your principal contact."

Archer bows in return, though he feels just a touch self-conscious about it. "Archibald Collins, command pilot for the Aurora expedition. You can call me Archer."

Leandra bows to the hologram respectfully. "It is an honor to meet you, 805th simulation of Victor Fu Sha Ming, I am Leandra Cal Maratain ve Maraan of Coulam."

Oi has been lagging behind the group, poking into the piles of circuit boards and spare parts in the bins around the cube. He realizes that the silence is directed at him. "Oh! Uh... Oi. Oi Vey, of Domwun... the Domwun Terraforming Bureau. "He peers at the hologram and at its physical vessel. "How many of these did you say you had? I didn't think there were any left like this!"

Nolan rolls his eyes, out of sight of Oi. "There aren't. They're considered strategic assets and we're blessed to be entrusted with them. And we'd be extraordinarily upset if any of them were to be _damaged_."

Oi seems to take the hint, and shoves his hands in his pockets. "Right. Of course. 'sall good, it is. I'll just... umm... stand over here, then."

The program called Victor has been watching the interchange with some amusement. A toothy and sarcastic grin crosses its face; it resembles nothing so much as a rock splitting open. It turns and bows to each of you, even Oi. "I have, of course, been fully briefed on your missions and your background. I must say that I have been looking forward to meeting _most_ of you. I will endeavour to serve with what wisdom a humble machine can offer." He straightens, facing Jiro. "Your role as primary contact has been recorded. I am told that I am to recognize your command authoirty, and so I shall." The it looks at Leandra. "I believe I may have known some of your blood-ancestors. I hope we will get the chance to speak of this later."

Archer raises an eyebrow at that. _Interesting... the machine knows more about her already than I do..._

Leandra offers a rare smile and nods in agreement to Victor, "It would be a great privilege to hear of the doings of my kind in the past. Perhaps you can tell me many things that we had thought lost."

Victor nods. "It is my role to teach of Gnosis. Teaching of other things, is an unexpected and welcome opportunity."

Jiro considers the construct for long moments. "Victor, do you have access to data sources beyond your own hardware?" he asks, somewhat curiously, but with a hint of wariness in his voice.

Victor says, "Yes, sir. I have a datalink to the local computing grid and I can access public databases. I am guessing you have a concern about chances of tampering. Please be at ease. My core programming cannot be remotely modified."

"Core programming can still operate on false data," murmurs the cleric, thoughtfully, then turns to Nolan. "Alright. Do you want me to take possession now, or are you loading this onto the payload before we go?"

Nolan adds, "It would be difficult to modify in any case. These simulator units have a high density and are also extremely optimized to their task."

Leandra is quite pleased with Victor, and bows to him once more. "It seems we will have to speak more later. It has been a delight, 805th simulation of Victor Fu Sha Ming. I look forward to hearing the stories of Coulam and whatever else you would teach."

Nolan says, "He's ready to go now. The power cell is good for several months; you can conserve power by transmitting video over a datalink instead of using the holo. Victor will use that method when possible." Nolan turns to the projection. "We're going to transfer you to Uzuki's care now. As always, you have your instructions."

Victor bows to Nolan. "I do. And it is not my purpose to question their wisdom. But I am amused by the situation, nonetheless." Victor straightens, the same bemused smile on his face, and the hologram winks out.

Nolan adds, "You can just call him Victor, Leandra of Coulam. I'd suggest using his full name only when he... gets on your nerves, I suppose." Nolan checks a control on the simulator module, and then continues. "I wanted to make sure he wasn't listening. It might not be apparent, but this one is more willful than most of our Mentors. He's also the best program we have on many philosophical disciplines. As a scholar I find it an interesting challenge to work with." A mild scowl crosses his face. "As an engineer and a student, I find it a pain in the ass."

Nolan seems to realize what he just said, and composes himself again. "In any event, I hope that he will be of use to you. We are pleased to contribute to the Aurora Project in our way. Contact me if there is anything else you require."

Archer chuckles at Nolan's brief departure from urbanity. "I'll be sure to keep that in mind, then. Nice meeting both of you."

---

You sit in acceleration couches, surrounded by g-webbing that will adjust shape during flight to match the forces exerted by acceleration. Apart from the light pressure suits and flight helmets, it seems like a routine flight. Holographic and virtual displays appear as Archer takes the shuttle through the pre-flight checklist. There's a few muffled thumps as technicians remove ground service lines and close hatches, including a noticeable hissing as the hatches are sealed shut.

Archer obtains clearance, and the large aircraft slowly rises into the air on a thrumming of nuclear engines. Already the flight feels different from a hop in the VTOL. There's less vibration in the heavier shuttle craft, but also a sense of contained power - the rhythym of the engines can be felt through the acceleration couches and the soles of your boots, and in your teeth and bones.

At an altitude of five hundred feet, Archer shifts the throttles foward and shifts the thrust nozzles into a horizontal orientation, and applies thirty degrees of bank to the wings. It looks like more than that, and at 1.2 gravities of acceleration, the climb feels like you're leaping into the sky. In an instant, the Fort Refuge spaceport is far behind you.

Fifteen minutes minutes later, and fifteen miles higher, the sky outside turns to a pure, azure blue as the shuttle passes from the troposphere into the stratosphere. The engine pitch gradually changes as turbopumps feed water into the ravening nuclear furnaces to make up for the thinner atmosphere.

Several more minutes pass. The sky outside gradually changes color from azure to navy blue to a dark plum. The noise of wind whistling over the hull disappears and the only noise left is the engines blasting superheated steam into the void behind you. Archer closes the air intakes and locks down the control surfaces in favor of vectored thrusters; there's barely any atmosphere to be found outside. The shuttle is now flying as a true rocket at over six time the speed of sound at sea level.

At an altitude of fifty miles, an alarm chimes, and you are officially in space. The wings fold into the hull; the rearward cameras show the a vast contrail streaming in a jagged line for miles behind you. The forward display comes alive with plots of trajectories of your own course, of the Spacedock that is your eventual goal, and of dozens of other objects in low orbit.

Finally, at an altitude of 100 miles, the engines shut down. After an hour of continuous thrust, the transition to zero-gee is like stepping under cover after a hard rain. In silence and weightlessness at last, you have time to contemplate the sensation - no up; no down. With the noise of machinery still ringing in your ears, an old saying comes to mind... 'In one moment, Earth; the next, Heaven.'

The instruments show that the shuttle is in a circular equitorial orbit. From here, a single long burn on the far side of the world will allow you to intercept the Spacedock. The navigation radar shows a ground track in excess of twenty times the speed of sound. Cameras show the world of 55 Cancri 4, the world you know as Ayer, racing past below you. At this altitude, a single orbit takes less than an hour. Even though you launched from Fort Refuge at dawn, The terminator, the line on the surface between day and night, is rapidly approaching, and soon passes below you. The great oceans of Ayer stretch out through the night, dark and silent, illuminated only by sparse shoals of phosphorescent plankton.

Half an hour later, the shuttle is approaching DomWun. The same domes that turn radiation into electricity distort the lights of the city at night into glittering multifaceted jewels on the horizon. As Domwun drifts past, the shuttle crosses the terminator once again, and you're flying over the main continent of Ayer.

After a few minutes, Air traffic control informs Archer that you've completed your first orbit, passing south of your launch point at Fort Refuge. Archer restarts the engines, which come back to life with a muffled thump. The terminator comes later this time, and the apparent rotation of the world below you seems to slow down slightly as you transition to the higher orbit. A series of blue rectangles appears on the holo, showing your trajectory as an ascending tunnel of light. Above and ahead of you, the tunnel intersects the bright blue line of Spacedock's orbit.

Over the next hour, the Spacedock grows from a glint in the distance into a boxy frame of girders, habitat tubes, and space cranes. The outline of the Aurora is visible within, as a flattened wedge with rounded edges and a gleaming, metallic skin. A swarm of construction drones and men in vacc suits crawl over the ship and the dock. Flashes of welding lasers and searchlights are visible throughout the structure.

The spacedock's computers take control of the helm and draw the shuttle towards the Aurora with precise control. The relative velocities are reduced to a few feet per second. The smaller craft slips easily between gaps in the scaffold. The habitate tubes outside are as big around as the shuttle itself. The ventral cameras show a hatch on the top of the Aurora sliding open, a dark square on the polished skin. A pattern of landing beacons illuminate as the shuttle approaches. The thrusters fire sporadically, matching velocities and angles.

Finally, the shuttle comes to rest in the cargo bay as gently as a leaf on the surface of a stream. With a rattle and a thump, magnetic and mechanical docking anchors take hold of the shuttle. The shutter over the pod pay closes, and all is silence once more. A string of words flashes across the forward display in large type, readable through the entire cabin - 'SHUTTLE 1 SECURE ABOARD AURORA. MESSAGE TO CREW: WELCOME HOME.'

The airlock in the shuttle opens into an airlock inside the Aurora, the inner hatch of which opens into a corridor. The corridor is about three meters wide and runs foreward. It is well-lit and lined with some kind of nonskid material. A man is floating in the middle of the corridor, a few meters 'above' you, if the nost of the ship is considered up. He grins as you exit from the shuttle. "Well, welcome aboard! My name is Q'in. We've been expecting you, of course."

Archer chuckles. "I'd certainly hope so. Everything on schedule?"

The man called Q'in slips a headband on, securing his longish hair out of his eyes. "Mister Archer, right? Welcome aboard. As to schedule... well, we're way the hell ahead as far as the original one that had you four launching five months from now, but we're a bit behind as far as this impossible one where we send you on your way tomorrow. I'm afraid that it's going to be an additional 24 hours, and that's quite enough of a miracle for me.

Leandra looks 'up' to Q'in and nods. The altered body draws her interest, of course, but it has no other affect. Of course a Coulam finds the adaptation fascinating. "It seems that everything is in a very good state here, even with those alterations." she says.

Archer nods. "I think that's still within tolerance. Politicians... they figured they could just wave their hands and launch five months early because they wanted to take advantage of the 'right moment'... and those of us who live in the real world have to make it work. Why do they give the most power to the least sane?"

"The politicians have a perspective you lack, Archer," replies Jiro, smiling. "And you have one they lack. Society means you two admitting to each other that you have a blind spot."

Q'in flips end for end and calls back, "Because I can't imagine any sane man wanting the job. Come on, I know you've been here before when we laid the keel, as it were, but I'll give you the half-credit tour anyway." He crawls slowly up the shaft, obviously moving with care so as not to leave the crew behind.

Archer grins. "At least _my_ blind spot doesn't mean I can be blindsided by the Laws of Nature... but you've got a point, Q'in." He grins and follows Q'in easily, but waits unobtrusively in case the three groundsiders need help.

Leandra follows with care, but her grace seemingly transfers even to the oddities of zero-g. Or perhaps some part of her Coulam genetics 'remembers' how to handle itself with no such thing as down.

The Aurora is shaped like a flattened wedge, and is symmetric around both its vertical and horizontal planes. The shuttle bays are on the dorsal side, near the aft end of the ship; the matching bays on the ventral side are occupied by a pair of antimatter-pulse engines. The corridor where the shuttle docked is one of four that leads to these bays, that join up with a circumferential corridor amidships. That corridor gives access to the vast cargo areas between the four bays. The next few decks are occupied by crew facilities, laboratories, and workshops. With so much crammed into a small space, it seems like the ship should feel cramped - but it doesn't. The design of the craft has been optimized by decades of practice and with careful attention to the use of volume.

You're floating on the crew deck, on the same level as the circumferentail corridor. This is the most 'open' area of the ship. The four staterooms and the galley line the walls; the common area is a good ten meters across. The furniture is greyish in color, consisting mostly of cushions anchored to a sunken area in the floor. Velcro tabs are everywhere, providing a convenient anchoring point for small gear. Q'in does a few spins, and whistles.

Jiro hums to himself. "Any holographics aboard?" he asks. "Grey is going to look horrid in six months' time."

"Gobs and gobs of space, my friends," he says. "Odd that we live in infinite space, but a habitable volume, a tiny sliver so small in comparison, is the most precious thing there is. These things were meant to skim hydrogen from gas giants. Well, hydrogen isn't very dense. So you take out 200 tons of tankage for something that's less than fifty kilos per cubic meter, and you're left with a _lot_ of volume." He chuckles. "I might get me one of these when I retire, tow it out to the Belt."

Archer says, "Looks like you've managed to beat the schedule, Q'in. My compliments to the work crews."

Leandra is with Jiro on that sentiment. For one of Coulam, there's more than that, though. "I just hope I can maintain something of a garden," she murmurs. "A world without living green is a sad one."

Q'in shakes his head at Jiro. "No holographics, but the surfaces are under computer control. You can adjust the color scheme in broad strokes; change the ambient sounds and scents. I'm told you have some kind of AI with you; there's small emitters in the terminals, he should be able to project. S'bout the size of the holos here."

Q'in spins to face Leandra, his 'feet' pivoting him using handholds in the cieling. "Hydroponics gear is in Pod 8, aft of here, miss." He takes a look at her, and notices her odd features, but makes no comment.

Q'in says, "Anyway... most important change is still ahead. If you'll follow me, I'll show you the Cellar."

The 'Cellar', as Q'in calls it, is near the prow of the ship. It's a sealed cylinder, shielded against extremes of radiation, accessed by a narrow hatch in the roof of the foremost of the open decks. The hatch leads into a cramped crew area, containing four bunks with privacy shutters, and four space suit lockers. Forward of this is a small sick bay, and finally, a miniature of the bridge, with two command chairs stationed shoulder-to-shoulder. There's so little room on the bridge, that the backs of the chairs fold flush with the floor to allow crew to get in and out.

Jiro examines the chamber carefully. "Well, we should all bond quite nicely in here," is his wryly-spoken opinion, as he smiles at last.

Archer chuckles. "You can say that again. Is there a port for Victor in here?"

Q'in leads you into the cellar, and makes his way all the way to the bridge. He sits casually on a display console. "You could damn near fly through the corona of a star here and take less rads than if you were sitting on top of a mountain at the bottom of the well. Which I guess is the point. Bit of trivia, this whole volume is less than 40 cubic meters total. Hopefully you won't have to spend too much time here, but if you're going on your own into deep space, it's a necessity."

Leandra studies the surroundings and sighs softly. "It is a good thing I tested very low for claustrophobic tendencies," she comments. It's clear that even so this is not precisely her idea of comfort. "Nonetheless, there is work to do."

Archer nods. "In a way, it's a good thing that they did this re-route through the radiation belts. Made them pay attention to the radiation problem."

Q'in says, "Victor's your AI? Yes. There's a docking port for him here, and on the main bridge; I gather he can also use the local wireless link for low-res transmissions. Um... we were instructed not to give it clearance to fly the ship. That's your job, Mister Collins. I wouldn't think it would be much fun to let the machine do everything anyway."

Archer laughs. "You haven't met the AI. He's not a pilot. I'll not be letting him take over my job."

Jiro shakes his head. "I doubt he'd be capable of it. I certainly hope not, at least."

"He can do what he can do," says Leandra. "And only time shall tell what that might be," she adds, in typical Coulam fashion. "Now we do not know, and so we should not worry over it."

Q'in grins at Archer. "Too bad you weren't born with four arms, Mister Collins. Most of us space-babies wouldn't admit it, but I don't mind saying, you're better than some of us. Maybe some other part of your genetics makes up for only having half the necessary fingers, yes?"

Archer chuckles. "Could be. Seems the Coulamites think so, at any rate." He looks more serious on his next comment. "If we can, we'll bring you back some fresh blood, too. It's not on the official agenda, but ... I tried suggesting taking one of you folks along, but they wouldn't hear of it."

Q'in nods. "Oh, don't fret about that. I'm putting in for the engineer's seat on Aurora 2; and if you folks get the stargate at Crossroads online, you can be sure that there's a dozen families out in the Belt and the Jovians with their own ships, that will make the trip just to see what's been brewing out there these last hundred years." He leans across to a console and casually taps some keys. "We'll always be out here. Always have been. I don't mind waiting a little bit."

Q'in continues, "Now, we've just got a few final rituals to cover."

Over the next hour, Q'in confirms the voice, retina, and palmprints of each member of the crew in the ship's computer. He also transfers the access keys for Victor into the system, to allow the Mentor to access the library computers and passive sensors. Cargo manifests and schedules are reviewed; it appears that you'll have about 48 hours on the ship before the launch to get used to your surroundings and the microgravity environment.

Q'in says, "Now, last two issues. Aurora's still got her solar sail from when she was an unmanned gas skimmer. In fact, that sail collapses into a shroud around this cellar when not in use. That means that you have to go outside to maintain it. Since it's nanite-based, that shouldn't be a problem. Just be careful when using it in a storm."

Archer nods. "You've got the maintenance schedules for it?"

Q'in says, "Theoretically, it's maintainence-free. But... well, you never know."

Archer says, "Ah. Emergency maintenance requires EVA. Got it."

Q'in finishes, "And finally, a word for Mister Collins. This ship is on loan, generally from the various governments of Ayer and the various families in the belt, and more specifically from me. You may feel free to call her your ship when I am o ut of earshot. But remember who owns it when you're considering something that might get her banged up."

Q'in grins. "I say that because of tradition. But really, just make a good job of it. I hope to see you all again when you get the Crossroads gate online."

Archer raises an eyebrow at that. "Yours? Hmmm. Y'know, I wouldn't normally say this, but if it so happened that there was a stowaway, just remember to come out before we hit the first rad-belt..." He grins. "No, not really. But we'll take good care of her, Q'in. She's our way home, after all; we don't plan to get her hurt."

Q'in flashes an 'OK' sign, and makes his way aft. "Glad to hear it. Well, I'm going back to the Dock. Hit the intercom if you need anything." And you're left alone on your ship.

Archer sighs as the Belter leaves. "And back to work. Leandra, make sure everything is aboard and stowed properly in the hydroponics section. Vey, you get to run the code and make sure everything is working properly. Jiro, if you'll come to the bridge with me, we'll start preflighting the old girl. We've got a deadline, people, let's beat it!"
