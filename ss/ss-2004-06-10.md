The Aurora Team is facing off against a motley assortment of half a dozen drones in a sub-basement of the Embassy. The room is dimly-lit, the only light coming from the floods on your suits and the bright, pure colors of telltales and scanners on the rogue robots. The machines advance towards you; four scuttle on mechanical legs with a manipulator arching over their bodies, like four-legged mechanical scorpions; the larger two roll ponderously on treads. As you enter there's a whine and creak of machinery as your opponents come to life.

With the poise of a man on intimate terms with risk, Jiro brings his rocket rifle to bear. Ten gyro-stabilized rockets are spit out, the mechanism whining as it disgorges each. The low hiss of rockets and the muffled WHUMP of internal explosions are all that mark the passing of three minor drones, and Jiro's eyes are already moving away, seeking the next batch of attackers.

Archer notes that Jiro has killed off the 'bots on one side and goes to one knee, bringing his pistol up and bracing himself behind one of the crates scattered around the room.. He aims at the closest of the remaining opponents and carefully targets what looks like a vulnerable point.

Oi brings his military type training to bear... he levels his gauss rifle at the nearest of the foes. There's the curious sound of the gauss discharging, although a lovely chunk of the scenery is chewed into bits. _What in the world? I missed!_ Oi sighs, and taps something on his vid-glasses, switching the targeting cursor from the standard model to one of his own design. _No wonder... poor user interface..._

Leandra takes this chance to hit the dirt, so to speak. She knows enough to know that she's got no chance of doing anything of use, except to cause trouble. Her uses will be more apparent once the battle is done. If things go poorly, at least. She is going to just put as much debris between her and the enemy as possible.

The one remaining small drone, as if in response to the destruction of its comrades, scuttles to one side. Its 'tail' whips up across the top of a broken girder and a beam of blinding light sizzles from the tip, striking Jiro's armored left leg. Sparks fly from the strike and Jiro falls forwards as if his knees had been kicked from under him.

The air is pierced by a high-pitched whine and the sound of crashing metal as the two large drones pick up speed. Unbothered by the debris in their way, crossing nearly half the distance to the explorers in the space of a second.

Jiro hit the floor, at least carefully enough not to break anything. And now while the larger units advance, he shakes his rifle a bit, thumbing the now-empty APEX magazine out, and reaches behind him to snag a replacement casette. It's snapped into place, and he rolls again, trying to line up another shot.

Archer's careful aim is spoiled when the laser-tailed robot scuttles aside just as he pulls the trigger. He mutters something under his breath and retargets. Next time, the big ones will be close enough that he'll have to move.

Leandra sees the coming trouble, but has little she can do about it at this point. Her eyes shift to study Jiro. She sees no blood, at least. It seems the armor has done it's job. For now, all she can do is hope to not distract her friends from battle.

_There's a big lovely target for you._ Oi holds his trusty Gauss Rifle steady, watching as the little smiley face is brought in line with the robots. _It's too bad we don't have quad damage..._

The remaining laser-equipped drone goes to ground, ducking behind bits of fallen girders and shipping crates. It is no longer making much forward progress, and Jiro's prone position makes it hard for the machine to draw a bead. Nevertheless, it tries, and another cerulean arc of energy slices through the air over Jiro's head. The fire covers the advance of the two larger drones. On the side of each large drone, a panel retracts and a pair of manipulators unfold, with wicked cargo-handling claws glinting at their ends.

The cleric raises himself up a bit, bracing his weapon in the fractional moment he has - he might withstand the laser, but who else will fare so well? Another muffled explosion, and fragments and plates of structure are littering the floor around the ex-drone.

The second time around, Oi has taken the time to aim... and it shows. The little smiley face has lit up, and as Oi pulls the trigger, several rounds of magnetically propelled tungsten chew through the air and the offending robot. _Owned._

Archer settles in and fires at the cargo-handling bot, squeezing off multiple rounds - it's hard to tell if they had any effect at all on the thing, with Oi's gauss-gun chewing the thing up.

Oi's burst has riddled one of the larger cargo handlers with holes. Red telltales come to life across its surface, indicating the status of the machine; it wheels like an enranged bull with a whine of electrically-driven bogies and charges straight at Oi. The other splits off to roll at Jiro. With the cover of their laser-carrying escorts lost, the machines flail their maniuplator arms in front of them, smashing bits of rubble into the air.

The nose of the rocket rifle swings around and Jiro lets another shot fly. This time, even the hardened APEX round fails to penetrate, and a jarring detonation sends a sudden burst of light and sound outward from the front of the drone.

Archer fires again; this time he's sure he's hitting the thing, but he's not sure if the bullets are penetrating. _This is not a weapon that works against robots. I wonder if there's another gauss-gun in stock?_

The cleric tries to line up another shot, but a bump on the ground jars the ammo delivery mechanism. It will take only a second for immediate action to clear it, but it's a second lost, and silently Jiro curses his unfortunate showing.

The robot advances on Oi, who with a rather panicked expression on his face, swings the barrel of the Gauss rifle into line with the lumbering mass of robotics. Again he pulls the trigger, and the robot stumbles. It in fact crashes, its pincers crushed into its sides or splayed on the ground. The treads, as if alive by some other means still whirr... but not for long. Oi looks considerably relieved.

Archer stops firing as the hammer locks on an empty magazine. He pulls another one out and reloads...

Inside the rocket rifle, a .75 caliber round slams into position, held by the now-unjammed clips. With a grimace on his features unseen by anyone, Jiro tugs the trigger. The rocket round streaks upward, penetrating the thick armor of the 'brain case', and pieces of drone electronics scatter across the floor as the entire head-assembly is blown to flinders.

Archer finishes inserting the fresh magazine in his pistol and slips it back into its holster. "You all right, Jiro?"

Several seconds suffice to restore operation, and Jiro inspects his heads-up display warily. He watches the output of power distribution reporting itself, then flexes experimentally. Satisfied, he rises to his feet, then slings his rifle for a moment, stepping forward to inspect the drones. "There may be more," he replies. "Let's be careful."

Oi begins reloading his weapon and changes out the powercell. He looks around at the debris littered about the place now, "Nicely done Jiro. Very nice. Do you think we can salvage any of this stuff?"

"Right," announces the warrior-cleric, after a moment. "Our first priority is the power generator for the 'embassy' here. After that, forensics. Keep moving." He sounds gruff, determined, and unreceptive to commentary for the moment.

Archer says, "Considering that any active drones _have_ to know we're here, I'd suggest we keep moving."

With the mechanical threat removed, the big room appears less empty and mysterious, and more like a warehouse of discarded parts. The explorers walk carefully, picking their way through the remnants of a dozen or more destroyed drones... some from the fight a few moments ago, and others that are covered in dust. At the far end of the room, a metal stairwell surrounded by a crude, tubular metal railing leads down into a corridor, lit by slowly by a pair of pulsing bluish horizontal light-strips embedded in the walls at about waist level.

Archer shakes his head. "Those lights are really distracting. I wonder if it's on purpose...?"

"Gahhh... that freaking light is just... annoying." Oi holds his hands up, "Everything's so washed out... I can barely make out, errgh." Oi grumbles a bit more, as is his wont, but he'll follow the rest of the team.

"I'm using high-res ladar," reports Jiro. "No interference. Look away from the light, and follow me."

"It's a hypnotic pattern, do all you can to prevent it from interfering, else it will cause serious problems," says Leandra. "No doubt this is all a defense mechanism designed specifically to stop unauthorized entry. Or at this point.. nearly any entry."

Archer says, "Easy for you to say." He keeps his eyes high, though, and closed most of the time, following Jiro by the sound of his footsteps and peeking every few feet to stay on course.

The short corridor leads back towards the embassy for thirty meters. The signs of a gun battle are practically written on the walls - scorch marks from lasers, visible even in the hellish blue light, and bullet holes from some large-caliber slughtrower. The corridor turns right and continues for another ten meters or so, and appears to open out into a large room. It's hard to make out the details of the room from here.

"High-res radar looks clear," reports Jiro after a moment. "I'll go ahead. Don't look at the light. If you hear me call for evacuation, you do it. Understood?"

Leandra nods at Jiro. "We'll do what is necessary," she says simply. "And you will call us if there is trouble we can help with, as well."

The room is about ten meters across. There are four dome-shaped objects, slightly warm in thermograph, in each of the four corners of the room. Each is about three meters across and a bit more than a meter tall. They are unmarked and covered in a smooth finish, like polished marble. The center of the room contains a small dias, two steps high; the top is a glasslike substance. Lights flicker under its surface, which are only visible if you're looking right at it from less than two meters away. Four fat cables lead from the dome-like objects to the corners of the dias.

"So what do we have here?" asks Jiro quietly, looking about. What he sees is transmitted to his companions; their scientific knowledge will have to guide him. He is their shield against danger, but whatever success comes of this will be theirs.

Leandra considers what Jiro sees for a time and begins to dump information in her usual calm. "The room is covered in fused monocrystalline silicon, a giant quartz crystal. The middle section would most likely be the control console. According to the plans this is the backup generator room for the embassy. The dais is both a holographic projector and laser scanner that provides the user interface." She smiles to herself, pleased to feel useful once more.

Never one to dwell too deeply on technical matters, Jiro calmly and rationally assesses the situation, then projects his combat training and personal outlook into his own verbalized conclusion: "How do we shut it off?"

Oi pipes up. "I'll take care of that part. We have to convince it that it wants to turn off. Then it just does." He pauses. "Or we can just unplug it. Odd that they'd build a machine like this, and leave it vulnerable to such a simple thing." His voice brightens. "But that doesn't mean we can't do it the hard way anyway!"

"The dead men upstairs found it no simple thing," advises Jiro grimly.

Oi steps onto the dias and the holographic projector springs to life. The cold blue light in the room is replaced with a dim white light, and a solid-looking cloud of colors and shapes, like a swarm of insects, springs up over each of the four domed power plants. Oi frowns within his helmet, waving his hands, turning at the waist, crooking his fingers in odd patterns... he looks less like he's programming a computer and more like he's conducting an orchestra... or weaving a spell.

Several minutes pass, and the patterns of color grow and shrink, ebb and flow, and finally, coalesce into a single solid jewel the size of a basketball, one spinning slowly about each dome. Oi grins. "Got it. Now we just..." His voice is drowned out by a sudden hissing of white noise that fills the room; it sounds like the babel of a thousand whispers, as it did in the alley outside the Embassy.

Oi frowns, and his voice comes over the radio. "There's two of them. And they're at each others throats... we have to pull the plug, now..."

Oi stands on the dias, and resumes his impromptu dance. The glowing jewels flicker and flash; meanwhile, Jiro goes from dome to dome, and manually pulls the cables out. As he removes the safeties on the fourth generator, the sound cresendos into a voice. 'We die... we cannot die... these cannot hurt us... they are what we have worked for... they will come for us... they...' A moment of silence. 'Farewell, friends. We shall meet again.' As Jiro pulls the last cable, the projectors go dark and the hypnotic security lights go out, and you are left again in darkness, illuminated only by the spotlights in your space suits.
