The Walkabout shuttle passes low over Dromedary. The surface of the planetoid rushes by, cratered in some places, smooth in others; the instruments show a combination of cometary debris, rich in water and other carbonaceous volatiles, and chunks of metallic asteroids. Low-slung, blocky buildings periodically come into view - obviously artificial structures that the computer claims are very low-tech atomic power plants.

A large docking hatch comes into view on the horizon. As the shuttle approaches, the hatch covers retract into the surface of the planetoid, revealing a docking pad. The shuttle lands gently on the pad with a hiss of thrusters, and the doors close overhead. The pad descends into the interior of the asteroid and comes to rest in a docking bay a hundred meters across. The docking bay is crammed full of spindly-looking spacecraft, ranging from open-frame thruster modules that are little more than enhanced backpacks for spacesuits, to the blocky, engine-heavy tugs that you saw earlier. The 'tin can' sits in the center of the docking bay. It doesn't look like anyone else is here at the moment.

The instruments show that gravity here is minimal - maybe a tenth of a gee. The docking port must have been an airlock; the atmosphere outside the shuttle is breathable, if somewhat cold and stale.

Carefully Jiro straps on his weapons. He's wearing the light, sealed combat armor assigned to him, rather than his rather more intimidating battlesuit. The axiom of "form follows function" is demonstrably true in the construction of his culture's space-suits; he hopes the pressurized space-armor will be taken for exactly what it is. His sword is slung to the left, ready for quick access; his gyroc pistol, on the right hip. His face is clearly visible in the armor's plate. Taking a deep breath of the artificial atmosphere inside his suit, he cycles the airlock and steps out.

A few of the floodlights in the docking bay swing in Jiro's direction with a noisy whine of electric motors. The deck plating here is metallic, and the magnetic plates on Jiro's space suit find easy purchase, providing some extra mobility in the reduced gravity. After a few moments, the voice that identified isself as Windzi echos through a public address system. "Welcome to Dromedary, Mister Uzuki. Please wait for a moment. If you wish, you can remove your helmet - the atmosphere here is quite breathable."

Jiro carefully reaches up - his hands move steadily, deliberately, telegraphing their destination at all times - and unfastens his helmet. He removes it, then takes an experimental breath of the atmosphere. "Thank you for your welcome," he replies to the open air, inclining his body in a brief bow made clumsy by the suit. "I am at your disposal." He briefly casts an eye back at the shuttle, then looks around.

After a few minutes, a large blast door at the far end of the docking bay swings open. Six figures 'step' through, covering the distance in short bounds. Another six shuffle through behind, anchored by magnetic boots. The second six carry slug assault rifles of the type you found on the bodies in the Embassy. They line up on either side of the blast door in groups of three. They are not pointing weapons at Jiro, but none of them take their eyes off of him for a moment.

Jiro has his hands open - he's ready, but not overtly hostile, and he at least understands body language well enough to regulate his own. "I'm Jiro Uzuki," he says, waiting to be led or instructed.

The unarmed group stops a few meters from Jiro. They seem wary; four men and two women, all with the kind of carefully neutral expressions on their face that people only use to hide indecision or fear. Only one, a tall man with pale skin, angular features, and short, dark hair, seems openly hostile. He scowls at Jiro and refuses to meet his gaze. All are dressed in odd space suits that seem to be patched together from old and new sections, of different colors, manufacturers, and designs. One of the women, wearing a particularly colorful suit steps forward and returns Jiro's bow. "I am Shetal Windzi."

Windzi's eyes flick towards the shuttle. "You came alone." It is a statement, not a question.

The tall, scowling man speaks for the first time, in a quiet, and yet still harsh voice. "We should search it."

Jiro smiles, and steps forward slowly. "I came alone to verify conditions, but I come in friendship. You will meet the rest of the crew as soon as possible, circumstances permitting," he says, with a brief glance toward the second speaker. Then, in a more formal voice, he continues. "The planet of Ayer wishes to begin a peaceful state of mutual coexistence and benefit with the people of Dromedary." And with this he tugs loose the suit glove, baring one hand. While somewhat rough, with a hard texture indicating a life of labor, but it is warm, and human, and he extends it in a uniquely human gesture.

Windzi steps forward and clasps Jiro's hand. She is a good deal shorter than Jiro, maybe 140cm tall, and with short, curly black hair. Her skin is a dark brown, and her eyes are wide and expressive. She smiles diplomatically, although a measure of relief is also present. "We will be pleased to treat this as a diplomatic contact. I am the Chair of the Dromedary Council. These five others," she gestures behind her, "are the other members of the council, representing the people of Dromedary." She motions to each. "Mister Nunez, Mister Chang, Mister Santana, Miss Sosa, and Commander Miller." All but Miller incline their head warily.

Windzi continues, "The seventh member of our council could not join us in the docking bay. He suffers from reduced mobility. We would appreciate it if you accompanied us to the Council chambers; he wishes to meet you as well."

Miller repeats his earlier statement, somewhat louder. "We should search his ship."

Jiro holds up his bare hand and smiles. "It seems, Commander, that security is a concern for you. I wouldn't have come as I did--" and here he nods to the left and right, indicating his weapons "-- if I didn't feel the same way. Would the Council be willing to permit us a few minutes so that his concerns can be at least somewhat allayed? I'll be happy to show him the shuttle, though I'll be a bit put out if anyone dismantles it." He chuckles quietly at the last, as though it were merely a joke to break the ice.

Archer sends a comment on the encrypted band. "That's not proper diplomatic protocol, y'know. You should probably let them take a look, but make a point that it's not standard procedure."

Jiro's jest elicits smirks from the Council, and even a chuckle from the red-headed woman identified as Sosa. Miller's scowl doesn't fade. Windzi says, "Commander Miller, you heard Uzuki yourself. He's here on a diplomatic mission. That means his shuttle is under diplomatic seal." Her voice hardens. "And authority for diplomatic contacts is granted to the Chair."

Jiro nods his head slowly. "Well, if that's how it is," he says in an even tone, "perhaps we should meet first, and handle other issues later." He slips his glove back on, then uses the hand to gesture. "I am at your disposal," he repeats, indicating his readiness to move on and meet.

Miller folds his arms and drives a hard stare at Jiro. "Every diplomat knows the supreme need for precaution."

The Council bounds slowly back to the entrance hatch, taking their time to allow Jiro to move through the mild gravity. As much training as the Exile warrior has had, these people have lived a lifetime in space, and are much more maneuverable within the caverns of Dromedary.

Beyond the hatch, a single wide tunnel branches into dozens of smaller ones that go in every direction. Most are unmarked; presumably those that live here know their way around. The corridors are hewn out of living rock. Sometimes the floors are polished granite; sometimes they are raw rock, covered in metal grillwork. The corridors are lit in areas by low-tech flourescent light tubes, and in others by columns of bubbling blue-green liquid that looks similar to the air scrubber vats found on the Tin Can.

Windzi speaks as you walk. "We've lived here for a hundred and fifteen years. When the Crash came, and the Gate became uninhabitable, we retreated to this old mining colony. The easy radioactives had been played out, but there was still plenty of water, volatiles, and coarse metals. Everything our ancestors needed." She pauses and sounds thoughtful. "It wasn't easy. Lives were short, then. And they still are. For most of us, anyway."

Windzi continues. "We have managed some level of prosperity. There are several thousand of us now, and we've managed to build up this old rock so it can sustain us, even using such primitive automation. We expand when energy and time permits." She pauses again. "And so we appreciate the return of the Transfer Vehicle used by our Gate expedition. That was a... particularly costly undertaking. We still feel some of the effects." She can't keep a tremor out of her voice as she says it, but it passes as rapidly as it came.

Jiro nods slowly. He listens, and notes, and mentally assembles his diplomatic case based on the points being made here. These people waste nothing; it seems unlikely that they would waste words. What he hears are not idle history lessons, but statements on the needs of the colony, and when he addresses the Council, it will be his duty to have a reply for each of them.

Windzi leads the way through an apeture in the side of the corridor, which opens into a large amphitheater. Benches line the back wall; a long table sits at the bottom of the theater, behind which are seven metallic chairs - the center chair having a higher back than the others. A few dozen people are sitting in the benches and arise as Jiro and his escorts enter. A few exchange muffled words with each other.

Windzi motions to a desk facing the Council table and says, "Please have a seat. I think this part of our discussion should be formal and on the record. We will summon Methusalah."

Carefully Jiro sits at the place indicated, folding his hands and waiting patiently. He begins reviewing his presentation, and periodically checking the signal strength of his link to his comrades.

The Councillors take their seats, including Miller and Windzi. The armed men retire to the front row of benches, stowing their weapons in a rack by the entrance. After a few minutes, a man in a wheelchair enters the room through another wide hall opposite the one that admitted Jiro. The man is clearly old - very old. He has a mop of long white hair, but no facial hair, and both his hair and skin seem almost translucent with age. He rolls to the end of the council table and parks himself next to the seventh seat with a whine of electric motors. Behind thick eyeglass, you can see his eyes darting around the room. Even though he is frail and breaths with difficulty, he still gives the impression of being alert and aware.

Even though Windzi sits in the center seat, she looks towards the old man - clearly the one they call Methusalah - before she speaks. The old man nods, and she clears her throat. "Council is convened. We are hear to accept the formal presentation of the Diplomatic mission from Ayer. Let the record show that all Councilors are in attendance, as well as Jiro Uzuki of the 'Aurora', who we recognize as Ayer's Ambassador."

Nodding, Jiro speaks. "I would like to clarify that my shipmates are in radio contact through my suit," he says, in the interest of disclosure. "I'm sure you assumed this to be true, or could observe the presence of radio traffic. Because we represent several allied governments and factions, I would like to request permission for a full and open channel to the Aurora as well. I am the least scientifically-trained member of the crew, and they may be able to answer questions which I cannot." Left unsaid is that they deserve to hear the proceedings too, but the Council should know that well enough.

Windzi looks to her left and to her right, sizing up her cohorts' moods. Finally she says, "I think we should grant Uzuki's request. Please register your votes." The councillors' hands move to shrouded panels built into the tables in front of them; Jiro notes that Windzi herself does not touch any controls. After a moment she nods. "Motion carries. Perhaps I should explain. The risk of infiltration by hostile automation is serious enough that decisions to open communications channels are an executive matter. We are agreed that your request should be granted. A technician will arrange for a full-bandwidth audio-visual link to be relayed to this room."

"I understand your concerns," says Jiro. "Our own communications have been encrypted as a matter of course for the past century." And with this he waits, having bought a bit of time to continue to formulate his delivery.

A few minutes later, an indicator on Oi's panel indicates than a communications laser is trying to initiate contact with the Aurora.

A video projector flickers into life on a wall to Jiro's left, displaying a view of the Aurora's bridge. The other three crewmembers are at their duty stations. A murmur goes up through the few people gathered in the Council chamber, which quickly quiets.

"May I introduce Oi Vey, Archer Collins, and Leandra Cal Maratain," says Jiro, gesturing to his companions. "Our computer and systems expert, pilot and spacer, and scientist and doctor. Oi, Archer, Leandra, the Council of Dromedary," and Jiro names them in turn, acting politely. He grows quiet, once done, and awaits the commencement of formalities.

The Council begins with questions regarding the arrival of the Aurora at the Crossroads system - how did they get there? How long did it take to re-activate the gate at 55 Cancri? How did Ayer survive the Crash? Jiro acts as spokesperson for the group, directing more involved questions to the appropriate experts - Oi for gate physics; Archer for details about the Aurora and the flight; and so on. There is some curiosity about Leandra's appearance and the Coulamites, but no real hostility. The Dromedarians are impressed by the Coulam attitude of minimal technology, and their accomplishments in biotech and breeding.

After an hour of discussion back and forth, most of the councillors are in open dialog with the Aurora team. Some other Dromedarians filter in and out of the benches behind Jiro. So far, only the old councillor known as Methuselah and Commander Miller have said nothing. Finally, Methuslah loudly clears his throat and speaks. "This Councillor asks for the floor."

Windzi just nods at the old man. His reaches for the control stick on his wheelchair, and the archaic contraption whines out from behind the Council table and towards Jiro. He stops a few meters short of the warrior, and passes his gaze towards the video display where the Aurora crew is shown. He takes a deep breath, and then exhales, and speaks. "So... came all the way here from Ayer, did you?" His speech is distinctive - he has an Australite accent.

Archer's image nods. "Fair dinkum, mate."

Jiro's eyes widen, and he smiles. "We did, sir," he says. "And we intend to go back again, to report." He pauses carefully, then continues. "We'd like to bring along anyone who wants to go, who feels comfortable making the trip with us."

The old man snorts. "I haven't been out of this rock in over sixty years, mate. Bored in like a tick on a mutt. And I'm not goin' anywhere now." He straightens in his chair and looks directly at Jiro. "You know what it was like, those first years, when the world fell apart? I do. I was here. You don't know. You _can't_ know."

The old man wheels back a meter and waves a hand at the screen. "We worked hard to build what we have here... me and these Camels. The first dozen years a lot of us died 'cause we didn't have the calcium hack. Low-gee is hard on our old bods... mine included." He has a fit of coughing, interrupting his short tirade.

Jiro nods slowly, listening with respect. The old man is accorded honor by the Council; he feels he can do no less.

"You have done much with very little," says Leandra gravely. "And turned that very little into something wonderful." Still, his condition draws her concern. "Perhaps I should come and offer my aid. My medical skills may be of some use to you, and they are at your disposal."

The old man looks towards Leandra's image on the screen. "I knew a few of you when I was there. Always eager to help. Ya gotta understand, Lady. We didn't build all of this just so a lot of spacers from a world that had a luckier time in the Crash could come along like Angels and bail us out. That's not the way we play the Game."

Archer twitches an eyebrow and glances at Oi.

The other councillors sit back and watch the interchange with a variety of expressions. Only Miller maintains his hard edge. He still has not spoken, although the muscles in his jaw are working like he's trying to chew through plate steel.

Leandra bows her head to Methusalah. "It shall be as you wish it, but the offer stands if any would change their minds," she saves gravely. She does not react to any mention of a game.

"The Game, eh?" Oi chimes in, as best as he can anyway "I couldn't help but noticed you pronounced that with a capital G." Oi grins, "Fancy a new opponent, it'd be nice to see how..." _Probably best not to say geezer... don't say geezer, whatever you do Oi, DON'T say geezer..._ "Gee...uh... a more experienced player handles things..."

Methusalah looks sharply at Oi's image on the screen, his face screwed up in something that might be surprise, or disgust. "You the best they can do for the Game these days? Bloody hell! 's a miracle you got back into space! 'More experienced player', my bony arse!" He points a finger at the screen. "Call a spade a damned shovel, kid."

Windzi raises an eyebrow and clears her throat. "Methusalah... these are their Ambassadors."

Archer is rather unsuccessfully suppressing a grin at this point.

Leandra arches an eyebrow and has to make use of all her acting talents to appear as anything but exasperated. She can only hope the next people they find are not as insane as Methusalah. And it has seemed that they were so normal. A pity.

Oi will hear none of that. "Best they can do for the Game? Bah! We'll see who's what old man. Bloody hell! 'S a miracle you can even remember what a spade is ya geezer.. bloody old... 'call a spade...' bah... we'll see what's what!" He points back at Methusalah, "You're on."

Methusalah's old face splits in a grin, revealing a row of teeth that are, ironically, perfect. "Heh! That's yer first mistake, kid, you make the challenge, and that means I get to choose the arena." He cackles. "But I was the best in my day, no shame losing to the best. When you get yer arse over here you owe me a poker match!"

Windzi speaks up again. "Methusalah... give back the floor. You've made your point."

Oi chuckles, "And you made the second mistake..." Oi's mind races, _Poker... right, I think I've seen that program before... what in the world did it do... Poker... poker..._ He grins, "And that was accepting the challenge... still, there's no shame in beating the best, even if he is a bit... right... poker match."

Methusalah rolls back towards his spot at the Council table, waving his hand dismissively at the screen. "Enh. You'll learn. At least I'll have an audience. Oh, Windzi. They're really from Ayer. In case ye hadn't guessed. Do whatever deal yer gonna do."

Windzi folds her hands on the table in front of her. "Well. It seems that the Council has good reason to believe you are who you say you are." She flicks her eyes at Methusalah, who is still grinning. "We have just one final matter to discuss before adjournment. We're... curious... about the Gate. You claim to have deactivated the hostile entity controlling the automation. I'm sure by now you appreciate how that impacts our position here." She pauses. "I wonder if you'd tell us what you found on the Gate, precisely? What condition it was in? Any signs of violence, or... anomolous events?"

At the end of the table, Miller's jaw tightens. He looks about ready to spit.

Jiro nods his head. "I can summarize, Councilor," he offers. "And at your leisure, you are all welcome to review our experiences directly - our equipment recorded an audiovisual record of our time aboard the gate." With that he launches into an explanation of the dangers of the gate: of the embassy, the Voice, the waiting drones below, the shifting light that nearly doomed the expedition, and finally the reactor buried in the heart of the embassy and the final seconds before power was disconnected.

Windzi listens to it all and nods; the room is totally silent as Jiro finishes his story.

One of the other councillors, the one identified as Nunez, a tall, swarthy man, speaks. "So you overcame the drones with superior firepower... and the deceased men that you found, and returned in our Transfer Vehicle... they were all killed by the drones years ago?"

"We believe that at least five of the men were killed by laser fire," answers Jiro, calmly and neutrally. "The other two were apparently gunned down. As mentioned earlier, there is also the possibility that a second Transfer Vehicle was present on the gate, but departed. I want to stress that these are our conclusions on the scene. We do not present them as fact, only conjecture. The fact of the bodies themselves, though, is indisputable, as is their age."

Archer's hands start to move toward his controls, almost unconsciously.

Miller shoots to his feet and shouts. "_Damned lies!_ You read my report! They were killed by the drones! This is obviously a fabrication to drive a wedge into us! That damned machine is still out there now!"

The armed troopers rush to the gun rack and retrieve their weapons, standing by looking confused. The other councillors, with the exception of Methusalah and Windzi, also rise. There are shouted accusations, and above it all, Windzi whacking a gavel against the tabletop and calling for order.

After a long half of a minute, the room finally calms down. Windzi bangs her gavel a few more times. "There will be order. Now. Dammit! You all know what this means." She looks over at Miller, who is seething and florid, and points. "You'll get the benefit of every doubt. Until then, you retain your rank, but are confined to quarters. Bailiffs, see that it is done." She slams the gavel into the table once more. "Council is in recess until this time tomorrow."

Jiro rises, and bows especially low in respectful, mute apology for being the center of the disruption. He waits, however, permitting time enough for Windzi or another to attract his attention should they wish to do so.

Archer clears his throat. "Councillor - am I to understand that there is a missing, umm, transfer vehicle?" He looks concerned.

The bailiffs go to lead Miller away. One grabs him by the upper arm, and he shakes it off. He speaks with acid in his voice. "Keep yer damned hands off of me, you slug. You aren't worthy. I know the drill." He stalks towards the door. Four of the armed guards follow him out into the main corridor.

Windzi sighs heavily. "Not anymore, Mister Archer. I'm sorry. We'll have to discuss this later." She looks up at the vidscreen. "Consider yourselves our guests. I think we can dispense with the formalities for now. You're not the ravening Machine come to eat us, of that I'm sure. And as far as I care, that makes you our friends. Now please excuse me." She gets off and moves towards the exit; most of the other councillors and spectators have already left. You can almost hear the rumor mill buzzing around you. All that is left in the room is Jiro, and Methusalah, and the telepresence of the three on board the Aurora.

Methusalah rolls out from behind the table again, the whine of his electric wheelchair loud in the sudden quiet after all the ruckus. "Boy, I know ye didn't do that on purpose. Which is a damn shame. Shaking things up is an excellent play." He sighs. "I know they'll get through it. These Dromedarians, they're a tought lot. They've had to be. I think you can see why. This is going to make it difficult for them, but they'll figure it out."

Jiro shakes his head. "Commander Miller was part of an expedition to the gate, fifteen years ago," he says, quietly, in tones that don't suggest a question.

Archer nods. "And there was some question about what happened, wasn't there?"

Methusalah shakes his head. "No questions at all until a day ago when you lot brought back the other OTV. With two of Miller's crew shot full of holes. He said they'd been overwhelmed by drones." He shakes his head again. "I know he's got a damned good reason. Miller's one of the strongest of us. Leads the Spacers. Gets us more fissionables to keep going. But obviously he hasn't told us everything."

Archer says, "He could be telling the truth, even so. The bullet wounds could've been a friendly fire accident, or brainwashing by the Gate AI. We almost succumbed to it ourselves at one point."

Jiro thinks carefully, then speaks. "I don't want to lay blame without evidence, so I won't," he says, simply, in truthful tones. "However, we believe that it's possible - possible, mind you - that.. well, that a human being present on the Gate might have been compelled to act against his own interests, or the interests of those around him. If that were true, that man would be blameless. Your ghosts are not our business, sir, but if you need resolution to this matter, we will aid you, if we can."

Methusalah pauses. "That may be the case. But who'd have thought that old Miller would get run through by something like that?" He shakes his head. "The universe is getting too damn weird. I'm gonna go polish up my poker shuffle. Have a good night, young ones." He rolls off towards the exit.
