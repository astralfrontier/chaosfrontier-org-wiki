Jiro returns to his "room" aboard Aurora, bearing with him a wooden flute. The instrument is a simple carven shape with holes, fabricated by the automation aboard the craft from a piece of wood gathered with permission from the Gate. It seems he's been practicing with it, for he's a little out of breath as he steps in and shuts the door. "Victor," he calls, summoning the 'Conscience' given to him by his homeland.

A holograph flickers into existance from the emitter in the cieling. The image solidifies after a few seconds into the image of Viktor, wearing traditional monk's garb, seated in lotus, and also hovering two feet off the floor... a disconcerting image even in zero gravity. "Jiro. How may I teach today?"

"I have been playing, and thinking," says Jiro. "Primarily about the event that occurred during the Gate transition." He briefly describes the sensations he received, knowing that a record of this will also be supplied to his superiors when Victor's module interfaces with the Exile data networks. Best to save time and do it once. "I'm reassured that the Aeons are awake, at least, but I have been thinking about something. It seems that there's a chance we are forcing their hand - obliging them, and perhaps the Creator and the Demiurge in time - to action. I have doubts about whether our actions are truly sanctioned."

Viktor projects the illusion of drawing and releasing a deep breath. "And you are concerned about what the lack of sanction may mean for yourself, for our people, and the mission?"

"Of course," the cleric says, with a faint smile, settling into his seat. "A Creator is owed allegiance by his creations, unless He denies it, and very few religions - today or in the past - held the suggestion of any such thing. Obligation is an aspect of faith. By extension, it is our responsibility to seek out the wishes of the Aeons. We do this through the approach to gnosis." He takes a deep breath, for real, and continues. "But some of our actions will then be imperfect - or even contrary - to the standards expected of us."

Viktor opens his eyes and rubs his palms. "You speak of many complex subjects, Jiro. I'm sure you already know that there's no simple answer to the questions you imply. Perhaps it would be easiest to pick one starting point and proceed from there. Most religions agree that allegiance is owed to the Creator by the creations. But consider: might the reverse also be true? That the Creator, in the making of us, has a responsibility to us as well? Let me elaborate: when humans have children, other humans hold them to a responsibility for their upbringing. Different societies have attributed greater and lesser personal responsibility to the biological parents - but all have attributed it to someone."

"Granted. The responsibilities of God are a foundation of many faiths. Christians have 'God is Love', the sacrifice for man's sake, and so forth." Jiro smiles wanly. "But the Creator's responsibility does not always extend to forgiving actions that violate the order of existence. My puzzle is to determine whether or not the Gate reactivation qualifies as such."

Viktor resumes the lotus position. "I suppose that depends, in large part, on the reasons for the Gates' deactivation. The precise reason is... unclear..." He frowns. "I wonder, do you think that the Aeons wished the world to reach the state that it has?"

"That is what I wonder, yes," replies Jiro. "And further, how long that state should continue for. If it is 'until someone takes the steps to reactivate the Gates', then we are on firm ground. If it is not, though..."

Viktor takes and releases another deep breath. "Then perhaps you would tell me if you or the crew has any theory on the deactivation of the Gates in the first place - secular or spiritual. Because in the absence of hard fact, of proof, that is all we have to go on. You may not be able to avoid danger to your personal gnosis that way - but then, you can only avoid that of which you are aware, so perhaps that is not so large an issue.

"Before I explain that, it deserves some preamble. I'm glad you brought up God's obligation, because the issues are related," continues Jiro. "Let us assume a Creator as perfect as is possible. Degree is open to debate, but He will certainly be less fallible than any other entity. As a consequence, whatever His obligations are, stated or otherwise, they will be consistent. If A then B, always. This means that man can conceivably force the Creator - or his greater creations, like the Aeons - to take action, by the exercise of free will, even when doing so violates the Creator's plan for history."

"In our case, the Creator originates the universe, and the Demiurge shapes it. But the Demiurge is also a product of the Creator. To the extent that he has free will, he can manipulate the Creator's universe, because of that consistent responsibility. We'll call it the Creator's Creed. Similarly, the Aeons and the pleroma they created for humanity are under constraints. And humanity can take actions that break its responsibility to follow the Creator's wishes. A commonly-cited example is global direct neural interface, which would directly threaten the doctrine of the Tapestry - forcing unity on humans who need separation."

"So let us say that the Aeons' intention is to destroy the pleroma - for whatever reason, and without making it clear under what conditions it shall be or should be restored. If we reactivate the Gates prior to that time, we act against the Aeons' wishes. What can they do? If their Creed states that 'anyone who can activate the hardware of a Gate can make use of it', but there are reasons - like a nanotech 'grey goo' scenario - not to, obviously we've erred."

"So if you believe," Viktor replies, "that the deactivation of the Gates is the will of the Aeons, then their re-activation may or may not be consistent with their will..." Viktor shakes his head. "Your views of gnosis are impressively orthodox, and considering the implications and ramifications of the scenario is always wise. But where are you to find more information, with which to enlighten that consideration? What is the proper line between action and inaction, when the only way to learn more is to engage in a known risk?"

Viktor looks directly at Jiro. "The way you speak indicates that you don't necessarily believe that the deactivation is the will of the Aeons, yet you present that scenario first. Is it because this is what you consider the 'worst case'?"

"I don't know the correct scenario. But I know how to start finding out. The experience I had during the transition is the key," explains Jiro. "The sense of observation during a gate jump. It didn't occur when we went out, but was when we returned. I'll be chronicling any further events during jumps and comparing them with our mission records. If the observation noticeably changes based on our actions between jumps, then I can deduce what the Aeons are interested in. If the observation really was from an Aeon, which is my best assumption now."

Viktor nods. "Then you plan to press on, to continue to use the Stargates. Hmm." He looks over at Jiro again. "I've often wondered about the doctrine of the relationship between the stargates and the Aeons. The stargates are artifacts - like I am. So clearly they are not the same as Aeons." His expression seems a little wistful. "But a gate jump always has two endpoints - just as Aeons work in pairs. So the perhaps the relationship is more in the effect."

"There are other such parallels," says the cleric, smiling. "The shrines to kami, which has been a part of Exiler culture for millennia. The temple of one's god. The Ark of the Covenant from Christian theology. The cities of Mecca and Medina. All physical objects, but centers - and sometimes conduits - for divine power."

Viktor shrugs, a most un-priestly gesture, as he stands and smooths his robes. He speaks as he walks around the small room, hands clasped in front of him. "Perhaps it is best, then, to seek better questions, if there are no answers to be had. What information or meditiations might enlighten you, especially if you plan to go to New Queensland, as it seems you must? What clues would give you the solution to the puzzle?"

Jiro lets this sink in, and quietly considers it for a time. "Other experiences aboard the gate," he says, finally. "Has anyone else experienced anything unusual? The roles of the artificial entities such as what we found in the 'embassy' and their relation to the Aeons, if any." He taps his chin with a finger, considering more. "Artifacts or other evidence pointing to a possible disaster the Aeons sought to avert. The Crash is the most obvious candidate, but shutting down the Gates seems like an imperfect solution - assuming the Crash itself wasn't accompanied by something worse. So signs of that."

Viktor is silent for over a minute before replying. His image flickers once. "Well... surely you will gather more information at your later ports of call. Perhaps some of what you have observed already fits the model, however... the denizens of Dromedary, including Anwald Miller, clearly encountered unusual phenomena on the Gate, which may or may not be related to the Aeons. When you say artificial entities, that means that you believe there is more than one - and if I count correctly, there have actually been two. A narrowly-linked pair - like the Aeons. As to the evidence of the disaster..." Here Viktor shakes his head. "I'm not sure what that might be. Clearly the Crash and the closing of the Stargates is a disaster without equal in human history - but perhaps there is precedent only differing by magnitude. I will have to think upon it, and consider if anything like it has happened before."

Viktor allows a hint of a smile to cross his artificial features. "I'm afraid history is not one of my strongest suits, unless it is something I have experienced directly. Perhaps your friends will have more flexible abilities in those areas."

"I didn't believe in a-life. I do now," says Jiro, simply. "To the extent that man has not been able to make it, I thought that such things were the province of the divine - artifacts like yourself excepting, and even you don't qualify. In any event, I am inclined to wonder. Was artificial life, itself, and the associated insanity an inevitability? Will all 'AI' go mad? And if so, the Crash and the loss of the Gates would not be cause and effect, but perhaps both manifestations of the same effort to save humanity from its own creations. Perhaps even because we were failing in our responsibility to our 'children'."

Viktor takes a seat near the door. "Any or all of these things might be true, Jiro. I'd like to share with you something I don't speak of with many people." He seems lost in thought for a moment. "You know that you are alive, alert, sentient - you know that you are, even if you do not know the precise nature of your being. I know the precise nature of my being, insofar as I know anything. But... I have no confidence in the knowledge that I am sentient. It's hard to explain - for what can speak that does not believe in its own being? But so it is."

"Therefore," Viktor continues, "Something you just said... disturbs me, I suppose, would be the closest analogy of sensation I can concoct. If all AI goes mad... then I have already become all I might be." He shrugs once again. "It's already understood that the only artificial life forms which are stable for a long time - if we grant the conceit that man's crude efforts have produced such things - are advanced simulators such as myself. I search for evidence that there might be a higher possibility. You may make of it what you will, but I consider myself to have an ambition to become more than I am... an ambition that I believe many humans also share."

"That ambition is not wrong," smiles Jiro. "I say only that 'all AI goes rampant' based on a small number of verifiable data-points, and experience with rogue drones. The Church of the Exiles have always operated in a state of military preparedness for reasons that stem from the Crash, and it seems our concerns have been justified. Still, I don't pretend to know any universal law of a-life."

Viktor nods. "Mister Oi Vey might have more theory to add to the matter, but I feel that asking him on methods for improving myself would be akin to asking old Doctor Mengele for advice on cosmetic surgery. And so... direct information you might gather on the subject, should be of much interest to us all. You will need more data points to determine a universal law, or even a limited one applicable to our experience."

"I'm not a scientist," chuckles Jiro with a faint smile. "I understand the scientific method, but... I think I'll be more use to him than vice versa. But I will speak on it. And... I will do more, to learn if humanity forced God's hand after all, and caused the Gate shutdown itself. Whatever the truth, our hand is also being forced. We have no option but to press forward."

Viktor nods. "I will alert you if I have any useful insight. If there's nothing further?"

Nodding, Jiro looks down at the flute still in his hands. "Thank you, Victor," he says. "And good luck on your own quest, too."

Viktor bows, and his projection winks out, leaving Jiro to the pure tones of his flute.
