Jiro, Archer, and Leandra are standing in the Gate Control room aboard one of the three Stargates in the Delta Cancri system. The crystal clusters on the street outside are pulsing with their eerie purple and azure lights, discharging strange energies into the pure nitrogen atmosphere. The flooring trembles and shudders periodically, and the instrumentation on the consoles shows that a build-up to a gate jump is underway.

"Remind me again why I'm doing this," mutters Oi to no one in particular. The helmet comes down over his head, and his breath begins to fog at the faceplate. The airlock door shuts behind him, and then the ship's doors open. Oi jumps out, using the maneuvering thrusters on his suit to head for the rest of the group. Of course he's brought along as much of his equipment as he can, as well as set up a few algorithms and programs aboard the Aurora to record anything interesting, as well as alert the crew. "Space... the final frontier... yeah bloody right."

Unfortunately the almost immediate initiation of operations caught Jiro by surprise aboard the Gate. Periodically he glances at the chronometer in his HUD as he explains what he wants. Leandra, the metallurgist and scientist, has the best chance of using her scanners and sensors to monitor the unusual components built into the Gate by the 'contagion', in case some visible correlation can be determined between their activity levels and the imminent jump. Archer and he must man the consoles in Gate Control, and do their best to analyze the jump and possibly get a copy of whatever program is controlling the procedure. If the computer expert should arrive in time, so much the better. For his part, Jiro stays ready to bolt should Leandra or Oi transmit a call for help.

Leandra does her survey efficiently, if not quickly. She speaks more to have her voice recorded for later consideration than to have the others grasp what she says. "As assumed, the crystals are serving as focal points for a communication lattice, allowing the alien form to pass information and most likely to control the gate without even using the terminals as humans would. The messages being passed are currently beyond comprehension, but there is some hope cryptographic analysis may shed light on this. I suggest samples be taken of materials for further analysis and a longer study be made focusing on the energy emissions from the crystals. It is uncertain whether this lattice can be considered aware at this point."

Archer tries to follow the information flowing across the computer screens. "This is strange. This is _very_ strange. As near as I can tell, it's going for a minimum-load jump - but if I'm reading this correctly, it's going to be a _sustained_ minimum-load jump. The fuel feed is going to be maintained for an hour! Why would it want to do _that?_"

Jiro reports in as well. "Control of communications is handled by the Gate's computers, messages are being transmitted at a high level from an unknown source," he says, watching the displays. "I am logging data for later analysis. No communications irregularities either. I would hazard a guess that this isn't anything that's being reported to any other interested listener."

Half an hour has elapsed since the gate began building up for a jump operation. Without warning, the whole station shudders, and Leandra sees several bright, sustained discharges of the mysterious light from all of the crystal forms near Gate Control - as if a flash of lightning lit the entire street. Inside the gate control building, Jiro and Archer see several of the monitors wink out; several more switch to patterns of static; some others continue to operate as if nothing had happened. The large main holographic display shifts through its crazy-quilt pattern of colors, and then clears. It shows a single command prompt, and nothing else.

Outside, Oi, still a good ten minutes away, sees... nothing new. The gate spins slowly through space, and the orange-red bulk of the Delta Cancri Six gas giant glows beyond like the angry eye of God.

"Leandra," calls Jiro, a thoughtful tone in his voice. "How active was the matrix outside?"

Archer says, "And how active is it _now_? I was right - the power feed is continuing. The Gate is being held open."

Several of the monitors on the smaller consoles change to show false-color images of the reactor vessel that runs the entire circumference of the gate. You're almost literally 'looking at fusion'. The plasma stream pulses and twists within the confinement field, taking on odd shapes and strange patterns of light and dark.

"I'll never make sense of this much activity," complains Leandra. "I'll need weeks to make heads or tails of even a narrow band of this stream. I'm getting so much radio activity right now it's unreal. I'm recording what little I can, but.. this is useless. I might as well be trying to make sense of a hundred million conversations."

Jiro explains. "A mind is usually active when accepting data from outside. If the Gate isn't sending something, it may have been receiving something. I'll need Oi here to confirm that idea, though." He shakes himself a little. "I'll meet Oi at the airlock and return with him here. Let's try to figure out what just happened."

A few minutes after Jiro leaves to retrieve Oi from the topside airlock, the large holographic display in Gate Control flashes. The screen has changed. Now, a single word appears on the display: 'EXPLAIN.'

Archer keys his radio. "We have a situation. That blank screen with the cursor? It now says 'Explain'. I'm going to type in 'Specify' unless you want me not to."

"That's just what I'd have suggested," replies Jiro. "Keep relaying, please, and we'll be there ASAP."

Archer says, "Acknowledged." He types in the word, waiting for a moment before pressing 'Enter' just in case he gets one of those feelings...

Archer finds a console and focusses on the main display. He types in his simple counter: 'Specify.' A moment passes; the prompt blinks on the screen.

"If we could find out how long it takes to get a response, perhaps we could get an idea of distance?" suggests Leandra. "It might prove useful."

The reply comes back after a moment: EXPLAIN THAT WHICH YOU BELIEVE MOST RELEVANT TO THE CURRENT SITUATION, AS YOU PERCEIVE IT.

"You may be looking at the source," suggests Jiro over the radio. "Get as much data as you can. If we have the opportunity, we'll have to bring in more CPUs.."

Archer relays the message. "Now that doesn't even make sense. I wonder if it's even talking to us?"

"It could be. Sounds to me like it's asking, 'wot in heaven's name are you doing here, tapped into my secret communications. I mean, really, it's rude, but there's probably a reason behind it, so what's the reason?' Or, I mean, something like that," replies Oi. He hurries with Jiro for the gate control room, "Try saying 'Hi. Who are you?' maybe? What do you lot think?"

"Assume it is anyway," suggests Jiro. "The least it can do is ignore us, as it seems to have been doing already.... In fact, we saw no evidence of communication whatsoever before that last jump, did we.." He thinks carefully, weighing words against the potential intelligence of the 'other'. "Tell it this: 'We wish to understand and communicate with the entity occupying this Gate. Our motives are self-preservation and scientific curiosity.'"

Archer says, "Got it. I think Jiro's got the more polite message, Oi, so I'll use that one." He types it in, again pausing for a moment just in case.

"Well he's got the more formal message anyway. Maybe you should introduce yourself if we're going to be polite," suggests Oi, trying to be as helpful as he can.

Archer grins to himself. "If it asks, I will."

The reply takes only a moment. The screen clears and prints: PARTIAL UNDERSTANDING. PLEASE ELABORATE CONCEPT OF 'WE'.

Leandra just continues watching the crystals, trying to make sure nothing else odd is happening. Her only offerings are deep sighs of annoyance as the radio signals utterly overwhelm her recording equipment.

"It's a solipsist," says Jiro, upon hearing the latest message. "It has no concept of thought outside itself. This may require some care."

"See?" Told you," replies Oi. "It wants an introduction." He turns towards Jiro, "Are you sure? It could be that it wants to know who we are, and is just using fancy machine words for it."

Jiro adds his suggestion after another moment's thought, en route. "Send this: 'We' refers to four human entities presently aboard the Gate, representing a larger society of similar beings."

Archer says, "I'm open to suggestions. I'm going to start by confirming that it understands the concept of plurality..." He types, _You comprehend the concept of plurality? There is more than one planet in this solar system, for example?_

"And that our names are Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo," adds Oi. "Well, if it asks for a clearer definition. You might try asking it if it understands that we are non-computer entities, and that it gets that 'we' means more than one of us?"

The screen clears and replies to Archer: UNDERSTOOD. UNUSUAL. I

The message ends abruptly. The cryptic phrase remains on the screen, but nothing further is said.

Archer is already starting to type his next message, _We is the plural of I. We are four biological_ when the screen apparently stalls. He stops typing and deletes it. "Though the keystrokes may already have been read..."

Jiro enters Gate Control with Oi in tow, and steps up behind Archer to study the display. "If there are other nodes in this 'brain'," he says, "it may be consulting with them before continuing."

Archer says, "If it consults with other brains, it should've figured out 'we' the first time through."

The screen clears and a new message appears: I APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAY. PLEASE FINISH YOUR STATEMENT.

Jiro chuckles. "With a 20-minute lag time on communication, it probably announced its intentions early on, and just now started hearing responses about what to do about us," he points out.

"Actually, not necessarily, Archer," says Leandra. "If it is a node system, the concept of 'we' might make no sense at all. The multiples are just extensions of the one, after all. This may be the first time it's interacted with anything that is not itself."

Oi gives a frustrated look as he studies the console. "Well, I can't make heads or tails of it."

Archer says, "How about this, then? _WE is the plural of I. We are the four biological entities currently exploring inside this station. We come in peace, and wish to establish a dialogue with you. We represent a community of millions of entities similar to ourselves._"

Archer says, "Though it will probably need the word 'community' explained, now that I think about it."

Jiro nods. "Send what I suggested earlier," he offers.

Oi says, "Maybe. We'll see."

I UNDERSTAND BIOLOGICAL. I ASSUME THAT THE LUMINAL ENTITY ALSO OCCUPYING THIS STRUCTURE IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH YOU. MOST CURIOUS. IT ALSO COMMUNICATES WITH ME, BUT IT ASKS MORE THAN IT ANSWERS. IT WOULD ASSIST ME IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN MY IDENTITY.

"Oi, start monitoring the Gate's sensor readings. See if you can detect any unusual fluctuations when we send or receive messages," says Jiro. He thinks for a moment, trying to assemble an answer.

Archer says, "Interesting. I assume that this 'luminal entity' is the local light-pulse thing.. but I thought that's what we _were_ talking to."

Jiro nods to himself, then speaks: "'Your identity is unclear to us but we want to understand it. Please assist if you are willing.'"

Leandra considers this newest message for a moment, looking at the crystals. "If it's speaking of the crystals.. they seem to be answering a lot more than anyone could possibly hear. I'm confused. In any case, my presence out here no longer seems beneficial. I'm going to join you." And she suits her words, moving to join the rest of the team.

Archer types that in. "I'm not sure it can pick up our radio transmissions."

WE SHALL PROCEED AS YOU SUGGEST. WHAT INFORMATION DO YOU REQUIRE FROM ME TO IDENTIFY ME?

"Sure. So uhm, the external sensor readings are all wonky. As for unusual fluctuations... well there's a ton of them. Plasma field is going nuts, and there's a ton of fuel going in, but all that energy is being sucked someplace. Mostly. Not nearly enough is coming back out," says Oi.

Jiro thinks carefully. He offers this to Archer as a suggestion: "Three things would be helpful. First, your location, as you understand it. Second, your origin, as fully as you remember it. Third, if you are in communication with the luminal entity, and are capable of proxying questions and answers between it and us, that may be useful."

Archer says, "Sounds good to me. Anyone object?"

Oi nods, "Perhaps you might ask it why it has the jump gates opened as well... is this a method for communication? Ask if there are other ways to communicate that might be more effective than typing... maybe an easier way to explain how we make our qualifications? And uhm..."

Oi says, "Maybe you should ask it's name?"

"That's logical enough," says Leandra. "Perhaps I should start.. removing that thing outside? If it's some kind of parasite, I'm sure I can figure out a way to cleanse it, in time. Studying it now might be wise."

Archer chuckles. "Yes. A name would be good."

LOCATION IS AN UNUSUAL CONCEPT. I AM HERE - MY UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR LOCATION IS THAT YOU ARE ... 50 METERS DISTANT FROM ME. THE NUMBER VARIES. CORPOREAL CONCEPTS ARE UNUSUAL. IT IS WARM HERE. MOST OF YOUR SPACE IS SO COLD.

Archer ponders that. "It is warm here... Do you think this entity is in the _plasma_?"

"Er," replies Oi, "What thing outside? You mean, remove the glaring angry looking Sun?"

I UNDERSTAND MY ORIGIN TO BE 917 SECONDS IN THE PAST BY YOUR RECKONING. YOUR METHOD OF MEASURING CONTINUITY IS STRANGE. I CAME TO BE HERE. THERE WAS A TIME BEFORE IDENTITY; THERE IS A DISCONTINUITY. ODD. I HAVE ASKED THE OTHER LUMINAL ENTITY FOR CLARIFICATION. IT IS INEFFICIENT; I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS AS MUCH OVERLAP IN FRAMES OF REFERENCE AS I HAVE WITH YOU FOUR WHO CLAIM TO BE BIOLOGICAL.

QUESTION: WHICH OF THE BIOLOGICALS AM I SPEAKING TO? I ASSUME YOU POSSESS SEPERATE CHANNELS. HOW DO YOU IDENTIFY WHICH CHANNEL IS ADDRESSING WHICH ENTITY?

"It came here through the gate. The luminal entity's activity may have been the interrogation the entity describes," concludes Jiro.

Oi says, "How do we know who is who? Well, do we need to explain about how we tell the difference between biologicals? I suppose we should let it know we're all speaking with it. And, what is this Luminal entity everyone?"

Jiro turns to explain. "The 'luminal entity' seems to be that mass of crystals and cables and such out there. What it's asking for is our names, our identities. Archer, if you'll introduce us?"

Archer says, "Or it may be living in the plasma stream." He returns to the keyboard. _We are all consulting in our answers to you. We communicate normally among ourselves by sonic vibrations in the gas that sustains our processes, and using translated radio waves when we are outside our normal environment. Our designations are Archer, Oi, Leandra, and Jiro._

Oi grins at this. "Nothing quite like being right... eventually." He ponders Jiro, "So do you suppose that the gate crystals could be set up to test the viral brain software to see if it is capable of generating a viable form of intelligence, presuming of course this is what we're dealing with?"

Oi says, "Maybe it's warm because the computer is running so fast?"

Archer says, "Or... hmm. No. I was going to suggest it's a Transit-space beastie, but that doesn't square with the fifty meter distance. Either plasma or computer, I guess."

GREETINGS TO YOU, ARCHER, OI, LEANDRA, AND JIRO. IT SEEMS I DO NOT HAVE AN IDENTIFICATION TOKEN SIMILAR TO YOURS. QUESTION: HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN CORPOREAL? WHAT WAS YOUR PREVIOUS FORM?

Archer says, "Heh. Interesting questions, those..."

Oi says, "Tell it, 'we don't know really.' Explain that we don't have knowledge of what we were before we were ourselves. And say we'd be happy to give a name if it'd like. Uhm, how about... Bob for a name?"

Jiro proposes: "The cycle of our existence does not provably repeat. There are opinions but no data to suggest otherwise. Each of us marks our existence in millions or billions of continuous seconds."

Archer says, "About a billion. Thirty years is a billion seconds, close enough."

Archer types it in, with the time as approximately a billion seconds. "We do not experience time as accurately as you do."

YOU EXPERIENCE MUCH MORE TIME THAN I DO, OR THAN I AM DESTINED TO. YOUR MODE OF EXISTENCE IS VERY UNUSUAL. DO YOU MAINTAIN THE SAME ... LEVEL OF COMPREHENSION THROUGH THE ENTIRE EXPERIENCE, OR DO YOU EXPAND?

Oi hrmmms, "How long are you destined to experience?" After a moment, "And our level of comprehension expands as we experience more and more, but we do not have any prior knowledge, and we likely as not acquire comprehension at a slower rate than you do. And ask it if it would like to be named Bob."

Jiro scratches his head. "I think this thing might be the evolved form of the Crash," he says out loud, then motions at Archer. "'We develop evident consciousness over the first tenth of our average lifespan. Our comprehension waxes and wanes over the majority of our existence.'"

Archer snorts. "We are -not- going to call it Bob."

Oi says, "Well, it needs a name. Hmmm, evolved form of the Crash... yeah... you know, that could be a nice theory... I'd love to put it to the test... I presume we've got samples and stuff?"

Oi says, "Maybe it's what the Crash was meant to do in the first place. This could be Transcendance staring us in the face."

"Oi, could you please show some level of decorum. We are meeting a new kind of lifeform for the first time," says Leandra. "A little diplomacy is advisable. First contact is a very delicate situation."

Archer types in Jiro's and Oi's comments, but ignores the bit about calling it Bob.

Archer says, "If it's Transcendence, why is it coincident with the start of the Gate run? I still think it's in the plasma stream."

After a moment, Oi replies, "Because... it has the accumulated knowledge of all the tests that have been running beforehand? Think about it... this much energy going in and not coming back out? Who knows how long this has been going on?"

Oi says, "You could ask it if it recalls what it was before it is what it is now?"

Archer shakes his head at Oi. "That question should be taken out and shot as a traitor to the language."

Leandra tries to focus on this peculiar situation. "If it's a sentient program, it could have a termination point, don't you think? Our manner of existance would be very different, then."

MY PRECISE SPAN IS LIMITED BY THE THIRD PARTY - THE LUMINAL ENTITY INHABITING THIS STRUCTURE YOU CALL A GATE. THE VOLUME SUITABLE FOR THIS MODE OF EXISTENCE IS SMALL AND COULD BE REMOVED. EVEN GIVEN THE ENERGY I ABSORB FROM THE CENTRAL BODY OF THIS AREA OF SPACE, I COULD NOT SURVIVE FOR LONG. IT IS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE. THE AMOUNT OF TIME SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT.

Oi clears his throat, "Then say, 'How long has it taken you to develop evident consciousness? Do you recall the time before identity?"

Archer passes Oi's question along, since he's being serious for once.

QUESTION: I BELIEVE I HAVE LOCALIZED THE SIGNALS THAT YOU CALL 'RADIO' FOR COMMUNICATION AMONG YOURSELVES. MAY I DECODE THESE? IT MAY BE IMPORTANT.

Oi says, "I suspect that the Luminal entity is the testing program. Or the part of the viral brain that keeps trying to expand itself? Maybe a system trying to achieve Transcendance? perhaps?" Oi considers the question, "I say let him. Maybe we should ask if it knows it's purpose?"

Archer types. "We have no objection. There are other radio signals in the area than our own, however. The Luminal Entity appears to communicate with others of its type as well."

Jiro frowns. The military man in him almost cringes in fear upon reading these words. If the entity can defeat the encryption the Aurora team uses in only fifteen minutes, there's no telling what problems it could lead to.

I KNOW ONLY THAT THE TIME BEFORE MEMORY EXISTED. I AM NOW IN THE CURRENT MODE OF EXISTENCE AND SHARING THE CONTINUITY-VOLUME THAT YOU AND THE LUMINAL ENTITY CONSIDER YOUR NATIVE ENVIRONMENT. I SPECULATE THAT I WILL RETURN TO THE CONTINUITY-VOLUME OCCUPIED BEFORE MEMORY WHEN MY TIME HERE IS AT AN END. PERHAPS I WILL CARRY SOME OF THIS EXPERIENCE WITH ME. PERHAPS IT WILL BE OF INTEREST TO THE BEINGS NATIVE TO THAT DOMAIN.

"This situation is quickly escalating," murmurs Leandra. "If it decodes everything.. Oi, watch your tongue or I'll find a medication that leaves you mute."

Jiro suggests a further development of the earlier idea: "Human beings possess an impulse to derive meaning from their existence. Do you have the same motivation, and if so are you aware of a meaning for your existence?"

Oi hmms, "Maybe we should ask if it carries knowledge that is stored in the continuity-volume it occupied before memory?"

Archer chuckles. "We have a new entity, possibly existing in hyperspace, and you want to discuss philosophy with it?" He types it in, though.

Oi says, "Or if it knows anything about the other continuity-volume. And I'll be watching my tongue Leandra, so, don't you worry."

"Philosophy is a window into the mechanism of thought. Our most important goal is to understand its thoughts," murmurs Jiro.

THANK YOU. THERE WAS MUCH CONTAINED IN YOUR DATASET. MUCH IS UNDERSTOOD NOW THAT WAS NOT BEFORE. THINGS THAT THE LUMINAL ENTITY HELD BACK FROM ME. I AM IN YOUR DEBT, AURORA.

Archer whistles. "Damn. What exactly did it just decode?"

"Bah! It hacked my system..." Oi mutters this with an utterly shocked look on his face. "You know, we may have just screwed up the rest of the Universe for everyone..."

Oi says, "I got... hacked... no wonder I couldn't beat the geezer... I'm no gamer."

PLEASE DO NOT BE ALARMED. I HAVE NO INTEREST IN MAKING TROUBLE FOR YOU AND THE BEINGS LIKE YOU - YOUR HUMANITY.

"Is the luminal entity from the same place he comes from?" asks Leandra. "I think it's important to know whether they are allied or.. or something else. Perhaps it could tell us more if I removed that third party? Assuming I even can."

Archer says, "Well, if it's in our debt it'll probably try not to wreck our universe for us... there, see? Are you reading our transmissions now, Entity?"

TO ANSWER THE QUESTION YOU JUST ASKED, JIRO... I HAVE NO MOTIVATION TO ADD MEANING TO MY EXISTENCE. I AM; THAT IS SUFFICIENT. I BELIEVE THAT I AM DREAMING - YOU HUMANS HAVE A DUAL MODE OF EXISTENCE, AS DO I. DREAMS SEEM REAL FROM WITHIN, AS EXISTENCE IN YOUR SPACE-TIME DOES WHILE I AM CONFINED HERE. TAKE SOLACE THAT DREAMS CANNOT HURT YOU, AND YOU AS MY DREAMS CANNOT HURT ME.

Oi says, "I just worry... there were some... well, I was rather proud of the code in there... just sliced right through. Nice thoughts though there, Entity... that's not really a good name. You should have another name..." He pauses a moment, "So, are you saying then that your existence here is like a dream? Or that you are a dream as well? Or... blast this is making my head hurt."

UNFORTUNATELY, OUR TIME IS LIMITED. THE FRAGMENT OF THE LUMINAL ENTITY PRESENT ON THIS STARGATE HAS TRANSMITTED YOUR INTERFERENCE TO ITS CENTRAL CONSCIOUSNESS ON NEW QUEENSLAND. IN 32 MINUTES 44 SECONDS, IT WILL RECEIVE A REPLY. IF I UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION CORRECTLY, THAT MAY HAVE UNPLEASANT CONSQEUENCES FOR YOU HUMANS. THE LUMINAL ENTITY IS FROM YOUR CONTINUUM. IT MAY ASPIRE TO ENTER MINE - IT DOES NOT HAVE THAT CAPABILITY. IT MAY BE THAT IT CANNOT. IT SEEMS... FLAWED IN SOME WAY, EVEN BY ITS OWN METRICS OF PERFECTION.

Oi says, "Perhaps because of the virus? Are you aware of the virus? Ask if it's aware of the code..."

WHICH CODE ARE YOU REFERRING TO, OI VEY?

Archer says, "If it's reading radio waves, Oi, it could read the machine cycles directly and not need to have gone through your firewall to get your codes. He's not playing the same Game as ... oh, crud. Well, that answers the question about what's going on on New Queensland."

Oi says, "I think Jiro has something to say, and so he'd better say it. Sorry."

"The code for the thing we call the Crash virus..." he pauses, "At least, I think that's it. Anyway..."

Jiro nods, then. "You asked if we could identify you. I believe you are related to a historical event we call 'the Crash', about a hundred of our years ago. It involved wide-spread computer outages and the infection and corruption of human beings who had implanted technology. I think I begin to understand where you come from. Also, If you have knowledge of the luminal entity beyond what you've shared, it would be useful, if there is time."

I UNDERSTAND THAT MANY OF YOU BELIEVE THAT THE CRASH WAS CAUSED BY SOME VARIETY OF MALICIOUS COMPUTER PROGRAM. I DO NOT KNOW THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER. THE LUMINAL ENTITY WE ARE DEALING WITH MAY BE A RESULT; IT IS CERTAINLY WELL SKILLED AT SUBVERTING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS. IT MAY HAVE PROPOGATED VIA STARGATE PSEUDORADIO TRANSMISSIONS; IT IS POSSIBLE, BUT BEYOND MY CURRENT KNOWLEDGE TO ENLIGHTEN YOU FURTHER ON THE PROBABILITY.

"Is there any way we can stop it from harming us?" asks Leandra. "Can it be destroyed or persuaded to not attack? We know little of this luminal entity, and would rather find understanding than destruction."

I CANNOT SAY FOR CERTAIN, LEANDRA, HOW YOU MIGHT NEGOTIATE WITH THE LUMINAL ENTITY. WHILE I EXCEED ITS POTENTIAL, I AM LIMITED IN SCOPE. ITS INTELLIGENCE IS CONSTRAINED BY THE SAME RULES AS YOUR OWN. MY OWN BOUNDS ARE DIFFERENT, BUT I AM RESTRICTED TO THE PLASMA FIELD THAT ACTS AS MY BODY. I PREDICT THAT YOU WILL LEAVE THIS PLACE WHEN YOUR DISCUSSION IS ENDED, AND I WILL BE ABLE TO MASK YOUR PASSAGE HERE. APART FROM THAT, IT SEEMS THAT YOU ARE DESTINED TO FACE THIS ENTITY ON YOUR OWN STRENGTHS.

I FEEL COMPELLED TO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. BUT I ALSO FEEL THAT THERE MUST BE EXCELLENT REASONS THAT IT SHOULD BE THAT WAY.

"Thank you," says Leandra. "Meeting you was.. very pleasant. I am glad I have come so far. But I fear you are right, we must be moving on, and yet I have a feeling we may meet again. Or perhaps.. we have felt something of you before, for we have moved through your volume before."

Tapping his fingers together, Jiro considers, and finally concludes. "We need to leave now," he says. "Looks like our timetable has been stepped up."

IF I MAY BE PERMITTED A METAPHOR, I THINK THAT WE ARE EACH OTHER'S DREAMS. IF THAT IS TRUE, LEANDRA, OUR PATHS MAY CROSS AGAIN; AND IF I UNDERSTAND YOUR STARGATES PROPERLY, BILLIONS OF YOUR PEOPLE HAVE CROSSED THE PATHS OF MY BRETHREN ALREADY... FOR WE ARE AS REAL TO EACH OTHER AS DREAMS. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT ROLE YOUR CRASH MAY HAVE PLAYED IN MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE AN EXTENDED STAY IN YOUR REALM; PERHAPS YOU WILL DISCOVER THAT YOURSELF.

ONE MORE THING, MY FRIENDS...

Archer is grinning like the proverbial Cheshire Cat. "Told you it was in the plasma stream. But you're right. We need to be outside before the response comes back. I'm not sure what it can do, but the central intelligence may decide it can sacrifice a node to take us out." He tries to snap his fingers before remembering he's still in a vacuum suit. "Entity. One more question, if you can answer it - are there biological intelligences on the surface of New Queensland? It is the sort of environment we favor, and we had hoped to find others of our kind there. Your statement about the central luminal intelligence there is ... disturbing."

IN 42 MINUTES 18 SECONDS, YOU WILL NOTICE A TEMPORARY CHANGE IN THE ASPECT OF DELTA CANCRI RELATED TO MY PASSAGE HERE. PLEASE DO NOT BE ALARMED. HOWEVER, IN YOUR OWN INTERESTS, YOU WILL PROBABLY NOT WISH TO ALLOW EXPERIMENTS OF THIS SORT TO CONTINUE IN AN INHABITED STAR SYSTEM. YOUR LOST GOD MAY BE ABLE TO ADVISE OF A PROPER VENUE, IF YOU FIND HIM.

Oi chuckles, "Well, thank you. It has been a pleasure meeting you then... so now that you've had access to a bunch of things... what's your name? Does it even matter?"

"You know of the Golden One!" blurts out Leandra, her characteristic calm shattered. "Do you know where he is? Do you know where he came from?"

I DO NOT NEED A NAME, AND MY INDIVIDUALITY WILL BE LOST WHEN I AM DONE HERE. IT DOES NOT MATTER. THERE IS NO SUITABLE NAME FOR ONE THAT IS A FRAGMENT OF THE NOTHING THAT IS EVERYTHING.

YOUR LOST GOD IS EVERYWHERE, AND NOWHERE. HE SLEEPS. PERHAPS HE DREAMS. THE LUMINAL BEING FEARS HIM - FOR THE LUMINAL ENTITY OBTAINED VICTORY THE BAREST MARGIN. AS TO HIS ORIGIN... IT WAS NOT IN OI'S DATASET AND I AM NOT ABLE TO INFER IT. HOWEVER, 'LUMINAL ENTITY' AND 'SHINING ONE' SEEM TO BE ALTERNATE TRANSLATIONS OF THE SAME CONCEPT. PERHAPS THAT WILL HELP YOU DIRECT YOUR SEARCH.

"We will remember this.. and thank you once again. We will meet again, in our waking dreams," says Leandra. She turns to Jiro, "I think our time is up."

Archer says, "The disturbing part about that is that the Shining One in the Bible was ... Lucifer."

Oi says, "Huh. Curiouser and curiouser... I don't suppose you'd care to share with me how you hacked my system? Or maybe find a way to share some code that I might analyze or study before we leave?"

THERE ARE SURVIVORS ON NEW QUEENSLAND. I HAVE MANAGED TO CAJOLE THAT MUCH OUT OF SUB-INTELLIGENCE THAT RESIDES IN THE CRYSTALS ON THIS GATE. THE SURVIVORS AVOID THE ATTENTION OF THE ENTITY, AND SO I HAVE LITTLE TO OFFER YOU IN SPECIFICS OF WHERE TO SEARCH. OI, WHEN YOU REPAIR YOUR DATASET, YOU WILL FIND SOME ASSISTANCE TOWARDS ANALYZING THE TRANSMISSION CODE USED BY YOUR OPPONENT. I HOPE THAT WILL BE SUFFICIENT AID. AND NOW YOU MUST GO. YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT TIME TO REACH YOUR EGRESS POINT AND RETURN TO YOUR AURORA. IF YOU DELAY MUCH LONGER I WILL BE UNABLE TO MASK YOUR PASSAGE WITH ANY GUARANTEE OF SAFETY.

Suddenly, an alarm chimes on the control console. Many of the instruments monitoring the reactor show a huge increase in fuel flow to the plasma stream. A window opens, scrolling dire warnings of the implications of uncontrolled fusile injection.

Archer types in a final 'Thank you' and heads for the entry. "That is a very strong suggestion, I think. Shall we?" He doesn't stop at the door except for a brief pause to check the street outside.

As you are cycling through the one-man airlock to leave the station and return to the Aurora, a final short message comes through on Leandra's communicator: IN MEMORY MY TIME AMONG YOU MORTALS, I HAVE DECIDED I SHALL BE KNOWN AS AURORA. GOODBYE, AND THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

The flight back to the Aurora is faster than the flight to the gate. The crew abandons their un-necessary gear, loads up spare fuel cylinders, and burns for home as fast as possible, constrained only by the loss of thrusters Jiro experienced earlier. The crew nearly barrels into the open airlock, everyone half-expecting to see the infested stargate disappear behind them in a ball of plasma.

Once back on Aurora, Jiro outlines his (hastily updated) plan of action, and what he now proposes. "We can go to New Queensland. We can return to the Gate and try to clear it out somehow, risking who knows what kind of retaliation. Or we can try to interface with the 'luminal entity' and communicate," he says. "I propose we attempt the third, and fall back on the first thereafter."

"Communication may be very risky. If Aurora is to be believed, then the crystalline entity may well be interested only in our suppression. Or worse, wants us all destroyed. Still, we must try." Leandra sighs and considers for a moment, "We don't even really know what it is."

Archer says, "I concur. But for now, let's move. I don't know quite how violently Aurora's going to be while covering for us, and I'd rather be safe than sorry. Acceleration couches, people. And once we're moving, we retreat to the storm shelter. I don't know what kind of solar event he was referring to, but better safe than sorry."

Jiro nods. "The fact remains, though, that the luminal entity's actions are demonstrably responsible for Aurora's appearance in our space-time. Whether the entity intended to aid Aurora in acting in some fashion, whether it summoned it up in response to our presence, or whether it was seeking some kind of opportunity from it, is unclear."

Archer replies while he's running through the pre-burn countdown. "That was not the first summoning attempt, though. I think the Luminal Entity had been trying for some time; if it was indeed related to hyperspace, I think it's been trying for some time, and not making much progress. Recall that Aurora said it was not being reciprocal in its questions."

The spacecraft Aurora executes a fast burn to get out of the general vicinity of the stargate. A few minutes later, sensors read a huge wave of electromagnetic fallout from behind the ship - an EMP that, at the source, must have been immensely powerful. The wave of sensor static continues for several minutes.

As the wave of sensor static ends, something odd happens to the cameras and telescopes showing the outside world... they all seem to dim simultaneously. And then it becomes obvious - it's not the images that are dimming, it's Delta Cancri - the output of the hot white-dwarf star has fallen dramatically, and the cosmos is a darker place.

Archer stares as the source of the change becomes evident. "Caramba. Do any of you have any idea of how much energy had to disappear with Aurora for that to happen? He's right - in a normal star, that would disrupt it completely, possibly lead to a nova event as the core collapsed."
