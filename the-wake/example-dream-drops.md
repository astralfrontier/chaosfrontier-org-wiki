Dream drops are broadly catalogued according to purpose. Each one is unique, so only examples are provided.
# Arms and Armor
Arms and Armor dream drops equip the user with some kind of combat equipment, usually weapons or protection. Such dream drops commonly sell for a very high price, putting them only in the range of professional warriors and a noble's bodyguards.

* Claws: animal claws or talons, sharper and scarier than anything the user's familiar fusion might already have. The reflection of a dreamer's fear that they are becoming more animal than human.
* Knight's Suit: a stylish, ornamental suit of armor from the storybooks, sparkling with its own inner light. The dreamer's memory of chivalry, grand quests, and similar themes turns the drop user into a paladin out of myth.
* Legendary Sword: the famed sword of the ancient stories come to life. While it might look gold-plated and jewel-encrusted, the sword is an entirely functional weapon and can cut through nearly anything.
* Teeth: dreams of teeth are tied to confidence, and losing teeth can represent a loss of power or self-esteem. This drop gives the user strong, sharp fangs and reinforces the jaw, allowing a powerful and self-affirming bite attack.
* Vine Whip: plants grow out of the ground, providing a thorny whip the user can wield to scourge their enemies. The weapon of choice for a plant fusion, or anyone who really likes nature.

# Guardian
Guardian-type dream drops summon a living or otherwise animated thing to help the user. They are surprisingly cheap, given how many dreams center around someone the dreamer knows giving them aid and comfort.

* Bug Swarm: biting insects, spiders, or anything else the user's enemies are most afraid of. The swarm will not obey the drop user's commands, but will attack anyone who comes near the user. This sort of dream drop is rare, not only because it's hard for dropsmiths to make safe for the user, but because it's really weird.
* Dad: the dream-conjured archetype of one's protective and loving parent, as powerful as any child would hope. No matter how tall the user is, Dad will always seem taller.
* Horse: not a fast mount, but a hardy one. A riding animal that will obey the rider's commands and can last for several hours.
* Maniac: an insane slasher, berserker, or other kind of raving lunatic that haunts the nightmares of the young. Usually armed with some kind of short but very sharp cutting weapon, and can be covered in blood or viscera. If you can see its face at all - and if it has one - its mouth is often contorted into a rictus of dark delight.
* Nymph: born from dreams whose content is better left to the imagination. A beautiful, feminine fairy or enticingly masculine spirit being. While they can sometimes wield control over nature, they can also function as social companions.
* Pet: a friendly puppy, cute kitty, or something weirder and furrier. Fond memories of childhood don't always produce a useful guardian, but they have their uses. Pets are usually intelligent enough to obey commands and will have a strong emotional bond with the user.
* Rock Golem: natural rock brought to unnatural life. A shambling, heavy mass of stone that can punch really hard.
* Umbral Presence: shadow people - patches of shadows in a humanoid shape - are sometimes seen in dreams, or on the edge of consciousness. The drop user can summon one to conceal themselves, or to haunt somebody else.
# Wonders
Wonders are any extra-normal ability granted to the user.

* Blackness: a nightmare come to life, a swelling zone of darkness that seems to expand and pulsate on its own. Nobody inside the zone can see anything, and sounds are distorted or muffled. This drop would be more useful if the user didn't begin at the center of the effectâ€¦
* Campfire: a controlled fire, complete with enough fuel to last several hours. Fire is a very typical dream, so dropsmiths use this sort of dream as a test of skill or artistic accomplishment: how elaborate and useful can they make the dream for a user?
* Dwelling: a small hut, hamlet shack or crudely-built lean-to typical of woodcutters. The dreamer's memory of their modest childhood home come to life, hopefully with stew bubbling on the fire, comfortable chairs, and enough firewood and pipe-weed to pass a night in comfort. Powerful dreamers or skilled dropsmiths can bring out all the comforts of home; the less skilled can at least put a roof over your head for a few hours.
* Flight: a surprisingly common type of dream drop, allowing the user to fly through the air like a bird without wings. The flight effect is often tinged with the dreamer's own excitement (or fear of falling), if the dropsmith wasn't skilled enough to remove such traces.
* Hair: the user's hair becomes extraordinarily long, sometimes continuously growing. While the hair can be used to make rope or other such things, cutting it for such uses often leads to unaccountable feelings of fear, impotence, or depression.
* Invisibility: numerous types of this dream drop have been identified. All of them make the user harder to see (and often to otherwise detect), but come with a variety of drawbacks or catches (such as being unable to touch things).
* Meal: a dream drop can conjure nutritious, edible food. If eaten immediately, it's as healthy for the user as any real food. If allowed to sit for awhile, it won't go bad - it'll just disappear, optionally leaving you starving if it vanishes between consumption and digestion. Often used as a last resort, since some dream-foods may be inedible or actively toxic.
* Naked: dreams of being without clothing or equipment are embarrassing, but some enterprising users found a new use for this type of dream drop: hiding important documents, weapons, or other secrets by wearing them while using the drop, and waiting for them to reappear when the drop's effects fade.
* Oubliette: a hole opens in the ground, revealing a deep and ink-black pit. Anything thrown in won't be seen again, at least in the waking world. While some people might want to throw an enemy in, the size of the hole is variable, and you risk joining your enemy if your footing isn't sure enough.
* Song: the user is surrounded by music - an ancient, if familiar-seeming, melody. The song itself has no particular magical effect, but is calming and pleasing to hear.
