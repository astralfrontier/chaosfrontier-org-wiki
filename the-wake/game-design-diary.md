# Premise of play
* Explore and uncover the mysteries of the world
* Deal with Abstracts and keep people safe
* Experience life in a world where reality is unstable

# Setting technology

## Dream drops

* These are one-shot magic items, crafted from the dreams of ordinary people
* They are crafted through an ordinary chemical process, which depends on the physical laws of this world to work
* The skill involved in using them is to pick the right drop for the right situation, and use a drop's quirks to your advantage
* Until a drop is actually used, it's often hard to tell just what it will do
* Using a drop is always obvious, and creates a visual effect that can be seen for miles

## Familiar fusion

* It's easy to acquire a familiar, but not to acquire a specific type of familiar
* Familiars inherit a human's lifespan and the partners understand each other instinctually, but familiars are still just animals
* There are tiers of skill in using familiars, including:
  * Maintaining multiple familiars
  * Controlling the "slider" on how fused you are

## Phantom equipment

* You can acquire artifacts powered by imagination or the Wake
* Often these are ordinary items, like a stick or a rock, that have been transformed
* These are the equivalents of magic items, but they will always be unique, never just a "+1 sword"
* They cannot be deliberately crafted, only discovered
