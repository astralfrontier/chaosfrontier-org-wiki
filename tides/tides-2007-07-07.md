Once again the Horde expedition ventures into the caverns or Bael Modan, and once again they are beset by the caverns' native inhabitants, the troggs. Two of them are sitting around a fire as they enter the cavern, and as they issue their guttural battle cries, a third appears from a side tunnel, waving its own stone club.

Calling the aura of fire to his hands, Ezra releases a blast of flame at the leftmost trogg. Though his power is not great, the restraint he showed is still sufficient; the trogg screeches and topples in pain.

Alea'sha races out to meet the trogg in the southern corridor, moving along the wall. She stops and wheels her staff about, spinning the weapon about her back and slamming the solid end of it into the chest of the trogg with an unpleasant crushing sound. "Is there no end of these things?" she hisses.

The trogg roars with anger, and somehow its eyes seem to grow even more wild than they had already been. It brings its club up and swings it over its head, making a heavy crashing sound as Alea'sha nimbly steps out of the way of its frantic blow.

The smoldering pile of fur and mangled flesh that had been a trogg roars in agony, and staggers to its feet, finding new life in its rage. It staggers toward the white wolf and swings its club just as the animal jumps back away from its own prey, by sheer luck managing to catch it on the flank.

And its companion takes advantage of the distraction to smash the wolf heavily across its back.

Zul'Houngan walks around the edge of the cage, behind the troll that was bleeding out attacking the wolf, and conks him on the noggin. He goes down.

The Forsaken changes tactics. From his outstretched fingers, twin torrents of arcane energy flit toward the trogg facing Alea'sha. They strike it from left and right at once, and the creature crumples to the stone.

The wolf growls and lets fall from its mouth the rags its last attack tore from the trogg. Before it has a chance to avenge itself on its foes, most of them lie dead.

The druid moves quickly to support her friend, and as so many times in the past, she stands at his side once again, her staff lashing out at the enemy and just barely striking her foe, but where she hits, ice gnaws through flesh, biting at the very bones of her enemy's left shoulder. It wavers for just a moment, but shows no signs of stopping yet.

The wolf's yips and growls cut through the air and it rears up suddenly, slamming its enemy against the cave wall and striking out again and again with its teeth until at last it finds a mark, biting deep into the throat of its enemy and not releasing its hold until the enemy's body grows limp.

From this side of the troggs' campfire, Alea'sha and Zul'Houngan can see about a yard down the tunnel to the east, all the way to a huge boulder, with piles of smaller rubble around it, that blocks the path. It looks like it'd take hours of work to shift it.

Zul'Houngan wanders over, and looks down the hall, "Dat looks like some good work der." He scratches his chin, "Dem dwarves 'd make short work of dis." He looks critically at the boulder.

Ezra walks gingerly toward his companions, supporting himself with his cane, and peers into the gloom to the south. "Clever, clever," he mutters to himself.

To a casual inspection, the rock looks as if it had fallen from the tunnel roof naturally. A closer inspection from Ezra, however, reveals that part of the base of the boulder is actually fused with the bedrock below. It's almost as if the boulder had grown into place.

"Yes, clever, clever." The undead chuckles. "Not easy to move. They'll have to blast.." He hobbles away from the rock, pointing with his cane toward the southern tunnel. "What of that, hm?"

Zul'Houngan shrugs at Ezra, "Rocks not really troll thing." He shrugs, and looks over the bodies of the two trogs around him.

The southern tunnel, from which one of the troggs had emerged, looks clear as far as they can see, and they can feel air moving past them, deeper into the cave.

The troggs, as usual, carry mostly shiny stones and Titan carvings. One of them, however, catches Alea'sha's eye. Though the scaled serpentine fragment is just a chip off a larger carving, she recognizes the pattern of its scales as draconic in nature, and there are a few flecks of blue paint visible deep in the interstices.

Ezra chuckles. "More to the south. Another camp, yesss."

The druid looks over the serpentine carving carefully, a small smile curving her lips. "I wonder what the dwarves might tell me of this," she murmurs. "And I wonder what my friends back home might tell me," she adds more quietly still.

With some time now to see to her companion's wounds, Alea'sha lays her hands upon the wolf and lets out a soft sigh, drawing upon the forces of nature that permeate the land to mend the wounds. After her hands are drawn away, the wounds are far less severe than they were.

After a brief discussion, the team ventures south. As they approach, the dim light Ezra saw flickering at the far end of the tunnel does indeed turn out to be another campfire. As the tunnel opens out onto a slightly larger cavern, they can see a heap of skeletal remeains near the door - a carcass, well picked over and thoroughly looted, but in Ezra's expert opinion it was once a dwarf.

Also at the far end of the cavern are the corpse's likely eaters - four troggs, which turn to attack at the sound of the party's entrance.

Beyond the troggs, though, is something very interesting - a half-buried but enormous door, fifteen feet wide and thirty feet tall, decorated with a chipped and worn frieze of carvings. Unfamiliar runic symbols are carved over the lintel - whatever language they are in, it is not Dwarvish, nor any language anyone recognizes.

One of the troggs nearest the door howls and lopes toward the troll, its over-long arms swaying to and fro in its unwieldy gait. There's nothing unwieldy about the heavy stone club that slams into his midriff, though.

As the blow connects, though, the bitter fury of the elements rushes up along the club, and as the trogg backs away, its movements are stiff with cold.

Alea'sha pushes her way into the large room, darting around the wall and then moving out to strike at the first trogg. The blow finds its mark, but does not bring the enemy down.

Zul'Houngan says, "'s Alright."

Another trogg leaves its post by the door and charges at the intruding druid, who nimbly ducks under its wildly swinging club, only to be kneecapped by a third onrushing trogg.

Zul'Houngan says, "15' Cone."

Zul'Houngan holds the fingers of his right hand outstretched in front of his body. In his right hand, he shakes a little fetish rattle, Hs chants under his breath, and a cone of bright orange flame erupts from his fingertips, the flames licking and pouring over anything they touch, including the two hapless trolls in front of Zul.

Following the shaman's example, Ezra unleashes a rapid bolt of fire-magic at the most distant trogg in the cavern. The acrid smell of singed fur and the scream of a dying aberration fill the stone cave as Ezra takes his position between his comrades.

Once again with fire blasting the enemies the wolf dives in, its teeth finding the flesh of its enemy, but the bite is shallow, and does little damage.

Alea'sha strikes at the wounded enemy, but it is able to elude her ill-aimed swing with ease.

For all its adroitness in avoiding Alea'sha's blows, however, the trogg has similar difficulty hitting her back in return; Alea'sha nimbly backs away from its clumsy swing.

Zul'Houngan creeps around while the trogg is busy showing Alea and the wolf his mad dodging skills, and lifts his truncheon above his head, bringing it down squarely on the Trogg's head. Well, that's the plan. It works a bot more like clipping his elbow, but the trogg still feels it.

Again the brilliant purple flare of the arcane leaps from Ezra's outstretched hands. Again the twin bolts find their mark, bringing mortality to another of the misbegotten spawn of the caves. The Forsaken chuckles unsettlingly as the creature falls. "Now, for the interesting part..."

Zul'Houngan nods to the mage as Ezra steps forward, the troll shambles along, looking at the large ornate door. "Looks like someone already tried dis." He gestures, and looks around the door critically.

With the troggs out of the way, the explorers can get a closer look at the door. The carvings, chipped as they are, are detailed... and unquestionably depict a dragon of some sort, doing battle with various smaller creatures - though its quarry is vaguely humanoid, they are too worn for their nature to be seen clearly. Standing behind the dragon is a much larger humanoid, broad-shouldered with craggy features.

Above the lintel of the door, the writing still yields to no mundane efforts at translation. The door does apparently have a seam down the middle, as if it were meant to open as a double door, but it does not yield to pressure. In the center of the door is a cavity of some sort, apparently draconic in outline, following the increasingly obvious dragon theme.

"Get the dwarves here, yesss," murmurs Ezra without looking back at his friends. His dead eyes are focused on the door and nothing else.

Ezra withdraws something from his sleeve - a black feathered mass. It unfurls wings, revealing itself to be a raven. The bird squawks restlessly, but settles down after a few moments. It's not at all clear where he kept the creature, but it's here now.

The mage hurls the bird aloft and it wings its way toward the writing. Meanwhile, Ezra himself begins chanting. Streams of spellfire erupt around his feet, converging from chaos into patterns of ever-increasing geometric complexity, and disappearing completely after a few seconds. He cackles to himself, just as the raven's claws place themselves against the stone.

Alea'sha steps back, but her eyes are focused on the figure of the dragon. "It is fitting that the arcane should discern the meaning of this image," she says quietly.

As the raven touches the deeply inscribed runes, Ezra's magic earths itself into the stone, and understanding courses through the mystical link between the bird and himself. The characters read "Educational Facility: Ordering of Azeroth".

There is no other writing. None of the trogg carvings the party has found so far match the cavity in the middle, although the dragon carving they found in the previous room matches a chip in the dragon depicted here.

"A key, yes... keey, a key a key a key." Ezra is hunting around, staring at the freize and then at the troggs' corpses. He scuttles over to each body in turn, roughly turning them about and kicking them a bit, seemingly checking for something. "Must be somewhere.."

Further searching of the room uncovers little on the troggs but their typical gewgaws, but it does reveal another exit to the northeast. Another boulder is found there, but this time, they can hear movement behind it... getting louder.

Zul'Houngan shambles over and looks at the boulder, "That be not soundin' so good, der..."

The sounds from behind the boulder turn into a distinct cracking, smashing sound... and splits asunder. Behind it can be seen more rubble... but this rubble is _moving_.

Ezra's raven descends again to his hand, and he whispers fiercely at it: "Fly! Tell the dwarves."

Rumbling into the room, the party can see two hovering piles of rock, each formed into roughly a man-like shape roughly four feet in height, with two glowing 'eyes' atop their head - earth elementals. And behind them, another trogg... but this trogg looks different from the others. Though it's just as ugly, just as covered in unkempt and matted fur, it is also adorned with slightly more rags than usual, and crudely shaped symbols are painted on its hide.

The first elemental charges into the room, moving far faster than a pile of rocks has any right to be able to, and rushes straight at the wolf, lowering its head. The wolf, however, sees it coming and braces itself, and the onrushing pile of stones bounces off its shoulder, bruising slightly but otherwise having no effect.

Alea'sha takes a few steps to the north to move into a slightly safer position. When she finds the right spot, she focuses her will power and the natural power around and within her changes her body, granting her the strength of the bull, and at her side, the wolf experiences this surge of power as well.

The trogg shoulders its way through the tunnel and glares balefully at his enemies. Holding up a crudely carved stalagmite, it begins to chant in a guttural tongue. Its chant is far too primitive to be actual words, but the characters feel its power, as fear and doubt beats at their minds.

The other elemental comes barreling out of the tunnel, attempting the same maneuever as its companion. Not only does it fail to dislodge the wolf, though, it doesn't even manage to do any damage.

After narrowly avoiding the slamming of the towering elemental, the wolf darts forward and tests the strength of its jaw against the earth itself. It tears at its enemy, ripping through its unnatural sinews.

Zul'Houngan pulls himself up to his full height, pulling the wind totem from around his neck. Even in this dark cave, a slight breeze can be felt, originating from behind the troll, in the direction of the elementals. He draws himself up, and chants, low, and slowly, the wind picks up, as his fingers fiddle over the fetish. He glares out, finishing with the command 'Be gone!' The wind gusts, and what was once moving stone is reduced now to so many rocks, piles in front of the wolf and druid.

Through the sudden cloud of dirt and the sudden fall of rock crumbles, the trogg shaman is surprised to see a blast of flame. He hears a triumphant croak as Ezra releases his spell, and without time or thought to avoid it, takes the full force of the magic.

Alea'sha reaches down to a pouch at her side and with a graceful flick of her arm forward a single drop of water from a moonwell flies from her extended index finger. Her words are soft, lost in the noise of combat, but their effect is not, as a lance of silver moonlight blasts down upon the Shaman, searing him with divine light.

The trogg stands slack-jawed for a moment, as only a trogg can, as the troll disintegrates his earth elementals, and then flinches as magical fires ravage his body. But he is undaunted, trotting forward and chanting again, sending his own flames rushing over Alea'sha and her wolf, though the wolf ducks just in time to be spared the worst of the flames.

Zul'Houngan scoots over, and nods, "So. Two can play, non?" He gets a perverse smile on his fance, and preads his fingers out infronto of him, spraying another cone of flame before himself.

Like the troll, Ezra is fond of fire. As a master of the primordial elemental forces, he is less in tune with the land, more interested in mastering fire and ice as weapons of war. But he is no less deadly for it, and another blast of fire and a parched incantation leave the trogg nearly on his last legs.

Alea'sha again uses the power of the moon, flicking a single shimmering droplet of that clean water just before the light lances down again, scalding the enemy with its brilliance.

The trogg is in horrible shape, small fires burning amongst its clothes, black marks all over its body - but it's not dead yet, though it looks like it ought to be. Instead, its magic having failed it, it raises its club and begins to attack in the fashion of its brethren, swinging blindly at the wolf, though to no effect.

Zul'Houngan charges up to the Trogg, and swings his mace around, connecting with the trogg in the arm. Unfortunately, Zul can't put much behind his swings, and the mace just glances the Trogg.

The glowing balls of energy encircling the wounded trogg turn their regard in the troll's direction, but Zul'Houngan easily dances out of the way of their lightning bolts.

Again a firebolt flies from Ezra's hands to the shaman, and again only his mastery of the elements saves him - Ezra can feel the trogg's instinctive fire control asserting itself, turning away the worst of the flames. But even that rudimentary defense will not save the thing.

The druid no longer is content to allow magic to do her fighting. Instead, she moves in and with a growl she swings a thunderous blow with her staff, striking and then slamming through the midsection of the trogg.

The party travels past the remains of the boulder that the earth elementals broke open and finds another small cave - presumably the trogg shaman's lair. The trogg owned quite a few more baubles than usual, some of which look like they may have some minor magic - but at the top of the heap of baubles is the most important one. It is a polished blue stone carving of a dragon - and _this_ one looks like just the right shape to fit the cavity of the door in the previous room.

Ezra marches forward immediately. His bandage hand lashes out with inhuman speed and snatches up the carving. "Thank-yooooou," he mutters, then stalks back toward the enormous door.

Zul'Houngan stares at Ezra. He's not so worried about obtaining the item himself as... Hey.. Wait, "Umm.. You sure youse wants to do that right now?" Zul calls after Ezra, jogging, friendly like behind him.

Alea'sha frowns at the seizure, but for now, she will tolerate it. "I have a feeling that some of this belongs to the dragons, and little to us," she says gently. "I trust that when we are done here, the proper owners will receive their belongings."

The Forsaken chuckles. "The dwarves had better hurry," he mutters, glancing over his shoulder. His lambent eyes are narrow. He hunkers down, squatting almost troll-like and resting a hand on his cane. "Well now. Who said anything about belongings?"

"I'm serious. If we find proof that what is behind that door is property of the dragonflights, I mean to return it." With a laugh she adds, "Unless it's the black. I don't think they'd appreciate the gesture very much."

Zul'Houngan shrugs his troll shoulders, and jogs pazt Ezra, and to the doors, "Unlike the druid, I dunno whose is whose and what is what. I'm just not sure I want to try and handly the dwarves if it's open before they're here."

Ezra chuckles unsettlingly. "No guts," he observes, prodding at the disemboweled body of the shaman, ".. no glory."

As if in response to Zul'Houngan's concerns, two dwarves and a gnome come panting up, close on the heels of Ezra's raven. "We came as soon's we... by the Titans!" they exclaim as they take in the door. "Chomsky! What's that say?" one of the dwarves barks.

"We haven't stolen your glory," remarks Ezra, sounding somewhat dejected at the prospect. He tosses the dragon 'key' to the dwarven speaker. "It says, educational facility."

Zul'Houngan pulls himself away from the door as well, near one of the walls of the cave.

"On it!" pipes the gnome, bustling forward and holding a contraption with any number of whirring and buzzing wheels and some kind of lens at the front, which he aims at the lintel. Seeming not to hear Ezra, he turns a few dials, and reads a little printout on the front. "My... flying-machine is..." he begins, and then thumps the side. "Get it right! Blasted thing. Ah, 'Educational Facility...'" he trails off, glaring petulantly at Ezra. "I'd have got it right!" he pouts.

Ezra's laugh sounds like the last throes of an animal's death. Nevertheless he steps aside to allow the dwarves access to the door.

The dwarf in command has finally managed to take all this in. Looking over the gnome's shoulder, he says, "Ordering of Azeroth? Ye gotta be pullin' me beard! Ye realize what this means..." He looks down at the carving in his hand, and at the door. As if in a dream, he steps forward and puts it in place.

The carving fits like a glove, and its mounting retracts into the doors. The doors begin to shudder, and then glide inward, revealing the chamber beyond...
