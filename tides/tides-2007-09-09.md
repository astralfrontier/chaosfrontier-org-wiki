A week has passed since Jonah and his men arrived from Theramore, and the relief squadron of paladins and priests of the Holy Light have completed the much longer journey on horseback, with fresh orders for Jonah and his men. Whatever these orders are, they are to take Jonah away from Bael Modan, for he pays his respects to the defenders of the Museum and takes his leave.

Meanwhile, with the expanded guard upon the Museum itself, the exploration of the caverns can continue. And it is during this second wave of exploration that Ezra, Alea'sha, and Zul'Houngan make yet another discovery.

For once, this network of tunnels has shown no sign whatsoever of any troggs or trogg habitation. It's as if even the troggs are loath to come this way. Or the spiders, or rats, or anything else living. As they continue down the tunnel, Alea'sha's wolf whines occasionally, and the hackles rise on his neck.

Eventually, they come to a shattered doorway in the rock, the stone portal mostly shattered about its hinges. Most of the slabs are no bigger across than a man's forearm, but one larger slab six feet wide lies across the archway, with most of a symbol carved deep into the stone, a stylized abstract representation that corresponds to absolutely nothing recognizable to any living man.

Zul'Houngan looks at the door incredulously. "Somethin' big must've smashed that." He looks around at the rock for any signs of what may have rent the door.

"Oohhh.. Ohohoho... aahahahahaha..." Ezra descends into a fit of mad cackling, licking his lipless mouth through his bandages and wriggling his fingers. "Yesssss. Fascinating."

Zul'Houngan looks over at Ezra, "You Okay there, man?"

Alea'sha looks aside at Ezra, her expression a mixture of curiousity and disgust at behavior that is bizarre even for one of the forsaken. She settles a hand on the raised hackles of her wolf, trying to stay focused.

"The symbol is of the Burning Legion, yesss." Ezra points with his cane. "Very, very, very ancient."

Zul'Houngan looks at the symbol, then at Ezra. He has no further comment, however.

Zul'Houngan steps aroudn the rubble around the door, and peers through the portal.

Inside, the rooms are as smashed as the outer door. Great boulders have fallen in, wrecking nearly everything visible and blocking most of the accesses. It seems that some great cataclysm, or possibly just the movements of the earth over the long millenia, have distorted this room beyond recognition. Unlike the Museum of the Titans, this chamber was not built to last, and it has not. Some dust-covered shelves indicate where books may once have rested, and other shelves contain corroded and crusted jars. There are, nevertheless, enough carvings surviving in the walls to pique the interest of a dedicated necromancer, though they are not of any recognizable language, and something about the shapes of the letters are unsettling even to those who cannot read them.

Near the center of the room, surrounded by boulders, are two long, narrow stone boxes unsettlingly reminiscent of coffins. The one on the left is utterly crushed and smashed by fallen rock, but the one on the right suffers only the blow of a single large rock through the center of the coffin. Both boxes, or at least what remains of them, are carved with intricate bas-relief in the representation of humanoid figures, surrounded by more of the disturbing runes, and flecks of color are visible in the deeper crevices.

Zul'Houngan finishes stepping inside, carefully over the rubble on the ground. He looks around the walls and the books and things. He stands around the boulders in the middle of the room, and peers down into the coffin. Not touching anything yet, just taking a look.

Alea just barely enters the room, horrified by what she sees. The comforting grip on her wolf's hackles becomes a more mutual support. She keeps her eyes on those coffin-like chambers, as if expecting something to jump out of them any second.

The arcane once again brings comprehension to Ezra's mind, or at least partial comprehension. Many of the surviving runes describe the Burning Legion's plans to use necromancy to conquer the resisting night elves and capture the Well of Eternity for their own, and what Ezra cannot read right away represent fragments of actual spells - though none on the walls are complete enough to scribe into a spellbook.

The wizard, now mindful of the excavation and what it represents, has taken to scribing notes in a thick notebook. Despite its odd appearance, he has always maintained that it is not in fact bound in human skin. Now his quill pen quickly transcribes what he sees and knows, wobbling and spilling ink across the page in a mad haste.

As Zul'Houngan examines the coffins, though, Alea'sha's fears are realized - at least partially. A shattered slab of the more intact coffin is pushed aside, and there is an unearthly hissing. What emerges from the coffin is a bandaged head, shoulders, and arms of a humanoid figure, dust leaking from between the crackling bandages. Its eye sockets are empty and pinpoints of guttering red light flicker deep within.

Ezra immediately ceases his writing, and his notebook snaps shut with a forceful **clap**. His cane almost leaps to his hand and he readies it.

Zul'Houngan steps back as the ... Well, whatever it is starts to rise. He leans back, waiting to see what it does next.

The thing clutches the side of the coffin and tries to haul itself up - but its grip is shaky and weak, and it can barely support itself. As the shock of its emergence passes, the four adventurers notice that its free arm ends in a stump, and dust is pouring from the wrist, the arm shortening visibly even as they watch. The head trembles as it goes around the room, glaring at the intruders one at a time, finally alighting on Ezra.

Alea screams at the sudden motion. She'll probably deny it later. She doesn't run away, though its clear her feet are suggesting it strongly from the way she stumbles back. If it wasn't for her wolf, she'd probably have fallen down.

Ezra chuckles to himself. "Not Scourge, yessss. Too old, too old...." He scuttles closer to the coffin, still wary. "Ssspeak."

The thing's eyes glow brighter for a moment, and Ezra feels something unsettling stir inside him. For a moment, he remembers that burned-out house in the village, the family cowering away from him - and the stirring in his mind ceases abruptly. The monster recoils away from Ezra, hissing again as if struck, and its shoulders seem to slump... and with that, the rest of it collapses into dust, spilling into the coffin and outside of it.

Ezra slumps down, steadying himself on his cane. He wheezes, taking in air he doesn't need and exhaling, exercising his lungs only in an approximation of tension.

Alea'sha stays still, looking around and flushing a bit. She apparently isn't on the easiest terms with undead. Present company and all that. "What _was_ that thing? Is it dead?" A moment's hesitation, "I mean really dead."

Zul'Houngan moves over to steady Ezra, "Hey.. You alright there?" He looks the wizard over a bit, his rattle shaking a bit in the hand he's using to support Ezra.

"What's dead and gone... fire and dust... long ago.. " Ezra seems to be raving, but he regains himself after a moment. "I... a moment of madness. I.. I'm sorry." He prods at the ruined remnants of the corpse with his cane.

"Maybe we should leave whatever is in this room here. Who knows what curses they've left behind here." Alea sounds a bit more like herself, not as frantic as she was a few moments ago.

Zul'Houngan looks aroudn the tomb. "Eh. If you let the spirits boss you aroun', you'll never get anywhere."

Now that the tomb-creature has burned out the last of its unlife, Ezra can examine its resting place in more detail, and particularly the runes of its coffin. These runes are not simply words, but a magical inscription, that preserved the necromancy that bound it to this place. Though Ezra cannot do a full analysis of the spell here in the field, what he can observe, as he attempts to record the spell without triggering it, is that the magic is related to transmutation - shapeshifting, more specifically.

Opening his notebook, the Forsaken continues his transliteration. He seems to have completely recovered his equilibrium. Indeed, he seems to be almost cheerful.

Zul'Houngan looks over at Ezra. He would like, ask after the FOrsaken's health, but, interrupting him while he's studying doesn't seem like a long term survival prospect. Instead, Zul decides to investigate the other doors in the room.

The druid will simply watch Ezra warily, not quite sure she can trust him in his current mental state. Seeing him happy is just disturbing. Having it be in a room full of the works of the Burning Legion is hardly encouraging. She opens her mouth as if to say something, but thinks better of distracting the wizard right now.

"Do either of you have family? People precious to you, yesss. Wives.. husbands.. children.. parents.. people you care for?" Ezra asks the question apparently out of nowhere, writing just as steadily as before.

Zul'Houngan stops as he's peering into one of the piles of stones, turning to look at Ezra. He considers this for a time, then finally answers, "Naw. Goin' off wit the Orc boys doesn't exactly endear you to the hearts of young trolls." He sighs, and stares off into space. "Why th' question?"

Ezra just chuckles softly. ".. And you, elf?"

"There are some I care for," answers Alea softly. She watches Ezra very closely, "And what about you?" Do forsaken feel anything?

The wizard closes his notebook and turns, facing his companions with glowing eyes fixed first on one, then the other. "Imagine that it was the murder of your loved ones that gave you strength to go on. Imagine that a great evil could be turned to greater good." He gestures behind him, at the coffins and the writing on the walls. "I see such a thing here, yes. You both.. you will die someday. And those you love most. Until then.. let's do whatever we must, to make them smile."

Zul'Houngan chuckles at the Forsaken. "We all do what we must, eh?" He says, staring off into space for a bit. He shakes his head, and comes back a bit, wandering back over to the center of the room with the coffins. "What do day say, anyway?"

Those are hardly the most comforting words for Alea. She has a lot of things she could say to Ezra, but in this dark place she stays rather quiet. "Is there anything else of use here?"

"Shapeshifting, yess. The transssmutation of thiss." Ezra holds up a bandaged hand. "Dead flesh, infused by the arcane.. the most malleable of things.." He seems to croon, sounding almost like a daydreaming child. "Have you seen the wonders of necrosurgery? Have you seen the creatures that roam the Plaguelands? The million unique horrors that test the Bulwark of Tirisfal? Far greater variety than living man can attain.."

Most of the other doors are blocked by fallen rubble, or simply no longer exist after the earth crushed it out of existence. There is one other room, mostly intact, off to the left of the main chamber. It seems to contain three intact coffins, much like the ones in the main hall - but they are open, and empty even of dust. Two of the coffins contain no runes at all around their edges; the third has its runes partially carved, and the rusted heads of a hammer and chisel rest next to the third coffin, as if the sculptor/necromancer had stepped out for a break and will be back any millenium now. Though if he does, he'd better bring back fresh handles. In any case, exploring the rest of the old Burning Legion facility will require many men or dwarves and engineering equipment.

Zul'Houngan shakes his head blankly. He has no experience of such things, looking at the Forsaken blankly.

"Ye found _what_?" says the dwarf in shock and horror, as the Horde expedition returns. Nearby, one of the Theramore priests seems to be taking an interest in the conversation.

Ezra calmly explains. "Necromantic lore from the Burning Legion, yess. One sss... sssurvivor, I suppose. Crypts. Spell fragmentss.."

"I'm not sure it qualifies as a survivor anymore," notes Alea. She is much relieved to be away from that place, and her wolf as well. She has this sinking feeling the dwarves will want them all to go back, though.

"What's the Legion doin' all the way down here?" asks the dwarf, looking briefly confused, before deciding the point is irrelevant. "Never mind. We gotta destroy it." He turns to gather together some men. "I'll need some of ya priests too ta help cleanse the place too, I'm thinkin'."

"There'ss much to learn here. We must record knowledge.. even if you destroy what you find," insists Ezra. "Is that not why we are here?"

Zul'Houngan blinks. "Seemed pretty destroyed when we left..." He begins, and looks around. "I don't think anything's coming out again."

The dwarf regards Ezra dubiously. "Easy fer _you_ ta say, mage," he says. "_I_ say there's some things man weren't meant ta know."

"Such as what the Burning Legion are doing here," suggests Ezra off-handedly. "Such as what.. influence.. they may have had on.. what happened here, hmm? But you're right. Best.. not to know."

Zul'Houngan grunts and shrugs. In Zul's opinion pretty much everything man was not meant to know can only really be known once, thankfully.

"Well, we'd best have ye along anyhow. Seein' as ye're some kind of an expert on this sorta thing. But ye best not get in the way," says the foreman, as he goes to gather up an impromptu demolition and purification team.

Alea'sha sighs softly and looks down at her wolf. The wolf peers up at her. Though no words are exchanged, the animal's growling grumble speaks volumes, and is mirrored in another sigh from the the druid. "Very well.."

Fortunately for Ezra's academic desires, there isn't much to be found in the remainder of the Burning Legion outpost. The Legion is not much given to writing down military secrets in cleartext on their walls, and little enough of the magical writing in the newly cleared rooms is distinct from what Ezra was able to copy down into his notebook.

The brief spark of unlife that startled the Horde adventurers was also the most intact of the tomb's guardians; all other signs of magic and necromancy have long since fled. Ezra is able to pocket a handful of the dust, if he wishes, while the priests are busily invoking the Holy Light to purify the jars along the walls. There is little else in the rooms worth keeping.

In a few hours, the priests claim to be done. "There was little for us to do," they say to the foreman. "The earth has almost reclaimed this place already, and the Light has done much to purge the Legion's taint from what is left." The dwarf nods, and turns to a trio of gnomes holding a profusion of wires and cylinders painted in danger-red. "Over to you lads, then."

Zul'Houngan looks to his companions, "Perhaps we should, leave before they go to work?" Zul doesn't really want to be in when the gnomes cause a catastrophic cave-in.

The demolitionists swarm in with their surveying equipment and their abacuses and their own little tools, inspecting the walls and floors in their own way and planting dynamite in crucial niches. "All right, everyone," they say as they come out. "We'd probably best get well back from this tunnel before we blow it, just to be safe."

"That does seem quite wise," agrees the high elf. She looks to the troll and asks quietly, "Why if they've purified this place are they so keen about blowing it up, anyway?"

"All righty, then," say the gnomes in unison. The foreman gestures to the rest of the expedition, who fall in behind him smartly. And as soon as they turn the corner and the gnomes are out of sight, the foreman breaks into a run.

Zul'Houngan runs after the Foreman, and turns to Alea. "I think if you tell the gnomes they're going to blow somethig up, and they don't get to, they might just find something to blow up. Works that way with goblins, anyway."

---

Ten minutes later, the gnomes turn up, looking blackened and dust-laden, but happy. "The chamber's sealed up, just as you requested. And... uh, some of the adjoining tunnels, too," says the lead demolitionist, before falling over. The foreman breathes a sigh of relief. "Glad ye lads are all right," he says. "And glad that accursed place is sealed up for good... and its secrets buried with it."

Ezra says nothing. He doesn't even pat the notebook resting in his jacket pocket. No need to show too much satisfaction. But they'll learn, all of them.
