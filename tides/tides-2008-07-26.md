For several miles, the journey is uneventful. There are signs of Ashenvale's abundant wildlife among the trees, but it quickly vanishes into the woods as the travelers approach, and only because of Saeren's keen senses does anyone know they were there.

Not long after crossing the Falfarren River, though, things get quieter. The wildlife gets more and more scarce, as if they were more than unusually frightened of something, or driven off.

In the early afternoon, Saeren spots movement along the south side of the road. At first, it just looks like another bear, but a second glance shows that it is moving on two legs, and making a concerted, if failed, effort not to be seen. A furbolg.

Saeren looks at the almost-hidden enemy with a touch of amusement. Being on the road, it has to see her, thus its attempt to hide, and therefore there's no point in messing about. She doesn't have to reach for an arrow, but just draw taught the string where she has fitted one already. As she lets the first shot fly at the enemy she calls back calmly, "Furbolg near the road!"

The shot goes wide, but Saeren isn't worried. Not yet. She has given her friends warning, and while the enemy might evade her darts, the real danger that threatens the furbolg has yet to be brought to bear.

Ezra hurries toward Saeren, mindful of the sentinel's keen senses and the risks - both natural and political - of traveling in these woods. He glances about as he scuttles forward. Danger could be lurking on every side.

With Saeren's attack, the furbolg's friends decide that the ambush has been sprung. Five more furbolgs emerge from the undergrowth beside the road and charge forward, one lagging behind the others and waving a carved wooden stick while chanting in a guttural, growling tongue.

Nerai, waiting in the cockpit of Eecee for some work of trouble. When it inevitably comes from Saeren, Nerai pushes the go button. Well, she doesn't quite have the go button worked out, so she needs to hold down the throttle, open the breather, tip the tube up just a bit, THEN press the go button. But it's basically the same, right? In any case, Nerai guides Eecee in the direction of the upcoming melee.

As Nerai's mechanical contraption clatters down the road, the furbolg Saeren had first spotted brings its huge shaggy arm around three times in a strange gesture. Only Saeren's keen vision is sharp enough to discern the stone that was hurled from the creature's sling as it sails across the road and lands in the underbrush on the other side.

Finally, Kagarn Stormhoof leaps from the cart and rushes into battle as well. As he does so, he raises his own totem, uttering a chant in mystic Taur'ahe, and his allies are filled with the courage of the spirits.

Saeren moves forward a few steps, knowing well her range. Her bow sings again, this time the shot flies far more true, tearing into the flesh of the nearest furbolg, then bursting into flame. The creature wavers a moment, wounded badly, but still determined to attack, it does not fall.

The Forsaken wizard draws his crooked fingers together and wheezes out an incantation in a cold, merciless voice. Winter has come to Ashenvale, and slashing shards of ice begin whirling about in a cone around the furbolgs.

Caught between fire and ice, one of the furbolgs collapses to the turf, Ezra's ice storm still pounding its motionless form. The others, howling with rage, bull their way through the blizzard and continue their advance.

Nerai's leg kicks expertly to one side, as Nerai activates Eecee's run mode. She runs past her companions to get up front, hopefully take some of the brunt of the oncoming attacks. She ends up toe to toe with one of the furbolg.

The remaining furbolg emerges from Ezra's spell and slings a rock at Nerai's war machine. The stone clangs against the armor of Eecee, bruising the goblin slightly - and Ezra realizes that the might of the stone's throw was augmented by the magic invoked by its ally.

Kagarn rushes forward, drawing his quarterstaff as he goes. He moves as fast as he can without compromising his defense, eyeing the furbolg shaman warily.

Saeren changes her aim, honing-in on the shaman. She again fires true, striking her enemy, burning and wounding. Again, the creature is able to withstand the force of the attack.

As Ezra's wizened hands begin to shape another spell, the furbolg shaman points its totem at the undead mage and barks a single word. Ezra feels the very ground seem to shift beneath him, and he feels a heavy blow strike him on the chest from an unseen spirit; the magic Ezra had begun to shape flares and dissipates harmlessly into the air.

The furbolgs circle around Eecee, giving the mechanical contraption a wide berth before converging on Nerai and flailing angrily at her armor, but none of their attacks manage to do more than glance off the machine's iron hide.

Nerai winds up the morning-star on Eecee's left sides, and buries the spiked ball into the shoulder of the furbolg she's facing. A quick twist on a control knob pulls the ball back, taking with it a significant chunk of furbolg flesh. She gives out a little cheer. This is the way she knows how to fight.

Kagarn sizes up the furbolg caster, glances at Ezra with a grin, and raises his staff, pointing it at the enemy shaman and beginning to chant. He too rocks with a blow from the earth, but his own spell was simpler, and his chanting continues unabated. The forest lights up with a burst of lightning that arcs from Kagarn's staff and singes the furbolg's flank as it dives to the earth.

As the furbolg totemic recovers from the near-hit from Kagarn, the final furbolg runs forward and slings another rock at Eecee, making another resounding clang and putting another sizable dent in the machine.

"Bye," says the elf. Again Saeren's bow screams in the battle and once more she strikes true. The blast settles an arrow right into the furbolg's ear and nearly out the other side. While it does clear out any wax, the resounding rush of flame also turns the flesh of the furbolg's brain into ash. The shaman dies due to this unacceptable condition.

The unhappy undead unleashes another bolt of eldritch fire, this time at the furbolg lurking near the back. It howls in pain and crumples over, leaving Ezra to brush his hands together and crack the bones of his neck in satisfaction.

The surviving furbolgs redouble their efforts, howling in despair and rage as their talons rake the iron hide of Eecee, ripping fresh gouges in the metal.

"Leave one alive!" Ezra croaks from behind the goblin.

Nerai turns and swings the iron ball at the furbolg at her side, but an errant shift of one of the control levers sends the spiked ball clattering off of one shield.

Kagarn strides forward. "Just one will do, right?" he cries out, chanting and swinging his rune-carved staff around. A ruddy ball of fire launches from his staff and smacks solidly into one of the furbolgs clustered around Eecee; it falls sideways and hits the ground with a solid thud, its charred corpse still burning.

"One lives that will not resist us," answers Ezra, pointing to the wounded furbolg.

Right after slaying the shaman the night elf draws an arrow for another shot. Her first target, the enemy archer, is just back in her sight when reduced to a pyrotechnic spectacle. Without comment her attention shifts to the next, and just as she draws the arrow to her cheek that one is aflame. Finally Saeren turns swiftly and fires away, missing with a grumble.

Ezra administers the Forsaken equivalent of triage - the healthy must die, while the wounded can be coerced and controlled. Another firebolt ignites the remaining active furbolg, sending the smell of charred flesh and burning fur through the forest.

Only one furbolg remains, and it staggers away from Eecee and turns away, limping as it attempts to make its retreat.

Nerai steps after our new friend. She pops her morning star against it's back as it's walking away, dropping the furbolg into the ground. Nerai shrieks a bit, "Er... I hope that wasn't too hard..."

"I didn't feel a thing," assures Saeren.

---

As Saeren binds the surviving furbolg securely, Kagarn tends its wounds. "That shaman..." says the tauren. "He was not in harmony with the spirits. He coerced them, forced them to do his bidding. He did not show them proper respect as he commanded them." He mumbles a healing spell, and the furbolg's bruises begin to fade. "This is strange. The furbolgs were once _part_ of nature, moving with its rhythms."

"They apparently move their own way," says Saeren.

Kagarn shakes his head. "If they move with the rhythms of the world, they are also affected by them. If the earth is tainted and corrupt, they too will begin to show the signs."

Ezra perks up at this. "Oh? Well, now... we've been chassing a source of corruption ourselvesss.. Perhaps causssed by something similar." He examines the furbolg carefully, squatting down in front of the creature and eyeing it.

"So much is withering and being twisted," whispers Saeren.

Nerai has walked Eecee back to the wagon, and wandered back in this time. SHe looks ovr. "Sometimes a broken linkage is just a broken linkage.. but sometimes your gas distiller is jammed."

The most obvious sign is not there; the furbolg's throat, like that of its departed companions, is devoid of any trace of gills. However, all of them have patches of missing hair, even where it was not charred off by the party's magic, and on those patches, the skin is dry and flaking.

When Saeren nods, indicating that the creature is adequately restrained, Kagarn holds up his staff and begins to chant. A soft, warm green light envelops the creature, and its eyes flicker open. It roars, seeming angry, and struggles at its bonds.

Ezra casts a spell of his own. And now, squatted in front of the squirming ursinoid, his mouth utters the harsh and foreign grunts and noises of the furbolg language. "Why did you attack us?" he asks.

The bear-man breaks off its struggles and glares angrily at Ezra. "Need to survive. Need to eat," it snaps.

"Many creatures can be eaten that don't throw fire," points out the wizard. "What about the deer, or the foxes? Or other things?"

"Must defend ourselves," growls the creature sullenly. "No fish in our lake. We move on. We keep enemies away." He looks around at his fallen comrades, and his shoulders slump. "But you... you as deadly as ones at lake."

"What ones at the lake? Where is the lake?" Ezra asks. "Small, scaly?" Ezra does his best to imitate the murlocs' characteristic warbling noise.

The creature jumps, its eyes snapping wide, and it looks at Ezra with cold fear. "You know them? You _with_ them? Fish-men and snake-women! Death to them!" It struggles at its bonds again.

"We are sent to destroy them," says Ezra. He nods at Saeren. "Have you seen dead fish and snakes? Arrows in them, with burn marks? That is her handiwork."

"To think that these should have been our friends," says Saeren softly. "I've wasted arrows today."

"Snake-women use arrows," says the furbolg angrily. It looks at Ezra. "You lie! You with them!"

"You use spells of the spirits, of nature. So does this tauren." Ezra points at Kagarn. "Are we with you?"

That gives the creature pause. It stops struggling against its bonds, but looks away. "We no trust you. No trust outsiders. Not even ones like her," it says, looking up at Saeren.

"I don't ask to sit at your fire and eat your food," replies Ezra calmly. "Show us where the fish and snake people are at the lake. We will destroy them. In return, you will leave the road alone, and enjoy the fish again. Will you do this?"

Saeren feels a little thrill of excitement go through her. "I could just follow their trail back to the naga, too." She hopes there are a lot of enemies.

The furbolg mutters, "No promise." It looks to the south, longingly. "Want to go home."

Ezra examines the missing fur and ill-kept skin of the creature. "Did they do these things to you?" he asks, pointing out sections of flesh.

"No," says the furbolg shortly. "Got sick after leave home. Not good to leave home."

"It's from moving away from their home," says Saeren. "If he gets back, or if they can become established in a new place they will be okay." She frowns. "Whatever they are, they deserve to have their land back, and I want to help them whether they would help us or not."

"Where was your home?" Ezra asks, again facing the furbolg.

"That way," says the furbolg, looking to the south again. "By big big lake. Near big wood huts of furless people." He glances at Saeren with that last.

"And the snake and fish folk drove you out?"

"Yes," says the furbolg.

Ezra rises to his feet. "Very well. We will drive them away from the lake and destroy them. You will have no reason to stay away from the lake then. You will be home, and have food, and be safe. No promise. It's just natural, yess?"

The furbolg simply shrugs, glancing around at its captors one last time, before looking at the ground in front of it.

"You have dead here. How are they treated by your people?" Ezra asks. "Not left out for the birds, surely. Tell us how to honor them."

"Mystral Lake," says Saeren. "Silverwind Refuge is there, as well." She looks at Ezra, then to the Tauren. "I wonder if they are moving against my people again." Her eyes narrow to slits, "This time I will leave their dead dangling from sticks."

"Bury in ground," says the furbolg, answering Ezra's question. "Shaman asks earth spirit watch them." It looks at the fallen furbolg shaman.

Kagarn steps forward, as this is translated. "I do not know their rites," he says, "but I can speak with the earth spirits on behalf of their souls. Tell him this."

"The tauren speaks to the same spirits," Ezra relays. "We bury them and he speaks his prayers. Or we take them to your shaman. Choose."

"If can bury at our home," says the furbolg. "Only those spirits know us."

The mage nods slowly. "Let's gather them up," he directs to the others, pointing at the corpses. "We'll visit Silverwind Refuge and warn them as well."

Nerai busies herself about this task. There's plenty of room in the carts, after all.

As the party travels south, the furbolgs safely stowed on the wagon, the skies above darken. Soon it begins to rain, and then to thunder. The furbolg looks up into the sky as the rain begins to fall, and then turns its face away, spitting; and no wonder, for there is a faint unpleasant odor to the water that falls from the sky.

Kagarn wrinkles his own brow, putting into Common what the furbolg can only express in his guttural language. "This rain is not natural," he says. "From all the tales, the rains of Ashenvale are pure and clean." He looks to the south, where lightning streaks the sky. "I wonder..."

Seeing so many tracks, even Saeren has to pause. "We're rather outnumbered," she explains. "Badly. I've dealt with groups of this size rarely, but I've never stuck around for a pitched battle before."

"We'll take our friend to his tribe first," says Ezra. "Perhapss the Refuge will lend some of itss forces, hmm?"

Just then, there is a loud crack of thunder and a flash of lightning to the south. They are now close enough to see Silverwind Refuge, far in the distance... and they see that the lightning stroke very nearly hit the night elf encampment before earthing itself in the ground nearby.

Nerai points ahead... "That... doesn't exactly seem natural...."

"I do not know. We need to go wide. I will risk going closer," says Saeren. "If I do not rejoin you, well.. you'll figure something out."

"We will convey your respects to the naga," says Ezra, sardonically.

"I'd appreciate that," murmurs Saeren. Then she is off, getting her better look.

There are a few close calls with naga or murloc patrols, but eventually Saeren manages to make her way almost to the very threshold of Silverwind Refuge. As she lurks behind a tree, another stroke of lightning dashes itself not thirty yards away, leaving a distinct smell of ozone. From her vantage point she can see four sentinels peering out intently into the woods, staying under cover of the roof, though even their sharp eyes haven't spotted Saeren yet.

Saeren sees her people clearly in the lightning, and hopes they are still free. She fits an arrow to the string with a note tied to it. She has no time for a long story, just three words must do. "Naga, murlocs, many." She fires, waiting for her people to see her, and then will fade back into the darkness. She will not be leaving the battle for long, but she must quickly reach her friends and launch an attack on the enemy.

The sentinels snap into action as the arrow thuds into the woodwork. Three of them dive behind the doorjambs, aiming their bows into the forest, while the fourth reads the note. It's hard to read her expression, but she seems angry. "Don't you think we know that!" she yells into the forest. "If you are one of us, come out!"

Saeren will give no reply. She is already moving. They will know when she is back. She only hopes that she has enough firepower with her friends.

Upon finding her friends, the vengeful night elf wastes little time. "My people are under siege," says Saeren. "The naga and murloc are great in number, and might be enough to overwhelm the elves. I suggest an assault on their rear. The enemy won't expect it, but we must move quickly. I have no fancy tactics for this one. I have no time. We move back, find them, and blow apart the back of their line."

Nerai looks between her companions with trepidation. Are we really going to try and do this? She looks out at the horizon around them. For the first time the magnitude of what this is hits her.

"Ask the furbolg how many of his people are still alive," adds Saeren. "We could use a change in this rather difficult situation."

"That would require magic I'd rather conserve for the battle," Ezra murmurs. But he isn't without options.

Ezra approaches the still-bound furbolg. In the fertile soil of Ashenvale's ground, he draws three pictures. The first is a stick figure with visibly pointed ears. The second is a stick figure with a visible snake's tail. And the third is a hunched-over stick figure with claws. With his cane he begins making scratch marks, hashing out the number of night elves he guesses to be here in the Refuge. And beneath the naga figure, he hashes out two dozen. Then he taps the spot beneath the furbolg picture, and looks at the creature.

The furbolg growls out a reply, and shakes its head. It tugs slightly on its bonds, not making a serious attempt to get free, but since it hadn't been struggling for some time, this is still a gesture of sorts.

Saeren reaches for the bonds and starts to remove them. "If we are going to risk our lives I want him free to have a fair chance at survival. I won't trap him for the enemy."

Ezra nods and shrugs. He withdraws his traveling knife, plunging it into the dirt through the head of the naga figure, and stares at the furbolg.

Nerai will watch. She honestly expects the furbolg to run when it's let go.

The furbolg, freed, raises its arms and roars ferociously, glaring at everyone in turn. When no one makes any hostile gestures toward it, it stares at Ezra's drawing, then begins to scratch in the dirt. It makes eighteen tally marks beneath the furbolg drawing, then wipes out five of them with its paw, glaring at Ezra.

"We'll leave it to him to get his people, or to sit by," says Saeren. "Our work remains before us. Let's see it done." She sighs and stares off towards the lake, "It's going to be ugly."

"We must return these bodies to his people," points out Ezra. "And he will want to fight too." He pulls out the knife and flips it in his hand, handle outward, and offers it to the furbolg, pointing at the naga drawing with his other.

"If we live to do so," says Saeren.

The furbolg stares at the knife, then glances at the cart where its fallen brethren remain. It seems to think for a moment, then takes the knife and runs off to the west.

Saeren watches the enemy leave with a smile. "He's wise to get out of here." She turns back to her task and stretches her fingers. "We'll have to be careful, but we can do this. We just have to give the defenders a lot of help, not win it all on our own."

As she speaks, the night elf thinks of all the times she's faced groups of ten or fifteen naga. It's different this time, though. She can't just hit and run. This time she has to stand and fight and kill until she is dead or her enemies are destroyed. Saeren murmurs her words again, only this time they sound almost like a prayer, "We can do this."
