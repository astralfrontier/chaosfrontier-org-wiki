As the travelers make their way to Astranaar, Saeren notices that they are being followed - by night elves. Every so often, she spots a violet-hued face in the distance, which quickly ducks back under cover when her eyes pass over them. They seem to be keeping their distance, but they aren't going away either. And the sightings become more frequent as they draw nearer to the elven city.

Astranaar itself is on an island in the center of a natural lake. Wooden buildings are everywhere, seeming almost as if they were still living wood. As the travelers reach the nearest bridge, they are stopped by six sentinels, glaring at the party with their glowing eyes. One of them even has her bow drawn, and is tracking Ezra. The nearest steps forward, addressing Saeren. "Who are you, and what is your business here?" she demands.

"I'm Saeren, and unless incompetence is the rule of the day, you already know what we're here for," answers the archer. "At least I hope not every hunter was devoted to skulking on our tracks instead of running ahead."

The sentinel bridles. "I assure you, Saeren Finblighter, you would be receiving a heroes' welcome here... were it not for you bringing _them_ here." She gestures to the Forsaken and the goblin sitting on the wagon. "A goblin is bad enough... but a _zombie_? After all their kind has done to our people at Maestra's Post? We have lost over a dozen this week alone - seven dead and five... captured."

Saeren smiles, a somewhat unsettling gesture. "I rather prefer this welcome. It is far more sincere." She looks to Ezra and says, "He hasn't tried to kill me yet, and if not for him we'd have a lot more dead on our hands. It may not be.. comfortable, but we must look beyond such designations as forsaken and goblin when the entire world is at stake."

"The entire world is _always_ at stake," says the sentinel sourly. "Nevertheless... we will be watching you. All of you," she adds, finally looking over the rest of the party. At a signal, the three sentinels step aside, clearing the bridge, and the elf that had been tracking Ezra lowers her bow, though her knuckles are pale as they grip the wood.

Ezra says nothing, preferring to follow Saeren through the place where her people dwell.

"True enough," says Saeren. "Now all we have to do is act on that notion." She will lead the way, apparently caring very little about being watched, and even less about ruffling feathers with hard words. "I hope you can achieve what we must achieve quickly here. Though I have never been there, I think I might be more comfortable visiting the home of your people than my own."

Kagarn rumbles, "You must be patient with them, Saeren. They have lost friends and loved ones, and they have learned ample reasons to mistrust the Forsaken."

"We don't have time for patience, Kagarn," says Saeren. "I haven't any left, anyway. I only hope to not infuriate everyone to the point where it threatens our purpose here." She looks to the Shaman and sighs, "I will try to contain my annoyance as best I can. For the sake of my people." The effort of speaking so much is clearly taking its toll on her nearly nonexistant patience.

A messenger joins the group. "Saeren Finblighter?" she asks. "Sentinel Farsong wishes to speak with you. This way." She leads in the direction of one of the larger buildings.

Farsong is waiting upstairs, standing over a table which contains a map of Maestra's Post and its environs. Wooden figures are scattered around it - a cluster of zombie figurines to the north, various serpentine naga figurines elsewhere, and a collection of elf figures at Maestra itself. "Welcome," she says. "I understand we have you - _and_ your friends - to thank for the fact that Silverwind has not fallen to the naga." She seems almost friendly; certainly in contrast to the attitude on display from her subordinates.

"We understand that we've got another problem to deal with, as well," says Saeren. She actually sounds polite for a change. Maybe she really is trying. She looks down at the figures and frowns in thought.

Farsong nods and gestures to the map. "You are correct. So far they have been content to tangle with our scouting parties, but we are concerned about what they are up to. The Forsaken in particular seem to be interested in taking prisoners." She shakes her head. "And as if that weren't enough..."

The sentinel commander places a small handful of orc figurines near the road to Maestra. "We have had reports of attacks on travelers, here. They don't wear the Horde insignia, although we've yet to capture one to be sure. We _do_ know that they consort with demons."

"This is beginning to be far more than mere coincidence," says Saeren. "I wonder if they have found some elves they could sucker into attacking orcs while they were at it." She narrows her eyes, "It's far too convenient, don't you think?"

Farsong says, "I do not know. What I do know is that this logo was seen among them." She places a small charcoal sketch on the table, of a thong-wrapped hammer above a stylized crown. "Do any of you recognize this?"

"The Twilight'sss Hammer," croaks Ezra. It is the first thing he's said aloud since entering Astranaar. "Thesse orcs would be sslain on ssight by the Horde. They conssort with dark powers - such as those we have been fighting, yess."

"All of our enemies are consorting, then?" asks Saeren.

Farsong looks up at Ezra. "Indeed?" she says. "We had thought the Twilight's Hammer clan dead in the second war. By the hand of the rest of the orcs, as it happens. Though we have only heard about this from the humans; supposedly the Twilight's Hammer was destroyed long before their race came to Kalimdor's shores."

"The Twilight's Hammer bargains with the powerss of the Old Gods, yess. One of those iss backing the naga and the murlocss. There are... renegade Forsaken who have alsso fallen to the dark promisess of the naga." The scarred sorcerer shrugs. "There iss no destroying such a power forever. Always there will be those called to what it offerss."

Saeren looks to Kagarn for a moment, then back to the statues. "So the question is.. who do we destroy first? They seem divided right now. It would seem prudent to crush them before they get a chance to grow more organized. Exactly as they mean to do to us."

"We haven't been able to identify the naga's base of operations," says Farsong. "They have been spotted only in small patrols. We are guessing that they are based closer to the shore, but going there in force risks opening conflict with the Horde outpost at Zoram'gar." She taps the map near the Forsaken cluster. "And we have been reluctant to engage these for the same reason. We have sent a messenger to Zoram'gar with evidence that the Forsaken have been attacking our people, but she has yet to return."

Kagarn speaks up. "The Earthen Ring is held in high esteem in Zoram'gar. If you can give your word that you will act only against the naga, I can speak on your behalf." He glares at the orc figures. "If the Twilight's Hammer is indeed operating in these parts, we of the Earthen Ring may have our own business with them." His giant fist tightens around the totem he carries.

Ezra speaks again. "The naga are your real enemy. The Forsaken will .. repent of their ways, leave that to me, yesss." He points a withered claw at the figurines. "The Twilight's Hammer, I am ssure, have alsso been promised great thingss by the naga. I doubt that they have direct contact with their would-be masster."

"Then it seems our course of action is clear for the moment," says Saeren.

Farsong looks at Ezra, more curiously than suspiciously. "I'm sure my fellow elves have expressed their suspicions to you, sir. If I were to _tell_ them that I was leaving the problem of the Forsaken to you, I would have a near-mutiny on my hands. Why are you so certain that you can turn them around?"

"Because the Undercity already knows of their .... faithlessness." Ezra smiles toothsomely. "You night elvess... you underesstimate Sylvanas Windrunner, yes. And if they do not listen to reasson, well...we will do it Saeren's way."

"I love doing it my way," says Saeren.

This raises one of Farsong's impressive eyebrows. "You say that the Forsaken here are operating without the sanction of even their Dark Lady? Interesting..." She rubs her chin. "The Third War taught us to regard zombies as a single-minded force, all operating in grim unison. It seems that your people are anything but."

Farsong finally nods. "Then I suppose your road takes you next to Maestra's Post, and then beyond. If you can get word to Zoram'gar, we can move in force against the naga." She looks at Ezra squarely. "And against the Forsaken as well, if they prove recalcitrant."
