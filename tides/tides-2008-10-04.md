Matters are tense at Maestra's Post. The Horde, once perhaps believed by the night elves to be a monstrous monolith, has been revealed to have internal factions and conflicts of its own. More than once, Saeren overhears whispered conversations in Darnassian about how the sentinels might somehow drive a wedge between the Forsaken and Durotar, or exploit some other weakness.

James, the traitor - or loyalist? - who stabbed his superior in the Forsaken camp, has brought a few of his fellows back. Now these undead are being watched closely. Their loyalty isn't to the night elves, despite the fact that their alchemical skill cured several of the captives. It wasn't to the Horde, not strong enough anyway. And now the elves are examining their other enemies: the remaining naga-allied Forsaken, the Twilight's Hammer, and of course the naga themselves.

More and more, the enchanted forests of Ashenvale come under assault. The demonic despoilers of the forest change their faces and names but never change their goals, the night elves grumble amongst themselves.

For a time after James came to the camp, Ezra isolated himself even more tightly than the elves thought fitting. Now it seems he's come out of his seclusion. He speaks to Delgren and to Orendil Broadleaf, and he walks around the perimeter of the outpost with Kagarn.

Saeren is doing her best to avoid the elves. The best place to do so seems to be where there are forsaken. "So what are you looking for?" she asks of Ezra and Kagarn.

It is the massive Tauren that answers; the wizard stays silent. "Ezra has been asking me about ancestor spirits," he explains. "Why the races of the Horde revere their ancestors, while for the most part the Alliance seems not to. Could it be that the humans don't have ancestral spirits, for example. He told me of the excavation at Bael Modan, and what the dwarves hoped to find. He told me too of what he and his companions did find."

Saeren listens to what is said, but for some reason thinks little of the topic. "My people have enough trouble looking at the world in front of them without thinking a great deal about their ancestors. At times I wonder what it is we revere."

Kagarn shakes his head disapprovingly; his shaggy mane tosses back and forth, and his nostrils flare in a quick snort. "Please understand that even the kaldorei must honor those that came before them," he replies. "If you forget your past, if you forget those who gave you life and built up that which you treasure, you will lose all meaning in your lives."

"For them there may be hope," says Saeren. "They are still recovering, having lost so much it takes time." She sighs softly and looks out into the wood, "Time seems to not be on our side, however."

Kagarn shakes his mane again. "Please do not say 'them'. Even now there are those who wish you to be part of their family and their kin."

Saeren looks evenly at Kagarn, her eyes slowly shifting over his features before looking away again. "I do not feel right here. My place is out in the wilds. Here I do not know what my purpose is."

The shaman's eyes focus on Saeren's in return, and inky-black wells regard radiant white orbs. "I too feel more at home in nature," the shaman says. "But I think I am finding a purpose, even among the kaldorei. The naga must be stopped. The Earthen Ring must - _must_ - do something about the Twilight's Hammer cult. Therefore my place is here."

"And my place is here, as well. But only for now," says Saeren. "The naga have become too important for my hunting alone."

The shaman grins widely, showing off his flat teeth. "Yes. Your name has been spoken here several times. You could find a place here, not only as hunter, but as leader of the war."

"I'm not sure that is wise," says Saeren. "Leaders need a better grasp of life than I do, and perhaps less familiarity with death, as well." Still, she smiles, "If they really need me to be successful, I will not abandon them."

Ezra has formerly been silent. Now he speaks. "You sspeak the words of Sylvanass Windrunner. A ranger, yess. A victim of war. A leader of her people. A ruler granted resspect and honorss. Conssider her example."

"I do not think I can achieve great things," says Saeren. "In the end, wiser minds than mine must solve this issue. Even I am smart enough to doubt this is a test that can be passed on the strength of our warriors alone."

Ezra shrugs. But Kagarn laughs. "You need not be the supreme leader of such an effort. Look around you, sentinel. The trees grow in the earth, nourished by the soil. The wind blows their seeds far. Fire consumes dead wood. Rain gives the trees their vitality. The elements work together in harmony. You may not be a master strategist. But you can and should be a leader in your own way."

"And what of you two?" asks Saeren. "What do you think we have to do to win? How do you deal with something like the enemy we face?"

Kagarn gestures west. "Near the coast is Zoram'gar. The Earthen Ring will need to know what I have seen, and they will give me further guidance." He glances at Ezra, as though he himself were not sure of the wizard's intent.

Ezra laughs unwholesomely. "_My_ role is simple. Destroy that which opposes uss, yes. Ssupport my allies through arcane magic.. however unpleasant that notion may be to the night elvess. It is a force they do not comprehend, but one which can be useful."

"If it kills the naga it can't be all bad," answers Saeren. "As long as there is something to shoot I'll have a purpose left, and if nothing else, the world has hardly provided a shortage of enemies."

Kagarn laughs softly. "As you wish. But you are better known in these forests than perhaps you realize. That, too, can be a weapon against the naga. Don't neglect it." He turns, seemingly intent on leaving the other two alone.

Saeren looks to Ezra, "I'm not sure why everyone is interested in improving my life all of the sudden."

Ezra eyes Kagarn's retreating back. "He iss who he iss, I ssuppose. I for one feel ssorry for your loss - for the loss all of you have ssuffered. But resolving it is your business, yes."

"I appreciate you not trying to push me," says Saeren. "My people and I will find our way through. There is little choice in the matter, is there?"

The wizard shrugs. "That iss the Forsaken way, yess. Fight, regardless of the odds against you. Take any advantage you can find. Do what you musst, however cold it might be."

"What do you think is happening with your people?" asks Saeren. "The elves are wondering if you are going to break away from the Horde.. or be thrown out after this recent twist."

Ezra laughs aloud; the sound startles a pair of nesting birds nearby, who fly squawking in fright away from their tree branch. "Yess. Everyone wonders if the Forssaken will break apart from the Horde. The dead are not companionss anyone would choose, after all..." He fingers his cane, and looks up at the sky concealed by a canopy of green. "We have made ourselves... useful to Thrall, yes. Useful to the Horde. We musst continue to be useful. We need strong allies. For we have many, many enemies."

"For what little it is use, you have one less enemy than you used to," says Saeren. "I think I understand your people. At least in a way. You deserve to survive as much as anyone else."

Ezra smiles slowly. "For that I thank you," he murmurs. "Although it may not be true after all..... who can say? We were once sslaves of the Lich King, yess. Ruled by his whisperss. Even now I can hear them. Were we a shade weaker, perhapss we might turn back.... "

"Then it is good you are strong," replies Saeren. "That fight is another matter we must deal with. Another day. First we have to be alive to see it."

The night elf decides to turn the conversation away from battles. "So what is the Undercity like? What do forsaken do when they aren't burning naga to a crisp?"

"Undercity..." Ezra rubs his hands together. "It lies under the ruins of the city of Lordaeron. It is fortified against the Scarlet Crusade and the Scourge both, yes. Its entrances are secret and guarded. Perhapss you think it is a hard thing that the sentinels face here, to fight a guerilla war against a single clan of orcss. The Forssaken face a constant onslaught from the living and from the dead. And within the city, trade happenss after a fashion. It is much like the cities I have seen, except... that the inhabitants are no longer alive. Darker, danker, yess. But sstill vital."

"I wonder what it would be like to see it," says Saeren. "I imagine the reception would be.. cold. Probably even colder than your greeting in our cities."

"The Forssaken are not a trusting people, no," Ezra mutters.

"Perhaps there is hope from this that there might be some cause to trust," replies Saeren.

"We shall ssee, hmm?" Ezra murmurs. "Firsst we musst convince our allies of this. Our enemiess may come later."

The two return to the outpost. What they find there is a heated argument between James and Orendil Broadleaf.

"We cannot spare anyone!" the elf is saying. The Forsaken grimaces. "That is why I am saying that I should go!" The elf shakes his head violently. "They will never let you in! You would be killed as a spy. Think about it, please."

"What is this?" asks Saeren. She never bothers intervening the social space between herself and others. "Who is going where?"

James clams up immediately. Orendil speaks, in harsh, clipped tones. "There is a child that is sick in Astranaar. Her father sent word here. It seems that the Forsaken herbalists to the north, the same ones that .... well, that influenced the naga curse, have also been gathering an herb that would cure the child. It's called Bathran's Hair. Someone must get it to Astanaar. But even an armed party such as yourselves were waylaid by the Twilight's Hammer. The Forsaken cannot go, or they'd be attacked. And you yourselves are too important to spare in what's to come."

"So we weigh our duties against the life of an innocent child?" asks Saeren.

Orendil nods. "It is not a thing of hours, but days, yes," he says carefully. "Anyone we send out in less than an armed party risks attack."

"But some of us may go through a wall without raising an alarm," replies Saeren. "Tell me what it is you need to see done."

The elf shakes his head. "It cannot be you alone. We need you, here, soon. But the herb must get to Astranaar somehow."

Saeren looks to Ezra, "How heavy is this herb?" she wonders aloud.

James holds up a leather pouch. "It is light enough," he explains. "It would not be a burden."

"Could a raven carry it?" asks Saeren.

Ezra smiles. "A raven could... if I had not sacrificed that creature for the greater good."

"Is there no way to claim another?" asks Saeren.

The mage shakes his head. "Not without..... great perssonal cost, no."

"Hm." The night elf stares off in the direction of Astranaar. "I will not allow a child to die. A way must be found."

One of James' associates steps forward. His mouth is damaged, but he can still speak intelligbly. "Youth saith we cannoth go becauth we will be attacketh. If we accepth thath, there'th no objectionth." He takes the satchel from James' hands, then stares at Orendil Broadleaf.

The elf turns this over slowly, looking with an uncertain gaze at the dead creature. "Wait," he says at last. Drawing a dagger, he severs a lock of hair from his own head. He folds it up in a small cloth pouch and seals it shut, then presents it. "Pelturas Whitemoon will know me. If you are assaulted, surrender and tell them the story. But please return here once you are finished.... I think we will need your help as well."

James' allies nod. "We will not betray you, thir," the volunteer says. An anguished expression washes over Orendil's face. Although the message was for the Forsaken leader, it clearly touched a delicate nerve of distrust in the elf too. He, it seems, fears that the Forsaken are trying one last gambit against the elves.

Saeren smiles at this, "The forsaken have not forgotten honor, it seems."

Without further ado, the zombies begin loping off into the forest. Ezra watches them go through bandage-guarded eyes.

"What will be, will be," whispers Saeren. She looks to Ezra, "For the first time in a long time, there is something I want to have faith in. We shall see if it is worth the investment."
