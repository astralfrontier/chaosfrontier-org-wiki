Ezra has done some digging. The Sentinels of Auberdine report sightings of naga to the northeast, along the coast. The site is called the Ruins of Mathystra, along the road past the great river.

The Forsaken mage makes quite a sight. Longcoat and hat black as the grave, stark white bandages, hints of scorched flesh, and a general aura of malaise are a stark contrast to the graceful organic hues of the elves and their township, even considering the small dwarven and gnomish contingent. The small craftsmen are just as uninterested in the wizard as their taller naturalist brethren of the Alliance. But a few folk of all three races have shared what they know.

There are other ruins - that much is evident from the presence of an Explorers' League archaeologist named Hollee. Ezra manages to learn two names: Ameth'aran and Bashal'aran. But that is all.

With these things in mind, the wizard begins sketching a crude map of the Darkshore region. Every so often he'll ask something of one of the friendlier elves - that is, those who don't lay hand to hilt when he approaches. And he consults the Twilight's Hammer tome periodically, constructing sketches of columned temples and stone buildings. "Quarried from the hillss nearby, yes.. Plenty of hunting, if they disspose of that troublesome camp..." His mutterings seem to be hinting at something, but the undead sorcerer's grand design isn't clear yet.

"You ever going to explain the whole to me?" asks Saeren. She's had little to do in the village. Most elves view her with pity or admiration, both emotions hardly leading to conversation with Saeren, who seems even quiter than usual.

The wizard nods absent-mindedly, doodling on parchment with bandaged fingers stained black by ink. "Yess, yess," he murmurs. "The naga cursse. If it is lifted, we may need a place for the Highborne - or whatever they may become - to settle. If they do transsform from fissh creatures, that is. That iss not certain, no. But still... we must plan. So, where would you put them?"

"It is most likely that they would wind up aligning with the Horde," says Saeren, her voice low. "Perhaps something could be built in Azshara? The orcs will be clearing quite a swath there with logging."

"Why the Horde?" Ezra asks. His glowing eyes now focus on Saeren and he ceases his writing. "Why should they ally with any surface dweller? That is what I musst consider."

"If you are right, and they cannot return to the waves, then they will find they are vulnerable," says Saeren. "The bad blood among the elves is too great to overcome easily, so I do not think they will be welcome here. It is the Horde that is known for attracting second chance cases like this."

The wizard nods. "Yess, yess.. there iss something to that," he says at last. "The ruinss here interesst me. The night elvess have no interesst in them, it seems..."

Ezra suddenly cackles. "By those lightss, _you_ should join the Horde," he adds.

"Perhaps," replies Saeren evenly. "But I will not harm my own people, either."

"You do not convince me of that," Ezra replies evenly. "But.. there is a peace for now. Perhapss such a defection would assist in maintaining it, if your fellow elvess feel the same. But... idle speculation, yes. The ruinss. If the Highborne laid claim to them, what would the elves do?"

"It depends on what the Highbourne are like," replies Saeren. "If they use arcane magic it probably will not go well. If they change greatly and become more like Night Elves, it would be possible that it is a peaceful relationship. My belief is that it will not be an easy peace to win. There are thousands of Naga by my reckoning. I don't think they can all live in one city."

Ezra shakes his head. "No. They musst have their own placess to live. Just as the night elvess must. Just as the orcs must. Just.... well. We musst be prepared to help them find it, or they will simply continue their war, yess."

"We cannot plan anything without hearing from them," answers Saeren. "Our guesses are worth little. And we don't even know what happens when we purify them. They may remain creatures of the sea."

"They may," Ezra agrees. "But even when there is no enemy in sight, you certainly recognize the value of carrying arrows. Yes?"

"Of course. And knowing our options ahead of time is wise," says Saeren. "But we may be able to eliminate some of them and open others if we grab a naga."

"Yess, naturally." Ezra smiles. "But there is thiss. Perhapss we cannot uncurse one as readily as we may another. The resultss may not be the same. So... we must have many to know for sure."

"Capturing them is harder than killing," notes Saeren. "I think we can enlist some help here and then start your little experiments." She looks at Ezra intently, "The fate of a race depends on our choices now."

The mage thinks carefully. "We musst devise a way to find those naga who....." He pounds his fist into his palm suddenly. "Yesss. The ruinss."

"Any naga who had ssecond thoughtss about his nature would naturally be curiouss about the Highborne ruinss that already exist," he explains. "Therefore, naga who travel alone, or in small groupss to the ruins, are mosst likely to be of interesst to us. Do you agree?"

"It sounds reasonable. It helps that those are also the ones that are easier to catch," says Saeren.

Ezra thinks more. "And this will take less time than ssending an armed war party all the way to Mathystra - assuming that there _are_ any such curiouss individualss, of course.."

"Even if there aren't any, I want to try," says Saeren. "Perhaps the very act of breaking the curse will change their personalities, as well."

Ezra nods. "Well, then... Perhapss you should stake out the ruinss. You may thus avoid the unpleasant, eh, atmosphere of Auberdine, and sserve a worthy purpose at the same time, yes?"

"It's not Auberdine that is unpleasant," says Saeren. She smirks and nods, "I will go and seek a likely target. You know, there may be a way to bait them with the curiousity you hope to see, as well. I'll leave that exercise to you."

Ezra clasps his fingers together. "I have jusst the thing for that..."

---

The tales of haunting of the ruins of Ameth'Aran are true. Even from a great distance, Saeren's keen eyes note the flitting of ghostly shapes between the tumbled marble pillars, and her equally sharp hearing detects, amongst the howling of the wind, a few snatches of what might almost be ancient Highborne speech.

For the first hour, Saeren sees nothing other than the ghosts of Ameth'Aran - although she does learn, by coming a bit too close at one point, that they do not venture far from their haunts.

In the second hour, however, she has a stroke of luck. Just as she is exploring a new hiding place, she spots a glint of flashing green scales from the northeast. She ducks behind the bole of the tree and peers into the woods. Sure enough, she sees the sinuous motion of a naga female.

The newcomer is wearing chainmail under a tabard painted with a symbol resembling an iconic wave, and bears a trident. She is also moving with great wariness - though her focus is mostly behind her, and Saeren's hiding place, off to the side, gets scant attention.

Saeren watches the target with interest. After some time observing, she decides that this looks like a keeper. As promised, she is going to signal Ezra to join her. The signal is a bow shot, but it is only loosed when Saeren has moved farther away. The dart should be quite close enough for Ezra to hear its landing. Since only one falls, it's an invitation to come carefully forward.

Ezra receives the signal. Quietly as he can, he resumes his accustomed form and musters his magics to conceal the signs of his presence.

It takes a bit of time for the wizard to detect the naga Saeren has found. But he has a plan, and he has two weapons with him. The first is the cleansed chalice. The second is a forbidden secret of the Forsaken, something that has only been discussed in whispers by the followers of Sylvanas. Something that was done and may never be undone.

Consequently the mage begins his casting. Amongst the ruins, then, a voice becomes slowly audible. It is not the whisper of the ghosts of the Highborne who wander, spectral and forgotten, among the ruins of their past glory. Rather, it is a sad memory of the unliving who recall the light of life. In a moment the music is joined by a figure, cloaked in a delicate glowing aura, hands outstretched.

The song is slow and melancholy. It is Ezra's weapon against naga sympathetic to their former lives. It is called the Lament of the Highborne. Whispered rumor is all that exists of it in the Undercity, because to expose a wounded heart would be the Dark Lady's downfall. The secret yet exists because the knowledge of that hidden heart binds certain of the Forsaken ever closer to her.

The naga's reaction is immediate. She rears back, eyes glinting in the gloom of the forest, her whole attention focused on the apparition. She is motionless for a long moment, as if listening intently to the melody. Then, she begins to advance... slowly, carefully... almost reverently. She is no longer even looking back the way she came, much less heeding anything ahead beyond the spectral image before her.

And she is not the only one. The melody is so compelling that even the moaning from the ruins is briefly stilled. The ghosts of Ameth'Aran slow in their forlorn dance, and ghostly heads turn toward the sound - though even now they do not venture from the place that binds their tortured souls.

Soon, the naga is so near to the ghostly image of Ezra's design that it would surely see her. Behind the naga, a small indentation appears on the soil near a tree, as the invisible mage sets the purifying chalice upon the ground.

"Drink, and be reborn," the image whispers, during a lull in the song. Its hands stretch out, indicating the chalice - unnoticed before.

The naga is startled, and looks down at the ground. There is the chalice, appeared as if by magic near her coiled tail. "What-" she asks bewildered, picking up the chalice with one hand. "It is one of our vessels of the will of Dagun," she murmurs, in Nazja. She looks up at the image. "Reborn? What do you mean, spectre of this wood?" she asks, her voice shaded with suspicion.

"It is not. It is the will of the Highborne. It is purity." The image sings. "Please.. end this torment."

"Mine.. and yours."

The naga draws back. "What do you know of my torment?" she hisses. Doubt seems to assail her, though, as she peers into the fluid filling the bowl, and raises it to her face. "It smells... wrong, somehow," she muses, but takes a curious sip... and freezes. "What... what is this? Dagun..."

The naga's hands begin to tremble, but she does not cast it away. "The voice... it... it grows quiet..." There is fear in her voice, and yet longing as well. "What... what do I do? ...Help me..." She seems to be fighting a terrible force as she lifts the vessel to her mouth again.

As if in response to the naga's words, the clouds in the night sky clear for a moment. Even the half moon is bright in the darkened glade, and it shines directly through the trees, seemingly pinning the naga in a gleam of moonlight. "Elune..." whispers the naga, and she downs the chalice in a single gulp.

No sooner do the last drops pass her lips than she throws the chalice and her trident to the ground, and clutches her head, uttering a piercing scream. The ghosts of Ameth'Aran flee back into the ruins as the naga falls to the ground, her serpentine tail thrashing, scattering dead leaves in all directions.

The screaming continues, as if the naga is in agony. "Get out!" she cries. "Get... out!" After several minutes, the thrasing stops. A hand gropes in the fallen leaves for the trident...and even as it does so, the scales begin to fall off, leaving pink skin beneath.

The name of Elune draws Saeren from hiding and the night elf rushes forward, casting a wary glance to the ruins. If the enemy sees this it will be a lot harder to do this trick again. That thought is just a brief flicker, though. Saeren kneels beside the naga, reaching out to touch the hand of the naga. "Are you alright?"

As the naga hauls herself up, using the trident as a prop, scales fall from her upper body and spiral around her in a cloud. The transformation does not seem to touch her lower body or her serpentine tail, but above the waist, her skin loses the cast of an aquatic being and approaches the appearance of the Quel'dorei - the Highborne. She stirs, casting her glowing amber eyes in Saeren's direction; her muscles tense, but she seems too weak to fight. Replying in Nazja, she whispers hoarsely, "Who are you? What has happened to me?"

Appearing out of nowhere is Ezra. He slowly doffs his long black coat, and carefully starts to wrap it around the once-naga. "We will tell you everything," he promises in a whisper.

Even Saeren is surprised when she moves to help the naga stand. "My name is Saeren. He is Ezra. You've been freed. At least that is our hope. What is your name?"

The naga manages to rise to an erect position, perching on her tail as before - though even this seems less like a sea serpent now and more like that of a land-bound lizard. "I am... Asprah," she says. "I am... I _was_ a priestess of the tides. But... I no longer hear Its voice. That chalice..." She looks up at the sky again. "I hear Hers once more. Just as I did, before..."

"You've come back," says Saeren, her voice filled with wonder. The night elf feels a bit of hesitation and resistance inside, but pushes past it. "I am happy to meet you, Asprah."

"How did this happen?" the naga demands, looking back and forth between Saeren and Ezra. "That _was_ one of the Dagun chalices. What has happened to it? What has it done to me?" Her voice has a note of aggressiveness, but her tone is mostly that of bewilderment.

"It was transformed by a Titan," explains Ezra. "It was one of your chalices, yess. Its power has been... altered."

The naga looks at her arm, marveling at the bare skin, and raises her hand to her throat. "No gills. The Tides are lost to me." There is no note of regret in her voice, merely the matter-of-fact observation. She turns to Ezra. "What happens to me now? My people - the naga - would have been suspicious of me if they knew that I came to these ruins at all. They will never accept me like this."

"Now you will find new people who will accept you, yes," says Ezra. "You may begin with uss. And those of your people who shared your.. misgivings, they will also be welcomed in the same way. You musst find your own path in this world. But I promise you will not be alone."

"You are not alone," agrees Saeren. "My people will want to meet you, and I think you will find a path that suits you in time. We all do."

The naga turns. "Where is the Highborne spirit?" she asks. "The one who led me here?"

Ezra smiles. "The image was.. conjured by magic. But the song is 'Lament of the Highborne', and it is all too real. There is a lady who I wish you to meet in time. One who feels your loss very keenly. What you saw was... a memory, I suppose. A fleeting glimpse into her heart. Remember it."

"A devious trick," Asprah says without heat. "And yet, without it, I doubt I would have ever drank from that chalice." She looks down at herself. "You know... I hardly even look like a naga now," she says, running a hand through the auburn hair that now grows from her head.

Ezra nods. "I had expected legs," he confesses. "This is strange magic, yess. But perhaps... you weren't ready for them yet, so it did not give them to you? We will disscover the truth. For now, please let uss escort you to Auberdine."

"You will be safe there," promises Saeren. Even if she has to put a few elves in the infirmary to see to it. "It will be a good place to start figuring out what you want to do next, and what this means."

"The power of the Old Gods is strong," says Asprah. "And I have been under the sway of Dagun for millenia. Perhaps that cannot be cleansed with a simple draught." She allows herself to be led by the other two.

"Your freedom is what really matters," answers Saeren.

"I must think about that," replies Asprah. "I am free of Dagun, and yet I will be a hunted woman. Still, perhaps it is for the best." She laughs - and it is a strange thing to hear. A truly joyful laugh, where her kind had hitherto been known only for a derisive cackling. A small thing, but nevertheless the start of something new.
