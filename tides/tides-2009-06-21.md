When the party returns to Azure Watch, there is a spirited discussion already in progress. A small band of furbolgs is there, gesticulating and speaking in their native tongue, while one of the draenei - or rather, an individual seeming like a bent and withered version of the draenei - is evidently acting as a translator.

"" the head furbolg is saying. "" As Menelaous hears the translation, he frowns and replies in draenic, "_"_

_"" asks the furbolg - a chieftain of sorts, judging from the feathers he wears. ""_

_"We are already at war with them," announces Ezra in a serviceable, but blunt form of the furbolgs' tongue. He raises his cane and strikes at the air for emphasis. "What riding beasts are these?"_

_Nerai, getting this translated, speaks up as she looks on, and realises what's being said, "Maybe you just need a metal riding beast of your own, to fight with you?" She smiles, looking at the Furblogs, mostly._

_The furbolg turns - and reacts with dismayed astonishment. "" yells the chieftain, and he and his companions raise their spears. The chieftain addresses Ezra angrily. ""_

_Nerai mutters, "You know, just once it would be nice is someone were happy to see us."_

_Ezra gestures east with his cane. "From where we came, we fought maddened people of your kind. Not your tribe. You yourselves know of others who are corrupt and evil, yes?"_

_The chieftain maintains his battle-ready stance. "" He gestures to Nerai with the end of his spear._

_Ezra reaches into his pocket. "The furbolg are tied to the land. When its power is abused, they likewise turn evil with it." His hand emerges clutching a fistful of gold coins and extending them for inspection. "These, like the land, have their own power. Used well, they serve good. But this too can corrupt. Many goblins have fallen under their power. Those tribes of goblins are the ones who endanger your tribe. Do you understand?"_

_The furbolg finally lowers his spear, and his tribesmen follow suit. "" He peers closely at Ezra. ""_

_"The things that you say are true," Ezra says neutrally. "What of me?"_

_Saeren looks at Nerai, then back to the furbolg. "It's ironic that I'm the only one of us who is ever popular." She relaxes slightly at the sight of lowered spears, "But I guess I won't have to destroy anyone just yet."_

_Nerai stares at Saeren. "Yes. It is somewhat ironic." She pulls some pliers out of her schmock and starts to fiddle with a gizmo. A twist of the wrench here, and a poke there, and a little mechnical butterfly is made. She holds her hands out,a nd the clockwork unwinds with a little whine, the butterfly flapping it's wings mechanically._

_The furbolg stares at Ezra for a moment longer, then turns to the broken dreaenei. "" Menealous replies, through the translator. ""_

_One of the chieftain's entourage turns, at the sound of whirring clockwork, and gasps. "" he asks, pointing a clawed finger at the mechanical butterfly._

_Nerai smiles, not needing a translation to understand, "Oh, just a gizmo." She shrugs, as if it were nothing. Just a cantrip, something to occupy her mind. She offers it to the chieftan, "You can have it, if you want." Her demeanor is respectful, the butterfly just finishing it's flapping as she proffers it._

_The furbolg who spoke carefully takes the mechanical toy from the goblin's hands, and shows it to his chieftain, who nods. "_" says the elder furbolg. "_" The chieftain bows to Nerai, and addresses Ezra. ""___

___"I susspect that she knows," murmurs Ezra.___

___Nerai in turn, simply nods. Body language is not hard to read.___

___Saeren turns to Ezra, "So do we have a job to do here?"___

___The chieftain leans back, and looks at Nerai's cart, then at Ezra. "_"____

____Switching to Draenic, Ezra continues. "We will go after the goblins," he says. "We will investigate the matter carefully, but quickly. Then we will rescue the furbolg who are captive."____

____Saeren looks to Nerai, "I think I'm going to shoot some of your more distant cousins." She shrugs, "They probably won't greet us with open arms anyway, but.. are you okay with this?"____

____Nerai shrugs at Saeren. "If we've learned anything throughout our journies, I think it's that one's species is seperate from one's self."____

____Saeren nods to Nerai. "Let us get this business started and over with swiftly."____

The furbolg leads the companions through the woods. "Our village is some ways ahead, through the forest," he says, with Ezra continuing to serve as translator. "But we must be cautious. Some of the greenskins have glittering eyes that they wear over their real eyes. They see very keenly, like the eagle. Even I would have trouble slipping close enough to see them without being seen."

The challenge just brings a smile to Saeren's face. "At least we won't be bored."

Nerai thinks about how to proceed. "It's not like we can effectivly keep Eecee a secret while trying to leverage his strengths... So maybe he could be the bait for a trap?"

Ezra thinks a moment. "What are the weaknessess of thiss type of armor?" he asks of Nerai.

Nerai ponders this for a second. "Well, it's hard to conceal. And it's subject to fuel consumption. Magic can kind of wreck it." She says, looking back at Eecee...

"Should I just go and shoot one of them and see who chases me?" asks Saeren.

Ezra nods. "Would their fuel ssuppliess catch fire if sstruck by a flaming weapon?" he asks craftily, eyeing Saeren's bow.

Nerai nods. "Phlogiston is rather flamable, once it's compressed into gas. That's why it's kept in the vials."

Nerai quickly adds, "Most armors have their evaporators and fuel internal, though, to avoid combustion."

Ezra smiles. "Very well. We musst find this substance, where they sstockpile it. Cut off their ssupply. Then wear down their machines, yes. Much ssafer than pitched battle."

Nerai nods. "Also, I might be able to sabatoge their machines. Surely they all can't know how to build them..."

"I will study their camp and find out who appears to be a mechanic," says Saeren. She pauses a moment, "And I will disempower them at the earliest convenience."

"Firsst, a map of the camp, if you please. We should overfly it at night," suggests the wizard.

The furbolgs are not accustomed to maps; their kind does not typically go in for writing. Nevertheless, they are intimately familiar with the woods and with their own bodies. Once they understand what the 'civilized' races need of them, directions in terms of paces are translated into a rough sketch map.

The furbolg village is surrounded by deep woods on all sides, but a broad gap in the trees is shown to the south. "One of their riding beasts had gleaming teeth on its arms," explains the furbolg, growing angry as he recounts the tale. "They chew through great trees like you or I might gnaw a bone."

Ezra lays out, briefly, his idea for an attack on the camp: identify the phlogiston stockpiles the goblins may have, eliminate them, and make a fast assault on any remaining steam armors the goblins may be able to muster. Without these things, the goblins will be armed with firearms and other technology, but they will still be goblins.

The furbolgs think about this. "You have magic that will make Saeren fly," says the chieftain, "but surely the goblins will be suspicious when they see a person fly overhead? Even a slender and hairless person like her. She is not of their kind, after all."

"She will be high, and it will be dark," counters Ezra. "And they must sleep."

"Ahh," says the furbolg peering at the sky. "The moon is still bright, but she is fading. If Saeren flies high enough, she may appear to be a bird." He peers at Saeren. "Are you certain that you can see farther than they? If you are high enough to be a bird, they will be low enough to be ants."

"I don't need to see them to kill them," says Saeren. "I just need to hit their phlogiston."

"She can also ssimply sneak in," shrugs Ezra. "Magic may conceal her for a time. We will do what sseems besst."

Ezra continues. "We musst lure the other armors out. We musst keep them engaged until they alsso run out of fuel."

He faces the furbolg guide. "Can your people assist in thiss? All you musst do is run, and live. Do not fight. Jusst be prey, and sstay alive."

The chieftain nods. "Our spears cannot pierce their beasts, but they can pierce goblins. So they will send the beasts to protect themselves. We only need to seem a threat to the smaller ones."

---

With the coming of night, the plan begins. Ezra's magic again gives the night elf archer the ability to fly. Her first objective is to get a layout of the goblin's camp, something she can do in general from a considerable height. Most would be awed or terrified so far from the ground, but Saeren is simply focused.

From this distance, high up, she can see that the furbolgs' information is somewhat out of date. Half the village appears to have been leveled, and there is a cart in the middle, near where the firepit would have been. The back half of the cart consists of a large metal cage, open on the back.

In addition, Saeren can see a smattering of smaller cages around the village, each containing a sleeping furbolg. Most of the huts look deserted, but smoke curls from the chimneys of a few.

Beside one of the occupied huts is an unpiloted goblin machine, clearly a larger cousin to Eecee, with sawblades attached to the ends of its arms. Beside it are a few crates emblazoned with red warning symbols on the lids.

Eight goblin guards can be seen, six of them around the edges of the village and two in the center, apparently watching the prisoners. At one point, Saeren sees one of the goblins, a strange mechanical apparatus mounted to its head, gaze skyward, moonlight glinting off what appear to be a set of complicated spectacles. It peers up for several seconds, then resumes watching the forest.

Saeren grins at the sight of the guard. She reaches down into her belt pouch, pulls out a small chunk of wood. There is nothing special about it. Hovering carefully above the phlogiston, and waiting for the wind to die, she casts it carelessly, opposite the guards and past the phlogiston. The ideal place for a sound to come from that would draw the interest of a guard or two. In the next moment, she's drawn an arrow and taken aim at the crates.

For several long seconds, nothing happens. And then - though she's too high up to hear very much - she sees three rifle barrels swing toward the edge of the forest where she'd thrown the chunk of wood.

Saeren's aim is true. The first arrow plunges straight into the crate, and it blossoms into flames. The nearest goblins take a few hurried steps toward it, then cry out and sprint away as fast as they can. Against that, for the moment, the second arrow is unnoticed by anyone except its unfortunate victim, who yells and clutches at its arm, beating out the fire ignited on its shirt.

And before anything else can happen, the crates go up in an enormous explosion, engulfing the steam armor and the nearby hut in a spectacular fireball that casts shadows throughout the camp. As the fireball clears, the hut is merrily ablaze, and the steam armor likewise appears to be covered with something clinging and burning. Three goblins spill out of the hut, apparently dressed in nightclothes, and also on fire.

Down in the village below, Saeren sees another gleam of spectacles from the goblin on the far side. She hears faint sounds of orders being given, and then the sharp bark of rifles being fired.

The great distance is Saeren's ally. She hears the whistle of one rifle bullet not far away, but none of the other shots come anywhere near her.

"She has blown up their beasts!" cries one of the subordinate furbolgs, and runs forward recklessly. The chieftain raises a paw as if to stop him, and then shrugs, calling "Follow me!" and leading the rest of his pack into the fracas.

Nerai starts up the engines and Eecee roars to life, as she points him in the right direction, getting ready to take off to the camp.

Meanwhile, the rest of the goblins fire their rifles, with as little effect as the first volley.

Ezra mutters the syllables of a spell he's been readying ever since he saw the first plume of fire go up, and an aura of protection surrounds him.

After a quarter of their number goes down in a handful of seconds, the rest of the goblins have little stomach for the fight. They scatter in all directions, except for the three still rolling on the ground to put out their flaming nightshirts.

Saeren swoops down, surveying the wreckage. She makes sure the captive Furbolg are in no danger and calls out to them in draenic, "Your people are on their way!" She hastens after the wounded goblin, curious to see just where it goes.

Meanwhile, one of the fleeing goblins runs full tilt right into the onrushing furbolgs. At the first sight of them, he squeaks in terror, throws his rifle to the ground, and runs the other way, but hardly gets a dozen paces before the furbolg chieftain picks him up in one paw. "Please! Spare me! I'll give you everything I have!" squeaks the goblin, to the rather unsympathetic-looking furbolg.

Nerai shakes her head as she sees this. "You know, not everyone wants money!" She calls out, to the Goblin. "You should probably spare him, however." She says. The Furblogs may or may not understand, but the Goblin will.

Ezra has adopted his unnatural tomb-dust form, and as a cloud of vaporous soil whirls his way into the encampment, mindful of anything that remains a threat. He seeks out the captives first, intending to act as an escort should they need it.

The furbolgs do not understand Nerai's words, but they understand the tone well enough. "Hold him," says the furbolg chief, throwing the squealing goblin bodily toward one of his companions. "Onward!" he calls, mindless of the dust cloud that whispers past him.

Said dust cloud arrives in time to see three goblins, their nightclothes still smoldering, looking around in terror at the sudden absence of their allies, and the furbolgs, now fully awake, rattling the bars of their cages.

The cloud of dust coalesces into the black-clad undead form of Ezra, and he speaks loudly in furbolg to the captives: "Help is coming!" With that, he whips his body into a cloud of dust once again and lifts off, 'watching' the area for other threats.

The three goblins gape at Ezra and immediately run off, only to run full-tilt into the furbolgs. They cower on the ground and are promptly captured. Kagarn points to the cage and calls out, "Put your captives in that cage!", then immediately heads for the motionless and arrow-festooned forms of the two goblins Saeren had struck down.

Nerai is going to try and time her entrance to be AFTER that of the furblogs, so that maybe the cheiftan can explain to the captors that she's not a bad guy. In any case, when they get into the village, Nerai will first start rounding up any Goblins that are still alive, and restraining them. Incidentally looking for familiar faces.

Nerai arrives just in time to see the furbolgs throw their captives into the cart, and the chieftain pointing off into the woods in all directions and growling in his native tongue. Several of the furbolgs rush off into the woods, following trails that are obvious even to Nerai's relatively untrained eyes.

This attended to, the chieftain sets two of his kin guarding the goblins' prison while he heads to the cages holding the furbolgs. He pounds on one of the locks with a heavy club, then beckons to Nerai, pointing to the cage locks.

Nerai nods at the cheiftan. Nerai pulls a tool out of her belt, and gestures. She gets dwon from Eecee, and simply picks the locks, rather than forcing them. Cages are useful, after all.

The first furbolg to be freed smashes the cage door open, throwing Nerai to the ground, and taking a few strides toward her, before being restrained by his chieftain. There is a brief, growled exchange, and then the captive heads toward the cart. The chieftain raises his head and yells at the top of his lungs - Nerai has to cover her ears - evidently addressing his whole tribe. The rest of the furbolgs give Nerai no trouble when they are freed, some of them even bowing respectfully.

Meanwhile, the goblin Saeren is tracking stops running after half a minute, panting and looking around him desperately. When he looks up and sees nothing, he reaches for his belt, fiddles with a device he finds there, and then sets off in a new direction. About twenty seconds after that, Saeren sees a furbolg following the goblin's trail.

Saeren waits for the furbolg to draw near, then makes a gesture for silence and another to wave it back. She points to herself, and then to the furbolg, and then with a nod leads on, hoping the creature will understand this is not a race, but a stalking.

The furbolg growls briefly, and then his lips curl in a smile, and he slackens his pace. The goblin's labored breathing can be heard some distance ahead; there is no danger of losing him, nor does the goblin show any awareness of being followed.

The goblin leads his pursuers southward, toward the shore. Presently, they can hear the sounds of the surf... and over those sounds, the distinctive sound of machinery and the crunching of stone. If Saeren rises above the treetops, she can even see a plume of smoke rising into the night sky, visible primarily because it is lit from within by a dull red glow.

Saeren sees the destination ahead and looks to the Furbolg. She points ahead at the goblin, then gestures her hands together in an approximation of what she imagines the Furbolg will do to put the goblin down, like strangle it. Just in case, she'll draw an arrow as well and take the sky.

From her perch in the sky, she sees the furbolg catch up to the fleeing goblin, who squeaks and tries to sprint forward, only to be bowled to the ground by a swing of the bear-man's enormous paw. Already wounded by Saeren, the goblin does not move, and the furbolg gathers up its still form and carries it back to camp.

She also gets a clearer view of the goblin's destination. The plume of smoke comes from a hastily built construction of wood and steel, with a steam engine in the middle belching flames from its smokestack. At least four steam armors lurk around its base. Dozens of goblins scurry around the construction, awake even at this time of night, and a large open-sided stockade can be seen beside the mouth of a cave, holding at least a dozen sleeping furbolgs. Several more furbolgs, in chains, can be seen going in and out of the entrance to a cave in the cliff face nearby.

And, emerging from a little shack near the top of the ramshackle goblin base... a naga female with two burly male bodyguards.

---

As the ten surviving goblins are rounded up, stripped of their gear, and put in the cage - two of them still unconscious after suffering fire from the sky - the furbolg chieftain counts the heads of his people, converses with them, and then calls out. "Dead man! Where are you? This is not all of my people!"

Ezra swirls back into his humanoid form, having been hovering nearby. "Then we are not yet done, are we," he replies evenly. "We will ssee what our sscout has to ssay on the matter when she returns, yes."

The chieftain nods. "My fellows say that their brothers and sisters were taken off in a cart much like this one," he says, banging on the side of the prison and startling the goblins. "They traveled off to the south. We don't know which way."

Nerai, for her part, is busily inspecting the tree trimmer steam armor they had here, trying to determine what sorts of damage it had. "Man, Goblins have bad taste in design." SHe comments, to noone in particular.

"They will be found and resscued," promises Ezra grimly. "And we will .... put thiss matter right, yes."

"We saw the greenskins' lair!" calls a furbolg voice from the woods; he is carrying the dead goblin he captured. Overhead, Saeren can be seen flying to rejoin them.

Ezra sees the flying elf arrive and coughs. "There are other furbolgss, yes," he explains. "They musst be found."

"And naga," Saeren shoots back as she lands. "By the way, this flight is incredibly useful. They never knew what hit them." She manages a rather dark smile and goes on, "In any case, there are more captives, and more armor to deal with. I don't think they are aware of what happened here yet, though. I didn't wait around to investigate very long after I saw the naga."

Ezra nods slowly. "We musst interrogate the goblinss soon, yess," he muses, half to himself.

"They may be under control," adds Saeren.

Meanwhile, Nerai is gratified to discover that, despite the brutal and slapdash aesthetics of the goblin shredder, it is largely intact, although one of its saw blades is warped by the phlogiston fire and its outer steel hull is lightly melted. With a few salvaged parts and some competent repair work, it could be put back into working order in a few days.

Kagarn looks around. "We are fortunate," rumbels the tauren. "No loss of life amongst our allies, and only one slain amongst our foes." He looks to the south. "Though tomorrow, we will need far greater fortune to accomplish the same."
