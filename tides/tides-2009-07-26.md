Back at Azure Watch, the furbolg tell the rest of their story, with the assistance of Ezra and the draenei shamen on translation.

"We have worshipped at Tides' Hollow for generations," says the Stillpine chief shaman, Arugoo. "My father taught me the ways of the water spirits there, as his father had before him. We of the Stillpine depend on the sea, as much as the land, for our living - spearfishing in the surf, curing hides - and it is at Tides' Hollow that we speak with the spirits of the sea, presenting offerings in return for their blessing."

"Not long ago, three sunsets after the moon had begun to return, the Siltfin murlocs invaded Tides' Hollow. They have long sought its power, but this time they were accompanied by large, serpentine beings, which you call naga. They commanded great magics, and our spears bounced off the armor of their menfolk. We retreated, but watched for our chance. Perhaps the naga would leave, and we would reclaim our rightful place."

"It was not to be. The moon had begun to wane again, just under a week ago, when an enormous wooden contraption came up on the beach, and several small green-skinned creatures emerged, in their smoking metal beasts." Arugoo nods to Nerai. "They began to fell the trees nearby, using some of them to build another monstrous contraption - it is probably that which you saw, night elf - and the other trees were fed into the thing the goblins built."

Nerai looks up, "They're probably using the heat from the trees to distil phlogiston from the air. It's common among my people, dispite the fact that there are better ways..." She sighs, "It's fast, and cheap, at least..."

Arugoo nods. "So the steam creatures eat trees? Or at least, they eat this... phlogiston... which the goblins make from trees. I am not surprised."

"The slaughter of the forest, of course, was a further insult," continues High Chief Stillpine, taking up where Arugoo left off. "We attacked them as well, but if anything, their steam creatures were even tougher against our spears than the naga armor. Arugoo led his shamans against them, and the spirits of air sent their lightnings, which was effective - but the rest of the steam beasts threw fast-moving, bulky spears, which erupted in terrible fire. Arugoo lost three of his brightest pupils, and we were forced to retreat."

"And so we watched, once more," continues Arugoo. "And then, a few days ago, the goblins assaulted Bristlelimb and carried off half our people. Those of us who survived made our way here, where we found the blue-skinned ones. We were afraid, at first, but when I learned that they too know of the spirits of the land, we sought out their help."

The chieftain nods to Ezra, Saeren, Nerai, and Kagarn. "We had only begun to speak with them, when you arrived. We are grateful for the help you have given already, but you tell me that the survivors of Bristlelimb are still held by the goblins and the naga. It would be a great blow to our tribe to lose them."

"The murlocss that I have met value ssolitude and issolation, yess," observes Ezra. "The Ssiltfin.. they live in the area?"

"They live around the coast," says Arugoo. "But we saw others who were not of the Siltfin. That was strange indeed. The murloc tribes seldom work together."

Ezra nods thoughtfully. "They sserve out of fear of the naga, yess. Curiousss... that you all venerate the ssame spiritss, have the ssame needss, and yet work againsst each other..."

Nerai stares at one of the other Goblins. She speaks in Golbin, "What clan do you come from, gutterswipe?" She spirs on the ground in front of the cage.

The goblin at the front of the cage - apparently the closest to a leader in the survivors - cringes back. "We're all different clans here. We're with the Venture Company - they don't care what clan you are as long as you think quick or fight well. Hell, we even take non-goblins. In low-level positions, of course." He leers at Nerai. "Why - want a job? Or you too tied up in clan loyalty to want to work for the up-and-comers in the goblin world?"

Nerai leers back, "Oh yeah. Because I would be doing this if all I cared about was money. Filth." Still in Goblin. She turns back to Ezra and shrugs...

A light goes on in Ezra's glowing eyes. "But of coursse," he murmurs, then switches to Goblin as well. "You there, you Venture Company mercenaries. We'll do you a deal better than the naga. Because your current situation means death at the claws of the furbolg."

"Hah!" exclaims the goblin foreman. "You heard the bear-man. The furbolg can't touch our steam armor, except for their voodoo guys, and our rocket grenades turn _them_ into smoking rubble."

"Are you in your steam armor at the moment?" asks Ezra dryly.

The foreman blinks, and backs away. The rest of his cadre looks similarly nervous. "Oh... you mean _us_, right _now_." He coughs. "W-what can I do ya for, boss?" he says to Ezra with something vaguely approximating respect.

Nerai fumes and turns her back on her countrymen. She can't believe her fellow Goblins sometimes. She looks distingly pissed off, but is turned away from the proceedings for a moment.

"We musst rescue the remaining furbolg," explains Ezra. "Right now the only creaturess able to enter the cave and not be attacked on site are... you goblinss. You will convey meanss of escape to the furbolg inside. They will esscape with ssuitable distraction. We will take care of the naga. You will be allowed to go free, with payment for sservices rendered."

"You musst sell this deal to any goblinss inside the cave as well," the wizard continues. "And.. if you betray uss while insside, you will share the fate of the naga therein." This is a point he does not feel like elaborating upon.

"And... if we don't do this thing for ya, you turn us over the the bear-guys?" askse the foreman, eyeing Arugoo nervously. "Just wanna make sure I understand the deal, y'know."

Nerai looks over her shoulder, "Yes. Possibly one at a time..."

Ezra takes a few moments to explain the proposed plan to the draenei and the furbolg as well.

"Y'know, boss," says one of the other captives, in Goblin. "This could be a good deal for ya, especially if we can take down ol' Cogscraper. You know he's gotten awful chummy-" "Ixnay!" hisses the foreman, and begins gabbling to her - the words are all in Goblin, but they make no sense when put together. Even Nerai cannot follow, although she recognizes a private trade cant when she hears it. From the body language, however, the female subordinate's opinion seems to be carrying the day, and when the foreman turns back, he is nodding. "All right. We got the keys to the cages an' shackles, it'll be easy enough ta unlock what we need to unlock." He looks at the furbolg chieftain. "One thing. What do we say to yer buddies so's they don't rip us to shreds when we free 'em?"

When the goblin's query is translated, the chieftain nods. "I will teach you a short speech in our tongue. They will know it is me who taught this to you, and will accept that you mean them no ill."

The Forsaken wizard continues explaining his plan of attack, now primarily to the draeenei. His intent is to defend the furbolg at the cave entrance - first to eliminate any naga sentries posted outside, then to receive furbolg as they leave the cave and to attack naga who do so. An explosive charge should collapse the cave entrance, and hopefully leave the combined forces outside with a collection of naga prisoners.

At this point, Ssudran speaks up. "Have you given any thought to what the naga are _doing_ here?" she says.

"They mean to use ssomething in the cave," answers Ezra, as though it were the most obvious thing in the world. "That is.. for the furbolg to ansswer then, yess."

"Or for me," replies the lamia sorceress. "It's pretty clear what they're up to. A place of power for water elementals - water spirits, as your rustic friends call them - they're obviously trying to make more Chalices of Dagun." She glances at the goblins. "And my former people must have accelerated their timetable, if they are willing to employ outsiders so freely. Normally, for such a task, we would employ naga or murloc laborers."

Nerai thinks, "They must require a lot of power in order to try and do such a thing..."

"The geomancy is right for a ley line nexus to the southwest," Ssudran replies. "And if it is in a marine cave system, it would naturally draw the attention of water elementals." Her eyes glint. "But this is a golden opportunity for us," she says, eyeing Saeren. "If it has enough power to create chalices of Dagun... it can be used to create chalices of _your_ sort. All we have to do is take it from the naga."

Nerai smiles, "Depriving the Naga of things seems to be what we do..."

Ssudran rubs her chin. "Let's see... you plan to seal off the cave entrance," she says to Ezra. "Are you attempting to trap them in there?"

"They musst eat," the mage says simply. "Mosst important is the lives of the furbolg."

"Fine, fine," says Ssudran waving a hand. "Do you care if they escape? They can swim, you know." She turns her attention to the furbolg. "Does this Tides' Hollow cave open out into the sea, underwater?"

"We do not know," says Arugoo. "The caverns go deeper than our own people are willing to swim."

"The sspirits of the Hollow musst know," points out Ezra. "You have sshamanss, yes. What say they?"

Arugoo pulls a carved water totem from the rope belt tied around his waist. "We have not had occasion to ask, until now. Let us find out."

---

This stretch of beach is largely deserted, populated only by the sand-crabs, seagulls, and other animal denizens of such places. It is a few miles east of Tides' Hollow, out of sight of the goblin phlogiston factory - the closest point to the caverns that can be found.

Arugoo plants the water totem at the edge of the surf, neatly spearing the fish he had brought with him. "Draenei... tauren... murloc," he says, addressing his fellow shamans. "I ask your assistance. Not enough of my younger shamans have survived to aid in the ritual." The furbolg kneels at the edge of the beach, arms outstretched, and calls out in his native tongue; the other shamans, at his request, join in.

Presently, one of the waves swells higher than the rest, eventually forming a vaguely humanoid shape instantly recognizable as a water elemental. _Why have you summoned me?_ it intones with the voice of the raging surf.

Arugoo remains kneeling. "My people have served you for generations at Tides' Hollow. We have been barred from that place this past month, and we seek your aid in recovering it, that we may resume the rituals."

_What is it to us?_ says the elemental, its shoulders rising in a shrug. _The rituals have continued unimpeded. We remain well served at Tides' Hollow. What more can you offer us?_

"My kinsmen," says the murloc which the party had freed from Dagun during the ocean crossing. "The naga must have had my people take over, to propitiate the water spirits while they worked."

Arugoo frowns, and turns to the water elemental. "Can you at least tell us whether Tides' Hollow opens to the sea?"

_It does,_ replies the spirit.

The furbolg blinks, then bows its head. "Can you show us where?"

The water elemental shakes its own head in denial. _That is the domain of the spirits of Tides' Hollow, who aid whoever serves them. They will only speak of the seaward exits to those who propitiate them there._

Ezra steps forward, leaning heavily on his cane. "Spirit of water," he croaks in Kalimag, "though the undead are corruption and water is purity, I command your lesser fellows. I know the secret names of the Hydraxian waterlords and I have never faltered in my obligations to your kin. But know this - we are at war with those in the cave. If we cannot ask this, we will have no choice but to slay those who do the rituals inside the cave. If you will not aid us, then I trust you will not also betray our intentions to the naga."

The spirit inclines its head to Ezra. _We serve whoever serves us,_ says the elemental. _It is up to you living creatures to squabble amongst yourselves to decide who that shall be._ The creature reaches down toward Arugoo's totem, its watery fingers stopping short of the wooden stake. _We do not betray those who serve us. Your sacrifices here ensure that I will not speak of this conversation; your sacrifices there, should you offer them, will win the cooperation of my fellows._

"The goblins do indeed pray to a spirit of silver and gold," whispers Ezra, stepping away. "Very well. The naga will avail themsselves of an esscape, if they can. We musst simply be aware of it, yess."

Arugoo nods, drawing the stake out of the sand; the water elemental's hand surges forward, engulfing the fish. When the hand recedes, there is no sign that the fish was there. "We thank you, o great spirit." The water elemental nods, and moves backward, merging with the surf until it is no more than a receding wave.

As the party approaches Bristlelimb with the goblins in tow, the goblin foreman, Crankfizzle, seems to have something on his mind. "So... lemme tell ya what we got in mind," he says. "We're gonna go talk to our buddy goblins, an' make sure they're all on the same page. And then we're gonna slip the furbolgs the keys to their chains and their cells, and then we're gonna skedaddle, an' we'll come back later for our back pay. That's whatcha have in mind, right?"

"That is the deal," responds Ezra.

"Okay. So... there's one other thing I wanna get straight. We ain't gonna tell our bossman Cogscraper. An' I'll tell ya why, cause that's the main reason this deal's gonna work for my buddies. It's cause like my loose-lipped colleague here said," he says, indicating a goblin woman who blushes purple, "he's been actin kinda funny. I mean, good relations with the clients, _yes_, but he's gotten way too buddy-buddy with them. Constantly in private meetings... heck, Toggle here thinks she saw him goin' swimming with them. That ain't good for business, see, gettin too friendly with the clients. We're worried they'll have him over a barrel with the next contract."

"Or in a chalice," suggests Ezra drolly. "I ssuggest checking for gills on your next encounter, yesss."

One of the other goblins blinks. "Gills? Like on the neck? I _wondered_ why he was sporting all those high collars allofasudden." Crankfizzle rubs his chin. "So you think they got him under some kind o' mind control? Yeah, that makes sense. Listen... the deal is, I'm gonna take his place, see? So be on the lookout for him." Crankfizzle describes the goblin gang leader in as much detail as he can, as well as the steam armor he conventionally drives. "If you can recover the steam armor, that's great. If not, just make sure I get the bits, at least. Deal?"

Nerai looks at Crankfizzle, and rubs her chin, "Gotta be worth something, this armor, yes?" She smiles a perverse Goblin smile. Then she shrugs, "We'll give you what we find, and that can be your 'back pay'... Deal?"

"I don't recall this being part of our bargain," notes Saeren flatly.

Crankfizzle glances between Nerai and Saeren. "Hey... you guys gotta at least gimme a straight answer here. The Gearstripper's part of our little Venture Company division! If you guys can't at least get me the wreckage, I'm gonna have to build another one from scratch!" The goblin's voice is taking on a whining edge, and his eyes take in the various draenei and furbolg who march alongside.

Nerai looks at Saeren. "Honor isn't honor if applied subjectivly." She smiles back at Crankfizzle, "Like I said, you get any of the bits of the armor we find, and that squares us, deal?"

"Justice," replies Saeren. "The honorable thing has already been eschewed for the unpleasant demands of necessity."

Crankfizzle's eyes flick to the night elf, realizing that, of the various potential enemies he faces here, Saeren is probably, if not the most deadly, then by far the most likely to intend him harm. He sighs. "Deal," he says, reaching out to shake Nerai's hand.

Nerai shakes Crankfizzle's hand, and nods.

---

The goblins are turned loose at Bristlelimb, and make great haste for Tides' Hollow as if wild animals are at their heels - which, given the furbolgs' notorious distrust and ferocity, is close to true.

In fact, the allied draenei and furbolg forces follow at a discreet distance, stopping at the treeline, and looking out over the field of cleared stumps as the goblins rejoin their companions.

Saeren is the first to recognize the signs of the plan being put into action. She sees goblin taskmasters walk along the rows of furbolg slaves as they're escorted in and out of the cave; she sees one of the goblin wardens appear to be in conversation with the caged furbolgs, after which he does something at the door and then walks away. The furbolg appear to have gotten the message, since they show no signs of going for the door.

Finally, she sees Crankfizzle head for the top of the phlogiston distillery and enter the control shack at the top. Moments later, there is a loud bang, as one of the valves overloads - followed by the smoke from the chimney shifting from black to red. Immediately, the furbolg outside strip their chains, open their cages, and head for the treeline, mingling with a horde of goblins who are likewise fleeing. Three male naga at the cave entrance, startled, draw their swords, only to be mobbed by several dozen furbolg at once.

The signal given, the draenei and furbolg pour from the forest, charging across the ravaged timberland adjoining the shore. Goblins scatter in all directions, looking panicked as the charge advances, but apparently breathing easier when the attackers appear to be ignoring them.

Meanwhile, the commotion at the cave entrance only escalates. By the time the charge reaches them, there are explosions of fire and frost at the cave entrance, and the air is filled with the pained roars of dying furbolgs. A few naga sorceresses, with their armored bodyguards, appear at the entrance just in time to fall before the draenei, who (unlike the furbolgs) match them for technology and magic, and for the moment, beat them in numbers.

Crankfizzle catches up with the heroes at the entrance. "Most of my people are out," he says. "No sign of Cogscraper, though. The boys think he's deeper inside, with our most senior stonesmiths and the naga."

Chief Stillpine joins the impromptu conference. "Most of my people have been rescued," he says. "There are no more than a few of my kin left inside." He fixes Ezra and Exarch Menelaous with a stare. "Do not hold back on their account. The Stillpine do not negotiate for hostages."

"You do not enter a battle you cannot win," answers Ezra calmly. "Do we now have the numberss to attack the naga by main force?"

"They have a means to bring in reinforcements, just as we do," says Saeren.

Menelaous turns a questioning gaze to the furbolg chieftain, who scratches his chin. "The naga inside... they number less than half your people here. There are more murlocs, but only a third as many as _my_ people. If you and your kin can deal with the magic and steel of the naga, we can deal with the murlocs on equal terms."

Saeren grins, "Some of us have been dealing with their steel and magic for some time. We will be ready for them."

"Above all we musst kill the murloc shamanss," points out Ezra. "Thiss will ssecure uss an advantage with the spiritss."

Arugoo steps forward, with three of his kin, four draenei shamen, and a bundle of seaweed. "Now that we hold the entrance of the cave, we can at least match their efforts." They conduct a ritual similar to the earlier ceremony at the beach; in response, three smaller elementals emerge from the tidepool at the mouth of the cave. Eventually, the three elementals nod, consuming their offerings. _Do you have any amongst you who can swim?_

The draenei shamen volunteer, as does Ssudran and her two lamia allies. "We may have lost our gills," she explains, "but our lungs are still strong. We have not lost our connection to the sea - only to the dark god that seeks to rule it."

Ssudran fixes a gaze on Ezra. "Keep your ears and your mind open," she says. "I will inform you what hold the naga have over the underwater exits." The elementals dive into the sea, with their allies following behind.

Nerai examines the enterance to the cave. She looks over the crags, and the various features. She selects three spots to lay charges, and begins to wire them up. Attaching the wire to each charge, and running them all to a detinator, a short by saft ways off. SHe finds some Draenei sentinels to watch over the device, with explicit orders not to blow it until they are given the signal.

As Nerai prepares the cave entrance, Menelaous assembles his forces for the second assault. The furbolg will fight alongside armored draenei warriors; given their lack of military training, the bear-men will simply be expected to fight as they see fit, with the draenei working around them as best they can. Archers and mages will occupy the back ranks, dealing with their opposite numbers amonst the naga.

As the sergeants order their squads into position, he seeks out the adventurers. "You four are more potent than any but my most elite fighters," he says. "And you have experience working together. Let us consult together to find how to best use your talents."
