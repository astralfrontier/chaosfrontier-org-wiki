The adventurers step through the portal. But not together - one at a time. And the wash of arcane energies obscures the fact that not all arrive together.

Nerai finds herself standing inside a spacious cave. The texture of the walls and ceiling are uneven, showing bands of light and dark rock that twist and turn their way about the cavern. Narrow tendrils of limestone hang from the ceiling. The center of the cave is an island surrounded by an underground lake. Shafts of brilliant sunlight break through holes in the rock overhead. The light joins with the water in a fusion of blue, green and shadowed darkness.

The goblin tinker's previous companions are nowhere to be seen. The only other occupant of this cave seems to be a robed and hooded creature the size of a goblin, bearing a long ashen staff and standing a distance away on the island. One of its hands pulls back the hood to reveal the smiling face of a goblin female. "You are Nerai Escapement. And I'm Edda, the Watcher."

Nerai looks around the cave. She's not sure this is where she should have turned up when she stepped through. "Edda?" She looks at the lake, and continues on, to stand at the edge. Or, at least, she guides Eecee that way. Even through the time field her instincts come back easily. She looks curiously at the figure.

"Yes, that's right." The goblin steps closer, tapping the tip of her staff against the rocky surface. "Before you reach your final destination, I've been asked to intervene - and ask you for some help. You see, you may not succeed."

Nerai blinks curiously, Eecee now standing at the edge of the lake. She looks curiously at the figure, "We may not..... Wait, how do you-" She interrupts herself, and breathes once, "What do you need to be done?"

Edda waves her staff, and Nerai can see another portal shimmer into existence. This one, however, looks different from those few she's seen. "This is a doorway into dream," the Watcher explains. "Touch it, and you will enter the dreams of someone who may succeed where you didn't - or perhaps even aid you if you do. Encourage them. Set them on the same path you're on now. Make a hero out of them."

Nerai blinks and turns to Edda. She ponders for a second, but can't even manage to collase her thoughts into a question worth asking. So much is confusing to Nerai. She smiles, and nods, "Right." She says, and turns to the portal, Eecee's hand outstretching, and touching the surface.

"The night elves, and their World Tree, are depending on you, Nerai," whispers Edda.

Alnar Ironhammer is asleep. He's on the road in Dun Morogh, hiding from the rain under the remnants of an old glaive thrower - a siege weapon from the wars. A patchwork hide tarp protects him from the downpour of rain, and a little fire burns inside a circle of stones next to him. And within his dream, he wakes to find himself under the glave, staring at a goblin who sits near him.

Nerai looks over the old war engine, her eyes darting brightly and curiously around it's frame. She smiles, "Looks like it could use a little work, don't you think?" She smiles weakly at the Dwarf.

"It's sturdy enough for my needs," says the dwarf, sounding confused. "I'm Alnar - Alnar Ironhammer of the Explorers' League. Who are ye, lass? How came a goblin to be here?"

Nerai smiles, "I don't know how much time I have. And anyway, if I told you, you may not believe me." She smiles, "My name.... Nerai should do, for now." She trails off, and thinks for a moment, Ezra was always better at the lore then she. "What are you doing out here?" She looks into the horizon.. "Scratch that." The dizzying Goblin explains, "There's great things happening. Horrible. Horrible but far reaching..."

Nerai blinks, "Teldrassil... The great tree.. is in... danger." She stutters. She knows the danger, but seems to have lost some of the Goblin manner of speech, "It's roots are reaching down.. And wil soon bore into Dagun.." She sputters, all at once.

"Dagwon? Dagbert? What's this, now?" the dwarf asks, mystified.

Nerai smiles, "You know, I had the same reaction when it was first told to me." SHe looks at the engine, "Tell me, where are you off too?"

"I eh, I'm due back in Ironforge," Alnar explains. "I've been travelin' the world, y'see. Plant samples. I'm a botanist."

Nerai smiles brightly, "And so, you know of the great Elven tree, Teldrassil?"

"Och aye, I'm not _that_ in me cups, lass." Alnar laughs heartily. "I'd take meself some samples o' _that_ tree, except the sentinels would take a sample of me, I fear."

Nerai nods and smiles, "Well, it's roots are booring down into the lair of an Old One. Dagun specifically, but I don't know that it matters. What does matter is that once the roots reach where they are going, I'm sure you can imagine the concequences. As if a normal tree found poison." She smiles.

The dwarf's eyes widen. "Sure enough then, but why tell me, lass? It's the elves ye should be warnin'!"

Nerai shrugs, "If I understood, then I would share. But you are the one I've been alloted to tell."

Alnar looks about his meager little campsite. "Well, err, what can I do to help ye about it then?" he asks finally. "It's my elder brother ye should talk to if ye want action. I'm nae important enough for a message of such weight."

Nerai blinks. "Personal importance is what you make of it, Alnar. YOU must do this. Not your brother, not the elves, but YOU must bring this message to those who matter most. I can see that you understand the signifigance, and perhaps that is why I was sent to tell you." She gestures with her claws, the wrench that she was fiddling with in her hands moving back and forth with her claws. "If there's anything I learned on my journey, it's that if you don't do something, noone will." With that, she digs into her pockets, and starts fiddlign with little bits of metal.

After a moment or two, Nerai pulls a little model of Teldrassil from her apron. She has amde a couple of branches into little hours and minutes hands, and attached the whole thing onto a string. She moves, to place the timepiece over his head. "There. You have the time, now take it." She smiles.

"But I... I'm no hero." Alnar's shoulders slump. "I wished to be like my brother, but I couldn't even travel to Winterspring wi'out a druid pullin me fat from the fire. How am I to do this?"

Nerai blinks for a moment. A problem she's never even thought of. "So, you're upset because you had to ask someone for help?" She smirks, "Rolf was a lot like that." She shakes her head, "Find friends, if you need them. Heroism is what you make of it." She gestures up to the glavelauncher, "Besides, you seem to have at least one good friend here."

"It's a friend to all dwarves," Alnar says with a proud smile. "Well, lass, I can promise nothin', you understand. But.. I'll see what there is to be done about it. Poison in the roots, y'say? I know who to speak to about such matters."

Nerai nods brightly, and slaps her claw against his back, "I'm sure you do... Now, please... Go..."

The vision fades. Nerai finds herself back in her steam armor, back with Edda, who smiles and nods. "Well done, my friend."

Nerai smiles, her claws gripping around Eecee's familiar controls. "Will I even know the outcome of what I've done?"

"Not for a long time, not if we did it correctly," Edda replies. "But I believe that what you did will be a benefit."

Nerai smiles, "A long time when?" She turns Eecee, and heads back out of the cave, her head shaking, but an unmistakable smile on her face as she steps back out into the time stream....

Rather than Silithus of the past, Saeren finds herself in a canyon. There's a narrow gap between two walls of rock that stretch upward for dozens of feet; overhead, she can see puffs of sand being blown over the edge by wind. She's in a desert somewhere, and the air smells dry.

The canyon has a few hints of green life here and there. A handful of hardy flowers, lengths of creeping vine, and moss ekeing out a bit of water from the soil. None of her allies are here. But there is one other person - a robed and hooded being with an ashen staff. It pulls back the hood to reveal the smiling face of a night elven woman. "You are Saeren Finblighter," she announces. "I am Edda, the Watcher."

Saeren's first reaction is wariness, but it fades with the words of her unexpected companion. "This isn't where I am supposed to be, Edda. Is this a part of the plan that I wasn't told about?"

"It is part of a new plan, yes." The watcher gestures with her staff. "This is a halfway place. I have a request to make of you. Once that is done, I will send you on your way. You see, if you and your allies should fail, the consequences to the future may be disastrous."

"Certainly to our future," replies Saeren. "But I think I understand...." She faces the watcher with confidence, "We will not fall short in this test. Still, to fail to plan is to plan to fail. What would you have me do?"

"A world torn by conflict is a world that produces heroes," Edda explains. "Those who feel compelled to rise up and serve a greater cause. You are one such, as evidenced by your actions. But if you fall, another must take up that great cause. Visit the dreams of one such hero, Saeren. Convince them of the danger to the Great One, to the night elves. Convince them to walk in your footsteps along the path you've already chosen. Will you do this?"

"I will."

Edda gestures with her staff. A portal materializes nearby, but unlike the ones Saeren has seen so far. "Touch its surface then, and lead someone forward."

Saeren walks to the portal and stares at its surface for a moment. She then reaches out, pushing a hand through to whatever lies beyond.

---

Touching the portal brings about a haze of darkness. Saeren finds herself drowning in a sea of obsidian ink. Screams of death and agony, mad tittering noises, and the heedless laughter of the damned torture her sensitive ears. She falls painfully to a jagged rocky plateau. Above her rises a mountain, or what would be a mountain if it weren't a solid block of ice carved into a horrid throne.

A corpse lies nearby. Its flesh is half eaten away, revealing skeleton in some places. The face is pockmarked with ruin. Looking around, Saeren sees more - in the distance, off the plateau, is a slaughter the likes of which she has never witnessed in memory. Cadavers, hundreds, thousands of them, all in various states of death or dismemberment. But unlike them, the corpse here stirs. It rises to its knees and begins to abase itself at the feet of the monstrous ice-throne. A harsh voice escapes its damaged throat. "Please," it whispers. "No more.. no more..."

Saeren surveys the terrain around her. She has seen the horror of battles, so while this is terrible, a nightmare given breathtaking form, she is able to steel herself against it and focus on the only one worth noticing. She moves closer, showing some caution but betraying no fear, "Who are you? What is this place?"

The creature looks up, eyes aglow with ghost light. It must be one of the Forsaken. It wears no bandages or other concealing clothing, just scraps of cloth; every horrid detail of its anatomy is clear. "I .. I am Silas. Silas VanCleef," it manages at last. "Who.. are you.. in this place? Why are you here? Are you to torment me as well?"

Saeren extends a hand to the Forsaken, "I am here to remind you that you stand on your own feet, Silas. My name is Saeren Finblighter. I have no desire to torment you."

"What do you want then?" asks the creature, eyeing Saeren warily.

"I want you to stop kneeling before this hunk of ice," replies the night elf. "I know one of your people. I know how strong you can be, if you have the will. I am here to find out if you are what this world needs."

"I do not do this out of admiration," spits Silas. "I wish for the pain to stop. Your presence.. has eased the torment somehow. How is this?"

"You are exercising your will now," replies Saeren. "And you are hoping once more, there is a fire in you, Silas. If there is less torment in you now, I assure you it is nothing that I have brought. The pain you feel can only be mastered by you."

"That is what the Lady teaches us," the Forsaken says, still eyeing Saeren with doubt.

"The Lady is wise and strong. She is proof of what you can be, if you wish it," replies Saeren. "I was sent here to speak to one who can change the future itself. You may not believe you are that person yet, but I assure you I am not wrong. Still, as you know, what I believe is of no importance. It is what you believe that matters."

"I am an architect and undead," answers Silas carefully. "What future am I to change? Build a monument to something, perhaps?"

"So you are a builder? That is good." Saeren smiles at this thought, "Well, Silas the architect, you are to build the greatest monument of all: a future for the people of Azeroth."

"Grand words," the Forsaken sneers, but he's too tired and strained for real mockery. "Speak plainly, elf."

"Have you ever heard the name Dagun?"

Silas shakes his head. "But it does not sound elvish."

"Dagun is not elvish, it is an Old God," replies Saeren. "An Old God that is reaching out through the waters to take Azeroth for its own. It ensnares the minds of those who drink its cursed waters and makes slaves of them."

Silas starts violently. But he doesn't elaborate. "Go on?"

"This Old God even now is seeking a far faster way to power," explains Saeren. "Even as it reaches out to enslave the minds of its enemies it burrows deep under the ocean floor, seeking the roots of Teldrassil."

"Teldrassil?" Silas barks out laughing. "Interesting."

"As an architect, you know the importance of structure and form," says Saeren. "Teldrassil is the support that holds the power of the night elves. Without it, we will be greatly weakened. With its power as its own, the Old God will quickly become among the greatest threats Azeroth has ever seen. Another force that enslaves the minds of others."

"Why should I care about the night elves?" asks Silas.

"If you are only interested in what is best for your own people, I would say that after Dagun has made the power of the night elves its own, there will be little that can challenge it," replies the elf. "If you have a vision beyond that, it is a night elf that now speaks to you and brings you to your feet. Whatever you might think, Silas, I am your friend and wish you and your people well."

"We are not called Forsaken without cause," replies the undead creature harshly. "Why then you should you care about _me_?"

"Who I care about is my own affair," says Saeren. "But I have chosen to care about you because one of my best friends, Ezra, is forsaken. He is also among the most intelligent and wise people I have ever met. He accepted me when few others would and it opened my heart to new possibilities. Even caring for a forsaken is not beyond me. Though I daresay it is a bit much to hope that I will ever love the naga."

"Interesting." Silas remains quiet for a few moments. "The voices are gone for now. Something......" He breaks off. "Regardless, I will consider what you have said."

"That is all I ask. Learn what you can learn, see the world with your own eyes, and do what you believe is right," says Saeren. "I believe my time here is done." The night elf salutes the forsaken with a smile. "Remain free, Silas."

"Dark Lady watch over you," whispers the Forsaken, as Saeren departs again through the dream portal.

Edda is standing in the canyon, watching Saeren. "Well done," she says with a smile.

"Silas has a good heart," answers Saeren. "He just needed someone else to remind him."

"Will I ever see him again, Edda?"

"If you succeed, his role in events shouldn't be necessary," says Edda soberly. "And if you fail...... well. I don't foresee a meeting between you two in that event, do you? Still, who can say? Perhaps a world tree with Nozdormu's blessing will return immortality to the elves. Then you might have all the time in the world to find each other."

"It would be good to see him again. I wonder what kind of a future he will build for himself." Saeren smiles once more, then focuses her mind again, "It is time for me to move on."

"Your portal awaits," says Edda, gesturing. And so one appears...

Ezra steps out to find himself standing on a high plateau of desert rock. Below him is a frozen tableau - himself, and his allies and enemies - motionless in an assortment of poses and situations. After a few moments of inspection, the crafty mage discerns the one common element. Each of these depicts some time in which he'd adopted the form of tomb-dust and used it to swarm his enemies or to surmount heights.

He turns, feeling a presence. Another being is on the mesa. It wears the form of a powerfully muscled blood elf and carries an ornately decorated halberd, but its eyes betray a hidden presence. Ezra smiles and speaks in Draconic. "Sso then, the Bronze Dragonflight wishess to reconssider ssending me into the passt?"

"I am Letodormu," the creature says, and adopts the form Ezra expected it to take - a mighty bronze dragon. It looks peculiar, more like one of the sand dredgers or worms of the southern desert than a proper drake. "The guardian of the sands of time and the Bronze Road they take throughout eternity. You have trespassed upon a place that was not yours to walk, and I have been tasked to hunt you. And yet you foolishly placed yourself into my domain - not once but twice. And now you will be sealed away."

"Explain yoursself," hisses Ezra. "We take thiss portal with the permission of--"

"SILENCE," booms the dragon, and the wizard obeys without hesitation. "I do not speak of this fool's errand you hope to run. I speak of your own personal use of the sands."

Ezra stops a moment, then looks down the face of the mesa. _The swarm form._ "An ancient magic of the Burning Legion," he says, turning back. "Harmless in itss applications--"

"It is not harmless," Letodormu interjects; again Ezra subsides. "That magic calls on the very Sands of Time. Used at its fullest power, it permits the crossing of all time and all dimension. Used with a moderate amount of mastery - perhaps a hundred mortal lifetimes of study - it would permit the reshaping of events into new patterns of probability. Even a mortal wizard might harness it to make minor changes in the timestream. And you? You've been using it for a parlor trick."

Ezra considers this. "It hass proven itss worth many timess over," he says at last, patiently eying the dragon in the hopes of discerning what will or won't spark its wrath. "What we do now, we do to ssave the night elven people from the danger of an Old God."

The dragon blinks slowly. "The geas of Elune is on you," it remarks. "Your return to the land of mortals? I see now. Well then. I shall not be too hasty in destroying you, but this irresponsible use of power must stop. I shall seal--"

The dragon steps forward, a claw outstretched. Ezra hesitates, unable to move. But the lumbering bulk has halted too. "-- No. NO. No!" The creature seems to shout into the air. "He is not--! No! But I have hunted him, just as--! .. Very well."

A claw extends forward, and with infinite delicacy the dragon carves a rune on Ezra's brow. "The power is sealed, but not fully. There is a use you may put it to. You have already spoken to one whose guidance will allow you to find it again. Now go, and complete your task." He gestures; Ezra sees another time portal open near to him.

Tipping his hat, the wizard takes it and departs.
