The Sepulcher of Silverpine was once nothing more than a common graveyard. However, most of its original population was removed to fight for the Scourge during the Third War - some of which regained their free will and returned to dwell there as Forsaken.

Most of the Sepulcher's 'dwellings' are the old mausoleums, with the old shacks of the former groundskeepers and some newer wooden constructions serving as the locations of such facilities as forges or alchemical laboratories which require better ventilation. It certainly lacks anything such as an airship tower - although the above-ground gravesites make an adequate temporary landing site for the Defiant.

Before the party disembarks, Ezra turns to his companions. He clasps his hands together, staring in particular at Nerai and Kagarn - the two most likely obstacles in the path of success right now.

"My family," he says. "A wife and child, yess. They are all that I remember at all from my mortal life. Even that iss.. lacking. But they have been threatened by the unfaithful Forssaken. Sso now I musst make ssure they are ssafe. That iss the most important..." He pauses. "It iss everything to me, you undersstand. Even fighting against the naga I do because of love for people who I don't even know. Do you undersstand?"

Nerai nods at Ezra. Nerai has understood this about her companion for quite a while now. "I understand this about you, Ezra. You use any means at your disposal in their favor..."

"We have spoken of this before, Ezra Pyreborn," replies Kagarn. "So long as you do not threaten the proper balance of the world, I will assist you in ensuring their safety."

The wizard nods. "And sso we come to another matter. Tirisfal Gladess must be held by the Forssaken. The Scarlet Crusade will indisscriminately slaughter uss if not, and the naga will surely co-opt them." He grins suddenly. "That iss why my plan is thiss. To infect them with the chalice of Dagun early. And I will use the unfaithful Forssaken as my instrument of victory."

Nerai looks at Ezra. "Seriously? Why would you do such a thing? It is beyond reason. 'It looks like our enemy would succeed, so let's make them more powerful?' Truely I do not see your plan here."

"It iss simple." Ezra begins to cackle as he speaks. "You, heheh, don't know the Sscarlet Crusade. They are terrified of the plague of undeath. Of becoming corrupted, tainted, infected, yess. I can't imagine why, hahaha..." He looks about him, at the melancholy woods beyond. "They are paranoid beyond reason. The Crussade will turn upon itself. Weaken itsself. And then we will desstroy them. Unless, of coursse, you had planned on letting them _live_ - on turning a fully mobilized fighting force over to the naga as foot soldiers on the northern continent?"

Kagarn had originally bristled when Ezra first revealed his plan, straightening to his full height and looming over the Forsaken mage. Now, however, he relaxes - slightly. "You play a dangerous game, Ezra. You hope to turn _part_ of the Crusade so that they fight amongst themselves. But having unleashed the plague of the naga upon the Crusade, what happens if you are _too_ successful?"

Ezra laughs. "The Sscarlet Crusade will _never_ stop, Kagarn," he explains. "They will purify and purge the taint from their element. Blood will run red in the Scarlet Monastery and Tyr's Hand, if it comess to that. Here iss the key to our success. Firsst, that we may lie to them, convince them they are receiving orderss from the naga which will not put them into the claws of those sea witchess. Ssecond, withhold the Chalice of Dagun from them sso that the infection cannot spread further. The ssecret of any good plague is to have the antidote."

Kagarn frowns. "I remind you that the plague _can_ spread without a chalice. I recall the stories from Bael Modan - the dwarves that were bitten by the infested troggs were themselves subject to the drowning compulsion."

Letting out a long sigh, Ezra nods. "You're right, Kagarn, you're right. Now if only there was ssome... I don't know, some _army of fanatical Paladins ready to cleansse the taint from them_." He stares up for a few moments. "Anything else?"

Nerai looks at Ezra. "It's not like the Scarlet Crusade are particularly honorable opponents to begin with." She looks at Kagarn, then at Ezra. "Even the Dwarves understand that following honor to the poitn of foolishness is, well, foolish." SHe speaks, as if quoting someone she had heard before, "Though, I'm not sure what we will do if plans go horribly awry."

Kagarn rubs his chin. "It is still a dangerous game. I will admit that we are no _worse_ off than if we allowed the naga's plans to come to fruition naturally. But our - well, _my_ entire purpose on this quest has been to _thwart_ the naga plans." He regards Ezra warily. "And what of your rogue Forsaken?"

Ezra smiles. "I wass wondering when you'd ask about them. Sso, yess, the naga need the Forsaken. Our alchemical knowledge iss.. ah, unsurpassed, yess. You recall the night elvess who could not be cured by Dhelgren the Purifier? The product of a Chalice improved by the Forssaken. So cutting the naga off from ssuch a resource is obviously of value to us." He pauses. "You musst understand. They do not love the naga - have no reason to love the naga. What they want iss a place in their new world order. A place without the living on the ssurface. But they remain what they are. What I propose to give them iss.. what they really want."

"And you know what they want better than they do," Kagarn observes, some of his wry wit returning along with a faint smile.

"It iss what we all want. We are all the same." Ezra holds out his hands. "We want acceptance. We want a place. We want not to be hated." He thrusts his bandaged, blackened, burned hands forward. "Look at them, tauren. _Look at them_, and tell me you have no feelings of revulsion at all."

Nerai looks at Ezra, "You offer many choices as simply one thing or the other, where many exist. I cannot look at you in revulsion. And I doubt any of us who travel together do. Acceptance is a wonderful thing, BUt first must come accepting."

"You ssaw our efforts and sacrifices to the night elves' cause," the wizard answers coldly. "Sstill we were met with hosstility when we traveled. The Forsaken will not become the sslaves of the living just to gain their approval, no."

Kagarn appears to be contemplating; his original _emotional_ reaction to Ezra's plan has cooled somewhat. "You are saying, then, that your estranged kinsmen act as they do because they despair of the living ever accepting them?"

"If even a Titan cannot cure the plague of undeath, I doubt an Old God's followers can," replies Ezra, reasoning it out. "If not the removal of this cursed state, there are not enough perssonally desirable goals to attract all of the apothecaries who have turned unfaithful, no. They musst have a shared goal. Temporal power iss one, yes. Acceptance is another. Either way, I can give them both - without the necesssity of alliance with those ssea-witches, yes."

Nerai thinks on this for a second. "However, if we were to poison, say, a very small number of their order. Enough that not much would be spent to overcome them, could they not be simply convinced of their goal being ninety degrees to the Naga?"

Ezra shakes his head. "The Crussade will blame the Scourge - or us, they don't disstinguish between the two - for any ssuch act. They will continue to sslaughter uss indiscriminately, yess."

Nerai looks at Ezra, "You sounds pretty sure of your self." She looks at Ezra, "Perhaps your council is wisest."

"One last question," Kagarn says. "What end do you hope to accomplish of all this? The unfaithful Forsaken brought into the fold - that you have said as much. But what of the Crusade? They will not _all_ die in their internecine warfare. What do you intend for them? After all, they too seek only to protect their homes and their loved ones. And you must admit - it is not so easy to distinguish your kind from the Scourge, if one does not know you personally."

"I intend for them to flee to the Plaguelands," answers Ezra, gesturing to the east. "Let them pass the Bulwark. Let them stay there. Let _them_ confront those loved ones and defend those homes when the naga come to their beaches. Let _them_ experience the horror of a creeping corruption. Only now, Kagarn, they will _know ahead of time that which they face_."

"Mmm," Kagarn says contemplatively. "I still have my misgivings, mage. I must meditate upon this matter. You may see a clear path before you, but I do not - yet."

Ezra just laughs.

The search for the 'associates of Timothy Lammas' does not take long. One of the larger mausoleums - and therefore one with little more than a lingering odor of the grave - doubles as an inn for the tiny handful of living travelers that pass through the Sepulcher; the innkeeper's eyes glow slightly brighter at the name. "Ah - we've been expecting you," he says. Then his parchment-thin lips lower in a frown. "And who are these?"

"They are the other associates of Timothy Lammas," replies Ezra curtly. "We're having a reunion, yesss."

The innkeeper studies Ezra's bandaged face. "We had _intended_ this to be a matter dealt with amongst the Forsaken alone. Does Timothy Lammas insist upon this entourage?"

"What you intended and what is to happen are unlikely to coincide," the wizard answers with a smile. "Nevertheless I am here to give you what you want. And these two are necessary to the success of my plan. So let uss not waste more time, no."

"You are a hard bargainer," replies the other. "Let us continue this discussion somewhere more privately." He turns and leads the way into another part of the crypt.

The chamber to which the innkeeper leads them has no other exit; torches blaze in their niches, and the slabs which once held the dead now hold drifts of paperwork, as does a marble desk. "I am known as Bates," says the innkeeper. "I assume you have heard of my dearly departed brother, Daniel." He chuckles dryly. "First, you who call yourself Pyreborn, know that Timothy Lammas is not merely a code. It is the name of your living self."

"When Daniel made his 'departure' from the vale of tears that is the Undercity, he took with him the records of others he thought would be amenable to his cause - including yours, as you were once a close associate of his. Alas, we did not reckon upon your amnesia." Bates sits down at the desk, waving at a nearby bench in an offer of seating to his guests. "So in order to speak to you on more amicable terms, we used the one memory you seem to retain."

"Ahh yes," hums Ezra. "Very well. You sspoke of my family. Where are they?"

"I fear I must tell you that they are being kept at the Scarlet Monastery," replies Bates.

Ezra leans forward ever so slightly. "And do you _control_ Scarlet Monastery?" he asks calmly.

"We do not - yet," is the answer. "But we do plan to strike very soon. Which is more than the Dark Lady has done thus far," he adds, sounding exasperated.

Ezra rocks backwards on his heels, clasping his hands behind his back. "I ssee. And sso this talk of my family was... little more than a calling card, to introduce yoursselves to me?" he continues. "Becausse if you have no hold on them, you have no hold on _me_."

Bates stares blankly at Ezra, then sighs. "So once again we deal in language of power and control, then? I thought _you_, of all the Forsaken, would be above such things."

"You musst understand something," says Ezra, glancing at Nerai in particular as he speaks. "Thiss family you speak of... I remember that I have such a thing. But how can I trusst that? I do not remember names, faces, voices. Only .. impressions. Whatever you think you have disscovered, I cannot ssimply take your word for it. Esspecially given your ah, track record of perfidy so far." He gestures around him. "Here you sskulk and hide, plotting an attack that even the massed forcess of the Undercity would be hard pressed to accomplish. I ssuppose you think that the naga's Chalice will give you an advantage, eh? You'll poison their water supply, take them over, ssomehow deliver them into the claws of those sea witches?"

"Would you prefer them to continue to assault our settlements with impunity, then?" snaps Bates, rising. "Just last week, we weathered a raid upon Brill. Twelve Forsaken were returned to the grave for good, and three more were taken! If your former family does not motivate you to aid us, then what of your new kinsmen? What of us?"

"What of you, ahh. What of you." Ezra paces. "Do you know who you're really working for, Bates? The Old God, Dagun? One of the five creaturess ssealed away when thiss world was shaped by the Titans? The cursed Highborne elves, thrown into the ssea and transsformed by that power, tainted and turned into the naga you now know? You think they would have compassion for you? Eh? When the Scarlet Crusade marched into the ssea to serve their new masters, it'd not be the last you ssaw of them. The Forssaken would die on their blades when the naga rose up. They have no _reason_ to spare you, us, anyone."

"It is not so simple as that, Timothy," replies Bates heatedly. "We know the naga are not suddenly great lovers of the Forsaken. But we had to do _something_. And the naga have already helped us, by providing the plague Chalices. Without that additional data, we would never have been able to create a disease that would infect even the Crusade's paladins." He smiles thinly. "Naturally, the naga would be most interested to discover how much progress we have made already."

"Naturally. And sso you decided to give an improved weapon to a force which threatenss the entire world, including the Undercity?" Ezra cackles. "Oh yess. What great thoughtfulness for your 'new kinsmen'." He holds up a hand. "Lissten closely. I am prepared to help you. But undersstand something. I am not working for you. You are working with me. In return, I will give you victory over the Scarlet Monastery. And the Crusade. Tirisfal Gladess will be ours. But not as allies of the naga."

"It will suffice," replies Bates. "For now, it will be enough that you do not seek to actively _undermine_ all of our efforts. Perhaps my brother will be able to convince you that we have a plan to deal with the naga as well, when the time comes." He glances at the living beings, still remaining silent on their bench, and his eyes flare with a pale corpselight.

"I assume a plague of some sort," remarks Ezra, deadpan. "If sso, I am well ahead of you. You see, Bates, I thought to come here and join your group. Find out your plans. Ever ssince your agents ssounded me out on Kalimdor." He gestures to Nerai. "I was about to complete that plan, when this goblin reminded me of ssomething I'd forgotten. Look at her. She's short, yes? A tiny little thing in a very large, very dangerous world. I tell you this, right now: She stands taller than all of us. With her help, we will achieve victory."

Nerai looks at Ezra curiously, but says nothing for now.

The innkeeper's eyes brush over Nerai briefly. "You would put our hopes in the hands of a goblin? Now you intrigue me."

Nerai glares at the innkeeper, "There are many, some of whom Ezra has helped, who would, and have, said the exact same thing about the Forsaken."

Ezra chuckles. "Here is truth: to infect the Crusade entirely would ssimply empower the naga's land forcess more. We will.. but no, let uss convene more of our like-minded allies to discuss thiss matter. I ssee no reason to delay, but we musst do this properly. We will use the weapons of the naga without becoming their allies of convenience - because convenience never, ever lasts."

"Very well," says Bates. "Return in your airship to the Undercity dock, then proceed to this point on foot." The innkeeper hands Ezra a scroll with a map of the Tirisfal Glades, indicating a point off the road due east from the Undercity, halfway to the Bulwark. "Secrecy is of the utmost importance, and it is difficult to conceal a zeppelin's movements."

"Very well." Ezra accepts the scroll, then pauses on his way out. "One last thing, Bates. I am loyal to Undercity. I am also loyal to the Forsaken. Even if you plot in ways the Dark Lady does not sanction, you are sstill one of us. And I promise you this.. at the end of things, the Forsaken will be a unified people. One way or another."

"We are counting on that," replies Bates gravely.

During their journey back to The Defiant, Nerai looks at Ezra, after we are well away from wandering eyes and inquisitive ears. "Thank you, Ezra. I believe this way will be of... more use to us in the long run, rather than doing everythign behind people's backs. Even if said actions will bring about their betterment."

Ezra reaches into his pockets and withdraws a sheaf of notes as he walks. He extends them to Nerai. "Take these back to your tinker friend," he says quietly. "It turns out I didn't need them. Ssay that I took them - which is true - and that you wanted to return them - which is also true. Perhapss you two may get on better than before."

Nerai takes the papers from Ezra. "Again, thank you, Ezra. I do hope, however, caht she will be friends with me..." She stashes the papers about her person, and the group makes their way back onto the deck of The Defiant.

As the party goes belowdecks, Kagarn emerges from his cabin, smiling - a wisp of sweet smoke wafts from behind him. "Ah, Ezra Pyreborn," he says cheerfully. "How went the meeting? Do you still plan on using the naga's plague to assault the Monastery?"

"Oh yes," Ezra replies.

"Good, good," replies Kagarn. "You'll be happy to know that the spirits smile upon your intentions. I'm now quite confident that you'll do the right thing, when it comes to it." He chuckles again.

Ezra makes a phlegmy coughing sound from the back of his throat. "Well defeating the Crusade with the power of friendship turned out to be impractical," he admits. "We'll be doing thiss other thing."

"Oh, don't count out the power of friendship," Kagarn replies. "It might be more powerful than you think, in the end. But for now you must proceed as you intend, oh yes." He grins and turns back into his cabin.

---

Ezra finds it easy enough to obtain another private audience with the Dark Lady, though this time it is in a different chamber. "So what news from the Sepulcher?" she asks.

"Three things," Ezra explains. "Firsst. Daniel Bates livess. Or, well, you know. Together they plot to attack the Scarlet Monastery." He withdraws the scroll and holds it up for inspection. "I go to meet with them at this place."

"I see," Sylvanas says, a long finger scratching her cheek idly. "And how do they intend to achieve victory? Your earlier reports indicated that the naga plague still does not affect paladins," she says, nearly spitting the word. "Or has Daniel succeeded in overcoming that limitation?"

"Oh, they had already begun to improve the Chalices even on Kalimdor," the mage continues. "Yess, indeed - that is what the naga wish of the Forsaken. Their experience as apothecaries and alchemistss. Which brings me to the ssecond matter. I intend to help them with their attack on the Monastery. For two reasons. One perssonal to me, and the other because I will not allow the Scarlet Crusade to become a fighting force under the command of the naga, no. Thiss was attempted at Tiragarde and thiss more than anything else represents an immediate danger to the Forssaken."

Sylvanas looks at Ezra contemplatively. "This does pose a difficulty to me," she says. "We have plotted to assault the Monastery ourselves, but had no plan that carried much hope of success. If Daniel Bates succeeds in breaking the Scarlet hold over the Glades - without the official help of the Undercity - it will make me look weak and ineffectual. And it will be difficult for me to use this knowledge without revealing who gave it to me."

"Thiss brings us then to the third matter." Ezra clasps his hands together. "You ssee, unless these men are fools - which I grant you is a possibility - their plan could not sstop at the overthrow of the Sscarlet Monastery itself. They musst have foresseen even as you did that your position would be difficult. I believe, my Lady, that they planned to depose you following their success, and I further believe that the apothecaries you had mentioned as remaining behind would be ssomehow instrumental in thiss task."

"And sso I believe that we should attempt to co-opt the conspirators _now_. I do not think their original plan will succeed. I have another plan, one which will deprive the naga of the Scarlet Crusade's forces while delivering Tirisfal Glades into our handss, yes."

"Indeed?" asks Sylvanas. "Will you tell me more of this plan of yours?"

"The Crusade seeks out and excises all taint within its ranks, my Lady," explains Ezra. "This plan to co-opt the leadership, especially those paladins resistant to the Chalice as it exists, is foolish. The laymen, the rank and file among the Crusade who lack this divine immunity, will of coursse become susceptible. But many within the Monastery will see their fellows have turned - in time."

"We will ambush a shipment of goods ssent to the Monastery by the nearby towers and farms they sstill defend. We will infect the caravaners. We will allow ssome to escape, bearing news to other Crusade settlements. By the time they investigate, the transformation within the Monastery will have begun."

Ezra smiles. "In other words, we will use the Scarlet Crusade's own nature against them."

Sylvanas nods slowly. "Whereas Daniel would infest the Monastery in secret, you would ensure that the rest of the Crusade discovers it - too late to prevent it, but in time to contain it. So that Crusader fights against Crusader..." She smiles. "Leaving us to pick up the pieces."

Ezra nods. "Jusst so, my Lady. And if survivors should reach Tyr's Hand, well.. That too is on the coast. They will know then what to expect, and will act as our shield against the naga from the east."

"I will need some time to contemplate this," says Sylvanas. "Nevertheless, I grant you leave to put your plan into action. Whether I remain on the throne of Undercity or no, our people must still live free of fear from those accursed fanatics. I will grant these renegades that much; their machinations have lent the Forsaken a powerful weapon against our foes." She smiles. "And once again I thank you, Ezra Pyreborn, for your invaluable service to me."

---

Nerai heads back down to the tinker Masjenal's shop. In her pocket she grips the papers that she intends to return. Rolf once said that those with right on their side have nothing to fear, but Nerai, remembering Masjenal's previous rage, does have much to consider as she files into the tinkers ship, unsure how she will be accepted again.

The goblin is right to be concerned. As she enters the shop, Masjenal turns, and her milky pale eyes almost seem to glow red. "You again?" she snaps. "What do you want _this_ time?"

Nerai pulls the papers out of her pocket, watching the dwarfs red eyes with more then a little fear. "I found my companion in posession of these. I know them to be yours. It is only right that they be restored to you." Nerai gulps and then tries the other gambit, "Also, I am intrigued by another of our way that has enjoyed the bittersweet 'friendship' of... that place..." Nerai, afraid to name it again.

Brightflame Masjenal steps round the counter and snatches the bundle from Nerai's hand. She glances over the first few pages, and her eyes widen. "We been lookin' fer these all over! Your companion - you mean Ezra? Why in th' hell did 'e take 'em for?" Her eyes narrow as Nerai goes on, though her rage is contained this time. "Now you listen to me, ye little green runt. Never speak ta me of 'that place' again, d'ye hear me? It's nothin' ta do with me, understand?" She stomps her foot soundly on the cobbles of Undercity. "This here's me home now!"

Nerai smiles at Masjenal. "And it's quite a fine home you have made here, as well. It seems very, homey to me, as well. Touches that make it seem familiar to places I have been in the past. And will return to once again." She looks, and breathes, "I can say I'm not really sure what he wanted with your papers, but I convinced him that possibly there must be another way then stealing that which isn't him." She sighs, and looks around the workshop, "So, what have you been working on lately?" A favorite topic of tinkers, to be sure.

Masjenal regards Nerai with narrowed eyes, as if wondering whether her speech was yet another reference to the hated Ironforge - but allows herself to be distracted by other considerations. "Ach, well, Ezra were always interested in a lot more 'n just his magic, anyhow. Probably some crazy political scheme of his." And to the question of her latest project, "Hah! Wouldn't ye like ta know," she says, grinning. "Well, I guess it ain't no great secret. I'm sure a goblin like you's heard of explodin' sheep, yes?"

Nerai smiles, "I have heard of them yes. Unlike most of my kinsmen, I'm not big on the whole 'huge explosions' thing. I have been known to cause one or two; but I have no love for them." Nerai look at Masjenal, "It is rough to judge one just by the color of their skin, yes?"

Masjenal actually laughs. "Or the shape o' their body, aye. Well... I been workin on a bit of a smart targetin' system for the things." She pulls out a set of what look like goggles along with a bewildering assemblage of gears - which looks rather like the gadget she'd been working on when she'd met Nerai. "Normally the things just goes after whatever's movin. I'm workin' on an optic recognition system. Course, right now half the time it just goes after somethin that's the same color as what it's lookin' for. Talk about judgin' ye by yer color, eh?"

Nerai smiles, "Hey, that is pretty handy." She smiles, and looks at the thing carefully, as Masjenal shows it to her, "Maybe I'll come back and have a look another time when it is more complete. Perhaps it can bu used for other things as well as sheep." She turns to go, and bows polightly, "I hope to make your aquantience again very soon, Ma'am." Masjenal waves Nerai on polightly, and the Goblin returns to The Defiant.

As Nerai leaves, Masjenal says, "Ye know, ye _are_ an odd duck fer a goblin. _Somethin'_ left its mark on ye. Someday, mebbe, I'd like to hear the tale. Just..." She looks to the south, where lie the dwarven lands of Khaz Modan. "Just not today."
