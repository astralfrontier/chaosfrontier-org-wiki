The quarantine cells at the Scarlet Monastery are as comfortable as regular quarters - the mattresses are thin but clean, as are the sheets. The bars and locks are the only sign that the occupants are not fully trusted to have the run of the Monastery.

Ezra's meal is brought to him by one of the Tide-touched conspirators. Quietly, the man whispers, "We've seeded the rations of the general mess. The sickness should begin spreading by tomorrow morning; we've got water barrels prepared to convert as needed." Ezra glances down at the tray. The Forsaken alchemists did their work well, but he can tell that the meal brought to him is from the tainted supplies brought in with the caravan.

Ezra pushes the tray away slightly. "I'm to succeed if this fails," he whispers. "They have to trust me." Glancing up at the turned Crusader, he smiles. "Do your jobs, so I don't have to."

The Crusader furrows his brow. "What d'you mean, sir?" he says, seemingly puzzled. Then light dawns, as he remembers the briefing outside the Monastery: Ezra must remain apparently clean to avoid arousing suspicion. "Ahh..." he says, tapping the chainmail around his throat. "I r'member now. We'll be sure ta bring ye meals from th'older supplies fr'm now on. May be a bit stale, but ya gotta keep yer strength up, y'know?" The man departs again, carefully bundling up and concealing the rations so that the guard on duty outside the cells won't remark on the missed meal.

Ezra sighs and leans back. It will be a new thing, this sensation. He has known hungers of every variety. But this one? Forgotten, for a time.

In the morning, breakfast is brought in. This time, the food is clearly past its prime, but fit to eat, and devoid of the taint of Dagun. "We had a stroke o' luck," reports the conspirator. "Got a senior officer fallen ill - guess he was extra hungry last night or somethin'. By evenin' we'll have 'im turned, an' then we have a hand in the duty rosters."

Ezra smiles broadly. "Perfect," he says, rubbing his hands together. "Here's what I want you to do..."

---

Crusader Havisham walks with a limp. Badly mauled in one of the campaigns fought in Lordaeron, his eating habits didn't slow down even though his body could no longer burn off the extra energy it was taking in. He's fought to keep himself in shape, worked to discipline himself despite an injury which resists treatment by the healers of the Monastery. The tainted flesh is too deeply ingrained, they say. Forever denied his old life, he's been taken in by those who share his fanatical hatred for the creatures which did this to him.

In spite of his dedication, he's still not fit for the rigors of recon duty - requiring instantaneous reactions and high speed to escape those more intact undead which might give chase or try to escape, or those all too human acolytes of the Cult of the Damned. And so now he looks for men like himself, men whom he can send to fight in his stead, and privately he glories every time one of them achieves success in the field. And privately he mourns like a son those who fall. And most of all he pities those who return maimed like himself.

"Listen to me," he tells his junior, when presenting the roster. "This Ezra fellow came from a long way away to meet our confessor. He's got spirit, man. Strength. That's what we're looking for! Of course he should go with them. Good test of fiber."

The junior crusader just shakes his head. "Sir, he just walked in off the road. We need more time--" Havisham silences this with a wave of one meaty hand. "Nonsense. Put him right into the thick of it early. Fire and a crucible, you know. That'll show us what he's made of. Right. And send along Confessor Lammas. You know, just in case. She'll have a handle on him. Family's a bond a man'll die for."

And so Ezra finds himself pulled out of his cell, roughly handed an iron-headed mace, and shoved out into the courtyard. "Over there, recruit," spits the sergeant. "You're goin undead huntin' today, you are." He sees Elaine, along with a number of well-armed soldiers. And he smiles to himself, as he looks at the gorgets many of them sport around their necks.

"Bow your heads in prayer," the confessor recites ritually. The soldiers comply, closing their eyes. Ezra does so as well. And while each man mouths his own simplistic wishes to some listening patron, the wizard mumbles a few choice incantations of his own.

The men rise, checking their weapons. "Open the gates!" goes out the call. The gates of the monastery open. The watchers above prepare their spears and bows. And the men go forth, to meet the undead.

This hunting party's route takes it amongst the trees, rather than along the main road - searching for signs of Scourge scouts rather than engaging them head-on. Once the party is well into the forest, Elaine allows the men to move forward, hanging back with Ezra. "I suppose you're wondering why Andrew is in Stratholme rather than with me," she says softly.

Ezra shrugs. "I wonder a lot of things, so I don't know where to ask," he admits. "So let's start with that."

The confessor seems to have something on her mind. After all, to whom can the confessor confess? "I didn't want to say anything about it on the grounds," she says. "But the truth is that my son... has been having doubts. He'd been working with the interrogators, you see. And this tale some of the Scourge keep telling, about them being free of the Lich King's will... well, he told me the story's hanging together too well." She shrugs. "What could I do? I told Whitemane, and she had him sent to Stratholme. To bolster his faith, they said."

Ezra rubs his chin. "So, well, maybe I don't understand too well, but... why would it matter?" he asks. "They're undead, right?"

"That's what I told him," Elaine says. "But the official word is that this 'Forsaken' business is just another Scourge plot. To keep us off our guard by trying to convince us that the Scourge is somehow faction-ridden. As if they were just like the living! Ridiculous! But... Andrew always had a good head on his shoulders, just like his father." Elaine gives Ezra another suspicious look.

Ezra nods thoughtfully. "I see. So, the idea is that they might have thrown off control, like the orcs did?" he says finally. "You heard this tale, right?"

"We don't worry about orcs too much anymore," Elaine says curtly. "Haven't seen any for ages. Last I heard for sure was about them escaping from the internment camps and heading west over the sea."

"Well you can't do business in Ratchet without knowing of that journey, and their new land of Durotar," explains Ezra. "It's just to the north. So it sounds like someone's trying to take that story and apply it to the Scourge, eh?"

"Oh, right," replies Elaine. "You've been traveling overseas. Well... anyway, Andy seemed to think there really was some kind of factional difference in the undead. I'm still not sure why he thinks it matters, but that's not what worries me right now. It's what they're teaching him up in Stratholme."

Ezra thinks a moment, staring about him at the dessicated forests of the glade. "Oh, I can see why," he murmurs. "You see... if any such creatures did regain themselves? I imagine your hatred of the Scourge would pale next to theirs. So obviously it's a trap. Because if they did exist, they'd be your best allies in the region. But if you seek such creatures out, they have you in their trap."

Ezra pauses and shakes his head. "Anyway. What are they teaching him?"

Elaine blinks at Ezra. "Right," she says at last. "Well, you know that Stratholme, in addition to our headquarters, is one of the biggest battlegrounds against the Scourge. We hold the city's cathedral, but the rest of the city is overrun. Well... apparently, there have been a few incursions by a group calling themselves the Argent Dawn. They've been raiding the undead-held areas of the city. And it's like you suggested just now; some of the people wearing the Argent Dawn's colors are undead themselves.

"We Crusaders, of course, believe that they're being deluded by the undead. Led into the trap you mentioned. Andy's sent me letters explaining the evidence that those undead are truly still working for the Scourge. But he's using our little code to tell me that he isn't buying a word of it." Elaine's brow furrows. "I'm worried. If he's wrong, I'm afraid he'll run off and fall into the hands of the Scourge himself. And if he's right..." The woman shudders, and brushes her hand across the Scarlet Crusade logo on her pauldrons.

Ezra smiles indulgently. "Well. Youth always knows best, right?" he asks.

"Very funny," Elaine says, not amused at all. "Now hush. We're officially in Scourge territory now. They could be on us any moment."

And since Ezra had had time to send a message to his companions, these words prove to be prophetic. There is the sudden roar of a steam engine coming to life, and Kagarn emerges from a cluster of young trees. "I'm afraid that your patrol will end here, Crusaders," says the tauren. No one else is visible, but Ezra knows that Saeren will not be far away.

"Don't just stand there - get them!" yells Elaine, drawing her sword. The other Crusaders likewise ready their arms.

Ezra smiles. "Minions of Dagun!" he calls. "Capture your brethren! None are to be harmed!"

Fully three-quarters of the patrol are Tide-turned. Swords swivel around to point at exposed throats, or poised at the joints in armor. Even Elaine is completely taken by surprise, managing to parry away one sword only to find two others at her neck. "Ezra! What is the meaning of this?" she cries out, horrified.

Ezra shakes his head. "We'll take them for conversion," he announces, ignoring the confessor for the moment.

There is a ruined keep not far off; so little of it remains that it has served as little more than a source of masonry for more recent construction. But part of the old stables are intact, and on Ezra's instructions, Nerai cobbled together a barricade to serve as a gate. The faithful but outnumbered Crusaders are herded into the cells easily enough, though Elaine glares bitterly at Ezra the whole way.

"Walk with me," says Ezra to the confessor, after arrangements are made. "If you run now, you will probably be killed. I promise you are in no danger with me, no matter what happens. All I ask is that you listen to what I have to say."

"You betrayed me," Elaine whispers. "You betrayed us. What more could you possibly have to say?" But she does step out of the cell and falls in beside Ezra, flexing and unflexing her hands.

"Daniel Bates told me the same thing," remarks Ezra. "You know Daniel?"

"How could I forget?" she snorts. "He was always jealous of you an- of Timothy and me. He was at Andorhal when the plague broke out. So I assume he's part of the Scourge now. Like you, I suppose."

Ezra just smiles. "I'm going to tell you a story. That story begins with an act of love, and ends with another one."

"Once upon a time there was a man called Timothy Lammas. You know, I don't even know who he was or what he did. But he had a wife, and a son I take it. He died, of the plague of undeath. His wife set fire to his body, to keep him from rising again as a mindless minion of the Scourge."

"She... almost succeeded. She thought she might have been too late, and she was. Somehow or another, the body wasn't wholly destroyed. Oh, burned terribly, nothing you'd want to look at, but humans are amazingly resilient things. It survived, and was reanimated. For a time, it was the vessel of the Lich King's will. Yes, for a time."

"It woke up. Became aware of itself, became conscious. Independent. Free-willed. It had no memories of its life, no name, nothing. Just one thing. A wife and child. It had been sent to kill a woman and her family in a village. It... stopped itself. _This is wrong,_ it told itself. And it went back and throttled the life out of the necromancer who'd given it this task."

"It remembered. It remembered being loved, and having kin, and wanting them to be safe. That's what broke the spell, you see. That inner fire."

"A likely story," Elaine says sourly. She looks around furtively, and her hands twitch again. "So where does this Dagun come into it?"

"Well now we come to that," says the wizard. "This creature needed a name. It knew nothing about itself except the lore it'd studied in the necromancer's tower. It took the name Ezra L. Pyreborn."

"Ezra had strong feelings about the living. He didn't resent them, as many of his fellow.. well, let's call them Forsaken, shall we? His fellow free-willed Forsaken, all of whom had come to their senses in their own ways. He had no memories of life to miss, nothing to grow resentful over. He was, in his own way, happy to be undead. It was all he knew. And so he traveled to Kalimdor, as part of an archaeological expedition. A place called Bael Modan."

"And there he learned of Dagun, one of the five Old Gods who have plagued the world. C'thun in Silithus, held at bay by the night elves a millennium ago, is one such. A survivor of the elves' war against him is shadowing us now, and will likely shoot at you if you run. Please don't provoke her."

"There was another, in the continent of Northrend. When the elves planted their World Tree there, its roots became entangled with that Old God, turned corrupt. They destroyed years of effort by thousands of druids rather than see that happen. So you see these Old Gods are nothing to be trifled with."

"Dagun, of the ocean, commands the naga. The transformed Highborne of this world's ancient history, and their own servants, the murlocs and other such creatures. They propose now to overrun the surface world. They wish to conquer it. Or reconquer it. The surface dwellers will fall before them. Sound familiar?"

"Oh, yes," Elaine says. "And what _also_ sounds familiar is that my Crusaders answered to 'minions of Dagun'. So all you've done is trade masters, then. Instead of serving the Lich King, you now serve this Dagun."

"I used them as tools to get you out of the Monastery," Ezra explains. "In about .. oh, eight hours, that tauren you met? Kagarn? He'll be ritually removing the taint of Dagun from them. They'll once again be their usual trigger-happy genocidal selves. They'll once again become my enemies, instead of my pawns, which is why we've got them locked up."

This actually shuts Elaine up briefly. "So... let me get this straight. You _pretended_ to serve this Dagun and converted our Crusaders. Then you pretended to join up with us. And now you're betraying the Crusade _and_ the Old God at the same time. Is there _anyone_ you're loyal to?"

Ezra nods. "Yes. To the thing I've always been loyal to. The memory of my wife and child. Because I stopped what would have otherwise happened, namely the death of a lot of my new kin, the total destruction of the Scarlet Monastery, and the corruption of all those within to Dagun's cause."

"I did what I had to do in order to save as many people as possible. Living or dead. Because nothing matters more to me than her smile."

"A strange tale," Elaine says, still plainly not believing it. "There's just one little hole. You told me that this creature who became Ezra... that his body was horribly burned. And yet _you_ are as whole as the day I met my Timothy. Explain _that_, Mister so-called Pyreborn."

"I will show you," says Ezra softly. "But you must be prepared for what you are going to see. You must be willing to see it. Are you?"

Elaine narrows her eyes. "I've seen a lot of things, _Ezra_. Everyone who survived the Scourge war has. I'm not afraid."

With a loud cry, Ezra's body explodes outward into sand. It takes several seconds before the howling dust converges back into the wizard's familiar form. Dressed as he was when he left the Monastery, and without bandages, his charred cadaver is unmistakeable. He holds out a hand.

Elaine flinches for a moment - but only a moment. "That... will do nicely," she says, her voice rigidly controlled. She looks down at the grayish hand, a few scraps of blackened skin still clinging to it, and then back up at the undead face. "How?"

"'How' what?" Ezra asks calmly. "By fire, yess. That sseems indicated."

"No, damn it," Elaine snarls. "By the Light, you really _are_ just as much a smartass as Timothy was. I _mean_, how did you manage to appear living?"

"'Appear'?" The wizard laughs, and now that he's in his undead state again, it's truly an unpleasant sound. "You ssaw. You tessted me yoursself, yess. By what monumental deception could I have fooled so asstute and rigorouss examiners, eh? There iss only one explanation. It wass no illusion. It was true. I am both alive _and_ dead, as I require, yess."

"That's impossible," Elaine retorts. "Even Whitemane can't resurrect a victim of the Scourge."

"Then explain it, yess," urges Ezra, gesturing with his hands.

Elaine shakes her head. "I can't," she says, beginning to tremble. "You know I can't. You and your living body passed every test we know. This is far beyond everything we know about the Scourge."

The undead shrugs. "Reason demandss that once you reach the limitss of your undersstanding, you admit new knowledge, yess. You are presented with a conundrum. A ssolution which fitts the observed factss is presented to you, yess. You cannot raise an objection, and your pressent position is, ah, untenable."

"I said earlier, Elaine, that our story endss with an act of love. You have sseen all the evidence I can present. You may sspeak with Daniel Bates, I hope, if you wish. He can tell you the fate that the Monastery would have suffered had I not intervened. And sso, I give you this choice." He sits himself down comfortably on the ground, then looks up. "You may do as you wissh from thiss point on, yess. I will not act against you. Flee from us, kill me, or stay to hear more. I will not resist. Because it iss your smile that I want most of all in this life. If I cannot have it, I had better die."

Elaine stares at the ravaged body which once belonged to her husband. Finally, she speaks, hoarsely. "Two things I ask of you now. Do those and we can talk more. First, free my men from Dagun's thrall as soon as you can." She turns away, trembling once more. "Second... turn back to your living form. Even if I know it's not the full truth, I don't think I can look at that any longer."

"Eight hours. I would have transsformed them no matter what you said," Ezra says calmly. He stands, once again enveloped and become the cloud of sand, and emerges from it a living man.

Elaine says no more, but allows herself to be led back to the ruined keep.

---

Back at the keep, Ezra introduces Elaine more formally to Kagarn and Nerai. "Friends, this is Elaine Lammas. She despises me and all my kind and thinks I ought to be slain." He pauses. "I ah, mentioned this is my ex-wife, right?"

Nerai's eyes brighten, and she bows rather formally in front of Elaine. Afte rthe bow, she reaches her goblin claw out to Elaine and smiles, "It is an honor to finally meat you, Ms." She looks Elaine over while other introductions are made.

Elaine glares briefly at Nerai - it's clear she's not in any mood to be courtly. Instead, she focuses on Kagarn. "So you're the one responsible for cleansing my men of their corruption," she says curtly. The shaman nods. "Good," she replies. "See that you do." And she settles herself beside the makeshift cell and closes her eyes.

Nerai looks back at Ezra, and shrugs.

Ezra smiles slightly. "She's had a rough day."

After half an hour, Elaine opens her eyes. "Hey, you," she says quietly. "The goblin... Nerai, was it?"

Nerai sits in Eecee, guarding the makeshift cell.. SHe looks over at Elaine, and nods, "Yes." She smiles, once again.

"How much are they paying you for this gig, anyway?" she asks.

"Well, I was going in at 80, but Ezra's a real ski-" She interrups herself in a fit of giggles. She clears her throat and shakes her head, "I'm not being paid." She pauses for a second to consiter her answer, "We're doing good work. Ezra helped figure out how to reverse the plague, you know..."

"Not being paid? You _are_ a goblin, right?" Elaine says, furrowing her brow. About the plague, she says, "Yes, I know. He showed me. I still can't believe he's managed to become living again."

Nerai nods, "You felt the claw. There's just more important things in life than money." She shakes her head. "That's amazing, I know. I did, however, mean the plague that affected your own men. The disease of Dagun."

Elaine's eyes widen. "A Scourge victim who doesn't obey the Scourge, working with a goblin who doesn't care about money," she says. "What next? I suppose your bull-man's some kind of super-educated genius, too?"

"It's a common misconception that we tauren are uneducated savages," Kagarn says. "It's just that our nomadic lifestyle did not lend itself well to the creation of libraries and other such accoutrements. That said, I will confess that I'm considered to be rather long-winded even among my own people."

Elaine stares at the tauren. "Light take me, he is. So what's weird about your night elf, then?" She's almost smiling.

Nerai shakes her head, "We all have our own little ways, don't we?" Nerai shrugs, "Ezra, among all the people i have traveled with, know how to see who you are within, rather than who you appear to be. It might be because of who he is. But it is refreshing."

The confessor rubs her chin. "It's definitely who he is. Timothy was like that too." She sighs, and then peers at one of the Crusaders in his cell; now that the jig is up, most of them have removed their gorgets and their gills are visible. "So... this thing Dagun has is a disease, is it? Lovely. Just what Azeroth needs - _another_ plague that enslaves the minds of its people."

Nerai says simply, "Rolf used to say that there is always evil to fight. Prepairing for war is no evil, in and of itself. It is what you do with that preperation."

"Who's Rolf?" Elaine asks.

Nerai looks at Elaine, "Oh, forgive me. Rolf was my teacher in Ironforge. A tinker, like myself." SHe looks down at Eecee, "A very honorable dwarf..."

Elaine nods. "It sounds like he was quite the inspiration for you," she says. "I haven't met _many_ goblins, but most of them, when they say 'honorable', they say it as if it's pronounced 'gullible'. But you don't."

Nerai nods. "I certainly know what you mean. For the record, I feel as dirty as the next person when they look at me to figure out how much money I've got on me. And I know how they do it." She smiles at Elaine.

Rather than returning Nerai's gaze, the human looks down at her feet. "This may seem like a strange question, but... has Ezra ever spoken to you of 'the glory of death', or anything like that?"

Nerai shakes her head, "No.." She says thoughtfully. "Why? Should he?"

She looks up again, with a wry half-grin. "You haven't spent much time in Lordaeron, have you? It's all the Cult of the Damned can talk about." She scuffs the dirt with a toe. "Maybe my son was right about this Forsaken thing after all." There's a grumbling from some of the uncursed Crusaders as she says this.

Nerai smiles, "Ezra certainly isn't recruiting. At least, not for death."

"We are recruiting everyone who doesn't want to be the thrall of Dagun!" calls Ezra from some distant corner. Since Kagarn delivered a bundle of papers, some ink and a quill from the _Defiant_, he's been furiously sorting through them, collecting, reading, and writing.

Nerai quips, "He also says very pleasant stuff like that from time to time..."

One of the Crusaders comes up to the bars. "Milady Lammas! Surely you aren't falling for this Scourge propaganda, are you? Look at what he's done to us!" he says, pointing out the gills on one of the other prisoners.

Elaine looks up at him. "If those gills are still there eight hours from now, tell me that again," she says, softly but firmly. "Until then, please be quiet. I need to think."

This won't stand. Ezra gets up and stalks back to the compound. "Yes, it's a trick," he says, throwing up his hands. "All this is some huge Scourge trick. That's why everyone here is still alive, why I'm calmly studying the intricacies of _rath kebosh_ and arcane transpermutations over there instead of feasting on your innards. It's a trick. Because, honestly, when have the Scourge ever shown compassion for the living?" And he starts to stalk away again.

Elaine says quietly to the dissenter, "He has a point. Since when have the Scourge been anywhere near this subtle?" The other Crusader looks dissatisfied, but returns to sulking.

---

The Dagun-infected bear their lot stoically for the first few hours. Four hours in, they begin pestering Ezra for water; Kagarn supplies it for all who ask, but the infected spit it out - after all, it is _fresh_ water that the shaman provides.

By eight hours, the infected are clearly suffering, their gills beginning to flare as they beg for salt water. Kagarn walks up to the first of them and calls upon the spirits to cleanse them of illness, and Elaine marvels as the gills close up and the Crusader's eyes seem to clear.

The other infected, witnessing this, become alarmed, shouting imprecations at Ezra for 'betraying the will of Dagun'. The menace of Nerai's rifle is needed to get them to stand still long enough to take their medicine; and soon all the occupants of the cell are in possession of their own will once more.

Ezra directs his most burning question to Elaine, in the hope that she'll convince the Crusaders to answer. They seem unlikely to talk to him. What he wants to know is simple: did they have any awareness of what the will of Dagun _is_, over and above what they were told by Asprah?

Elaine herself is no longer quite as trusted as she once was, but she prevails upon them, if nothing else, to recall that there is now a _new_ plague at work in Lordaeron, and that the Crusade must know everything they can about it. Eventually, they acknowledge this, grudgingly.

The answers are consistent: while under the influence of the plague of Dagun, they were apparently gripped with a loathing and pity for all who breathe air, and a desire to 'help' others become fit for the day when Dagun would envelop the world with his waters. At no time did this overwhelming emotion provide any _specific_ guidance; instead, they listened to whoever seemed to have a plan that would bring this about. Their first sign that Ezra was not one of them was when he'd had Kagarn and Nerai imprison them as well as the untainted Crusaders.

"Well," says Ezra finally, after digesting all this. "Now you boys know how I felt."

There is some puzzled mumbling amongst the Crusaders. It is Elaine who voices the question they're all thinking: "What do you mean?"

Ezra smiles sadly. "Those undead you kill? The Scourge, and the Forsaken as well? They're the men and women of Lordaeron. They're your brothers, sisters, husbands, wives. They're your sons and your fathers. Neighbors, friends. Trapped in a shell they can't control. Only sometimes they can come back. It's like swimming to the surface of a lake after you've been drowning in it for a century. Only _then_ you fools come and kill us off anyway, because you don't bother to tell the difference." He pauses, and his eyes grow alight. "Do you have _any idea_ how hard it was to stop them from killing you all?"

The mumbling is mixed this time. The phrase 'Scourge propaganda' is audible every so often, though much less frequently among those who had been infected. Elaine herself seems to be listening to Ezra intently.

"Here is what is to happen." Ezra sighs. He knew this would come; he knows now that this may break the tenuous tie he has with Elaine. But it has to be said. "We infected _part_ of the Scarlet Monastery. We let a few go from a caravan. If we judge correctly, they'll be reporting to your other settlements that the undead have gotten some people inside the Monastery. Now a trained paladin can cleanse the taint, you saw it. What we need is for you people to get out of Tirisfal Glades, so we can defend it properly from the naga."

"Daniel Bates was working for the naga. He had other plans. You were _all_ to be turned. All of you, every last one, would have been infected, with a taint that could even possess a wielder of the Light. And you would have all marched willingly into the sea to serve the naga. I.. stopped that from happening. I betrayed everyone I knew to stop it. I had to, because.. because everyone should live. I want as many of you to survive as possible. Even if you hate me."

There is more whispered discussion. Over the top of it, Elaine says, "So you deliberately turned our fellow Crusaders against the Monastery - and you used a _real_ menace to do it. Do you hate us living people that much?"

"I suppose you'd have just calmly turned your attention to the naga on your _very shores_ if we'd sent an emissary to your gates?" asks Ezra.

Nerai looks at Elaine, "You know, you talk about the Scourge hating the living so much, but the only one here who has shown or talk about hate is you and your men."

"Shut up, goblin!" snaps one of the Crusaders. "My entire family was slaughtered by Scourge zombies!" "Mine too!" says another. "I lost my only daughter to the Scourge!"

"I've lost friends too," says Ezra quietly. "To you people. Are you done?"

"Enough!" snaps Elaine, but she is facing her troops. "Have you even been paying attention to what happened here today? Yes, this man is clearly an enemy of the Crusade. But he is not an enemy of the living!" She gestures to Kagarn and Nerai. "Look at them. Have they shown _any_ signs of being cultists? Has this tauren not cured the ocean-plague?" She calms slightly. "You all have trusted me for years. And perhaps if I say this, you will trust me no more, but I must say it anyway. The Forsaken are real. There truly is a breed of undead that pursues their own destiny. True, some of them still hate the living. But there are others..." She turns to Ezra. "There are others who we may yet be able to bargain with." And she smiles.

Ezra lets out a long sigh, one that's been building in his mind for awhile. "I can redeem those Forsaken who hate the living. I think. I hope. But it had to be this way. I'll save as many of you as I can. But we needed you to stop killing us." He looks from face to face. "Please. Stay here for now. Let me keep you safe from what's coming. After that, go to your fellows. The safest place for you now will be Tyr's Hand, and your fortifications to the east. I won't stop you." He looks at Elaine a moment. "If that isn't enough, I have one more reason for you to leave these lands."

The Crusaders consider this for a while. There are some glares of resentment directed at Ezra, but one of them speaks up, "If there's one thing I do know about the Scourge, it's that _they_ don't keep prisoners of war." The tone of the mumbling changes for the better.

"You aren't prisoners any more," says Ezra softly. "You're.. guests. Conduct yourselves as guests and everything will be fine."

With no dissent, Ezra gestures to Kagarn and Nerai. "Let's let 'em out."

"Come on!" says one of them. "We need to warn the monastery! They're in terrible danger!" About half of the squad falls in behind them; the others, including Elaine, hesitate. "What are you waiting for?"

"If you go there, you'll just be infected," Ezra points out calmly.

"We've got to try!" barks the Crusader - a lieutenant, judging from his rank insignia. "Come on, milady!" Elaine shakes her head sadly. "No, William. I do not think my doubts would be welcomed by the Monastery. No matter who controls it."

Ezra steps forward. "If you leave, then save who you can. Good-bye," he says. And he extends his hand to the lieutenant. "And good luck."

The lieutenant glares at the hand, and spits on the ground in front of Ezra before departing with his reduced squad. The remaining men cluster around Elaine, who asks: "Where shall we go, then? The Undercity?" There is a general shaking of heads. "I didn't think so," she continues.

"I'd hoped you'd come with me, actually," Ezra says. "I intend to go to Ironforge and Stormwind next. Warn the southern kingdoms about the naga. I'm thinking about a detour to Stratholme now, to be honest. But... your way is your own."

Elaine looks around at the men who follow her. "I don't think my men are comfortable traveling with the undead, yet. Not even one of the Forsaken. But if you are headed to Stratholme, perhaps we will meet again soon. I will lead my men through the Plaguelands. We can't give up the fight against the Scourge, but... perhaps the Argent Dawn will take us in."

"Tell them everything I've told you," suggests Ezra. "If I'm able to find Andrew and get him out, I'll bring him to the Bulwark."

"Of course." Elaine steps forward, and takes Ezra's hand. "I wish you could remember Timothy better. But I'm glad that some part of him lives on. Take care... Ezra Pyreborn."
