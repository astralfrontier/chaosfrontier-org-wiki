There's a small knot of Forsaken citizens who are gathered near the eastern walls of the city of Lordaeron. Zeal looks them over from his hiding place, adjusts his jaw, and lopes through the forests and toward the group.

A few of the Forsaken are holding torches. They raise them aloft as Zeal draws near. A few gasp; Zeal glances down, realizing that his tabard might have looked too much like the Scarlet Crusade's in the twilight. He holds out his hands and steps into the glare of the torches. His rotting features send a wave of visible relief across the crowd.

"Who are you?" one of the undead asks.

Zeal nods in greeting. "I'm a member of the Arg-u-ent D-ugh-awn," he says. "Word-uh came t-ug us that s-ugh-thing was gu-oing on here. I'm su-ent to inv-u-stigate."

"Yer jest in time ta become human," cackles one of the Forsaken - a dwarf, which gives Zeal some pause.

"There's the signal," another calls, and the group begins to move away from the wall and into the forest. Zeal follows curiously.

The Forsaken emerge into a clearing. The most notable features are an enormous pit dug into the earth, along with a stone pillar at the center of it. At the top of the pillar sits the wizard that's caused such a stir in the Undercity, Ezra L. Pyreborn. The pillar is at least twenty feet high; the stone surface is sheer and unclimbable.

When the undead have finished gathering around the edge of the pit and staring across the gap at Ezra, the wizard finally speaks. "All those who wissh to learn of the Ssacred Fire sshould join me here, yess!" he calls, gesturing to the pillar top.

The more adventurous souls among the Forsaken slide down the incline into the pit, staring up at the pillar. They glance around, surveying the situation quietly. No rope seems in evidence, nor steps, nor any other way to ascend the pillar.

"Hey. How do we get up?" demands one at last. Ezra laughs back down at him, but no further solution is forthcoming.

A few more minutes pass. Some of the Forsaken make attempts at the pillar. There's not enough rock and wood to build anything high enough to climb all the way to the top. The stone defies all climbers. One member of the troupe, an arcanist, finds his levitation magic immediately dispelled by Ezra, who otherwise has not involved himself in the matter.

Zeal watches this with growing amusement. Then he sucks in a long breath. He glances up at the cackling wizard. He looks at the mob, individually throwing themselves at this problem. He opens his mouth as far as his distorted jaw permits, which is considerable.

"FORSAKEN!"

It's the loudest sound some of these creatures have heard come from a humanoid throat. As one they stop and turn.

Zeal grins. "You, you and you!" he announces, pointing out individuals from the group and positioning his own body in demonstration. "Stand flus-ugh to the wall! Now!" They hesitate. "NOW!" he barks. This time they move.

"You and you. Get on their s-ugh-ulders. Lean in a-gu-st the wall. You three, help them up. The res-u-t of you, pus-ugh!"

The crowd reluctantly complies - not out of hesitation, but out of confusion.

"The rest of you! Start scaling. When you get up there, turn around and pull the others up!" Zeal rubs his hands together; he's beginning to enjoy this. He gets in there himself, pushing corpses upward, taking a foot to the face every so often as one person or the other ascends the pillar.

A couple of minutes are enough. By this time the unliving scaffolds are enjoying their roles, actively shoving their fellows up the side of the pillar. The rest are at the top and have turned around, hands out stretched.

Zeal shakes his head and lets out a gurgling laugh. "Tenacity, right?" he calls up. "Your fir-ug-st lesson?"

It's Ezra's turn to shake his head. "Fire!" he calls cheerfully. "Same thing."

The Crusaders who escaped from Ezra's 'ambush' are quick to raise the alarm... but not quick enough. Even by the time they return, a goodly third of the Scarlet Monastery's footsoldiers are infected, and they were prepared. Within hours, outright war is taking place within the Monastery's walls.

The Forsaken skirmishers, alerted by Ezra that the jig is up, disappear into the woods, allowing the outlying Crusaders to reach the Monastery just in time for the infected to gain control of a few of the fortress's siege engines. The three-way battle is bloody and vicious, especially since the Crusade was ill prepared to besiege its own monastery on such short notice.

By contrast, the Forsaken - first through Daniel Bates' conspiracy, and later under the official auspices of the Undercity - have been preparing such an assault for months. As the battle between the living dies down, the dead have their day. A wave of abominations charges across the battlefield, trampling all in their wake, and taking advantage of the few breaches that the Crsade's rescue expedition had managed to make; gargoyles swarm the towers and overwhelm the undermanned air defenses; and banshees, taking advantage of the chaos, possess Crusader soldiers in the midst of their own defense.

One other long-running rivalry receives a few more decisive battles to add to its record: the competition between the Scarlet Crusade's healers and the Undercity's cadre of experienced necromancers. One way or another, fallen corpses are going to be filtering their way back into the ranks of the armies today.

The battle rages throughout the night, and no quarter is expected on either side - although, to the Crusaders's surprise, quarter is given. On orders from Sylvanas (who has heeded the counsel of Ezra Pyreborn), the Forsaken marauders do not slaughter their foes to the last man. Whenever a group of Crusaders is sufficiently outnumbered, they are disarmed, bound, and hustled into courtyards and dungeons. The surviving Crusaders are not heartened by this - fearing that they are to be turned into undead, they fight all the harder - but despite their best efforts, more and more of their number are captured.

An hour before sunrise, the battle is all but over. Only the Cathedral itself remains in Crusader hands, and overwhelming numbers of the not-so-mindless undead wait for the order to take the keep.

Ezra asks for Saeren to accompany him. After surveying the intelligence reports, he also asks that arcanist Doan be taken from the captives and brought to him.

With that, the wizard and a small cohort of guards set out for the Cathedral, under flag of truce. Ezra's privately curious to know if the remaining Crusade will honor it, but he hopes that Doan's presence will at least make them think about it.

The courtyard of the Cathedral is deserted until the gates of the Cathedral itself are reached. Waiting there is a small force of infantry in defensive positions behind a handful of overturned carts, with a few arcanists in defensive positions. As the Forsaken approach, bows are drawn, but their lieutenant cries, "Hold!" He peers from behind the inadequate barricade. "What is this? The Scourge comes to parley?"

"We're not the Sscourge!" calls back Ezra. "But yess. Go and tell whoever livess inside."

As Ezra speaks, Doan straightens up sharply, causing his rune-encrusted manacles to jingle. "Lammas!" he blurts out in shock. "How can this be? You were alive! Every test proved it!"

"You hush," remarks Ezra curtly. "We'll get to that in a moment."

There is no other response from the barricade, although there are some whispered orders, and eventually a lone Crusader leaves the safety of the barricade to approach the Cathedral gate, knocking on it and speaking through the spyhole that snaps open in the wicket gate. There is a brief conversation, and the private scurries back to safety again.

Minutes pass, before another voice speaks from beyond the gate - a male voice, clearly used to command. "I am Commander Mograine of the Scarlet Crusade," he calls. "Why should we parley with the Scourge?"

"Do you want to live?" calls back Ezra.

"Do you take us for fools?" retorts Mograine. "You only want to make sure our bodies are intact enough for your foul necromancy! If you want our corpses so badly, come and take them, if you dare!"

"We could have just attacked already," points out Ezra. "Doan lives and stands beside me. Other of your Crusaders still live. As many as we could spare. They have not been killed. They have not been turned." He pauses. "Doan, tell these people where you were kept."

Doan glances quizzically at Ezra one more time, but calls out nonetheless. "They took the library in great numbers. We had no chance - they shackled me and my assistants and kept us locked in the nearby chambers." He pauses, then yells again, more heartfelt this time, and speaking as quickly as possible as if fearing he will be interrupted. "Mograine! They can appear as the living - undetectable! Someone needs to escape and warn the Crusade!"

"Yes, a word on that. But come out and talk like civilized men," adds Ezra, nodding encouragingly to Doan.

There is silence from the gates for several minutes. Eventually, the voice of Mograine calls out again. "If Doan's words are true, why did you allow him to speak?"

"Come out and I'll tell you," is the wizard's sly answer.

Changing tactics, Ezra speaks again. "I know you're confussed, frightened, angry. Many of your men have died, or turned againsst each other. There wass a war here. We won. But we don't want to kill you, or turn you. There iss this new thing happening. I want you to be a part of it. I want you to ssurvive. I'm _counting on it_ in fact. But I need you to come lissten, yes."

After a few more minutes of silence, the wicket gates open, and a man emerges, auburn-haired and bearded, and resplendent in the finery of the Scarlet Crusade. Beside him is a woman, less heavily armored, and with hair so pale it is almost white. "We will come," calls Mograine. "But if we do not return to the Cathedral within an hour, the remaining Crusaders here are ordered to fight to their dying breath."

Ezra nods. "And now, let uss dispense with the mosst important thing you musst know about us," he says, gesturing at Doan. "What thiss man says is true. But..." He pulls back the bandages of his face to reveal the undead flesh beneath. "I am not of the Sscourge. Nobody here is of the Sscourge."

The wizard's body howls into the familiar cyclone of dust, and recombines into the living form he has used before. The form he can only use for one purpose: the redemption of others. "Doan examined me when I infiltrated your Monastery the other day," he announces. "Sir, please be good enough to brief Mograine on your findings."

The surviving Crusaders - including Doan - react in shock and astonishment to this transformation, just as with everyone who has witnessed it. Doan is the first to recover. "Milord," he says, "it is as this... this being says. He came with the story of being kin to Elaine Lammas. Not believing him, she had me subject him to every test I knew, arcane, alchemical, medical. Elaine herself attempted to wield the Holy Light against him. In all respects, he seemed to be living. No illusion magic, not even a taint of undeath or disease." A brief pause, then Doan poses a question to Ezra. "What happened to Elaine?"

"She lives. She travels, along with several other Crusaders in the patrol you sent out," Ezra explains. "She was once my wife, you know. Not now, of course."

The Crusaders listen to this exchange in suspicious bewilderment. Mograine asks gruffly, "Does she know you are undead, then?"

Ezra laughs. "Oh yes. She reacted about the way you did just now."

The Crusaders exchange glances. Finally, Mograine speaks. "If you aren't going to slay or turn us, what _do_ you intend?"

"Here are the terms of surrender offered by the Undercity," says Ezra, now sounding more formal. "You will leave Tirisfal Glades. You will travel east, through the Bulwark, to your holdings in Hearthglen or Tyr's Hand or wherever. You will not return in force. If at such time you wish to have peaceful contact, we will receive an emissary from you and promise him safe return."

"You may fight the Scourge there, however and whenever you wish. But you must acknowledge that _we are not the Scourge_. We are our own people. And the reason that I highly recommend you take these terms is simple." Ezra looks from face to face. "Elaine made the choice I now confront you with. Soon, all the Forsaken will be capable of adopting a living form. And so you have only two real options. First, to see us as human - to distinguish between the free-willed undead and the mindless Scourge. Or second, to commit genocide upon every living human you find in Tirisfal Glades. Because any of them could be us."

"If you are not complete monsters, you will take the first position."

Saeren at last breaks her silence, "And if by your conduct you prove yourselves to be complete monsters, the forsaken will not hunt alone."

Mograine turns to Whitemane and the two have a very brief whispered conference. Finally, the Scarlet commander turns back. "So be it," he says hoarsely. "You will return our arms as we enter the Plaguelands, then? The undead there make no pretense at being other than the Scourge."

"Of course," says Ezra. He thinks of something, then withdraws a sealed envelope from his pocket and presents it. "There's something else you should know. The Naga, and the Old God Dagun. Their power is what infected your Crusaders. A paladin can cleanse the infection with the Holy Light. Here is everything you need to know about them. Take this to your leadership."

"That foul plague!" snaps Whitemane, who looks drawn and haggard. "You taunt us with these claims of a cure! I spent _hours_ trying to treat the poor souls you tainted!"

"Oh that," Ezra answers. "Keep them off salt water for half a day or so. Then try again."

Whitemane narrows her eyes, then sighs. "An insidious plague, that. Just like your kind - even if you borrowed it from another."

"Yes. Just like our kind," Ezra replies evenly. "All the more impressive, then, that we've shown you mercy, yes?"

Mograine snorts. "Let's get it over with." He calls out to the rest of his men. "Crusaders, stand down! These undead have discovered a new game, and we're going to play along for now."

---

Ezra's solution to the problem of Scarlet Monastery may have resulted in the least loss of life, but the body count is still high. Three quarters of the Crusaders, both inside and outside the Monastery, lost their lives; the Forsaken losses were fewer, but many of the undead were still destroyed beyond all repair.

Commander Mograine asks his captors for permission to create a funeral pyre, and to his astonishment, the request is granted. The fallen of the Crusade, along with enough wood to build a siege engine, greet the rising sun with a blaze that could be seen from the Undercity, and a column of smoke that can be seen for miles beyond. Few of the Crusade are truly moved to sympathy for the Forsaken even now, but all are astonished that the undead would willingly give up so many bodies that could have otherwise been used for necromancy.

It is almost noon before the pyre has burned down, and only then are the Crusaders willing to depart, under heavily armed escort. A caravan guarded by the Forsaken bears the arms, armor, and supplies needed for the Crusade to reach safety; the infected Crusaders, now cleansed once more, are more than willing to undo their attempts to taint the food stores.

And thus it is that the defenders of the Bulwark are astonished to find an enormous horde of humans, flanked by their Forsaken minders, marching upon the eastern border. Astonished, but not entirely unprepared.

Elaine Lammas, now wearing the tabard of the Argent Dawn, is among the first to greet the vanguard. "So the Scarlet Monastery has fallen at last," she says, seeming wistful. Her eyes look out over the ranks. "So few survivors..."

Ezra presents himself at the Bulwark and is duly directed in Elaine's direction. He too watches the Crusaders file past. But he still walks, and finds who he's looking for in due course. "Well?" he asks calmly.

"So few survivors," repeats Elaine. "But the fact that there are _any_... We all knew there was a possibility that the Monastery would fall someday. But none of us would have anticipated _this_." The column comes to a halt about the Bulwark, and the arms caravan marches past, through the gate into the Plaguelands.

Ezra nods. "Do you regret it?" he asks finally. "Letting me live. You could have stopped me."

"I don't know yet," Elaine says. "I still think I made the right decision, though." She nods toward a small cluster of Crusaders who, after looking around nervously at their fellows, have engaged another Argent Dawn member in conversation. "The battle against the Scourge goes on, as it must. The battle against the Forsaken... can wait."

"Well that's something," mumbles Ezra. "I came to say something else. This man Timothy Lammas is dead. You've grieved already. I'm sorry if my presence re-opened a wound long closed. I am my own man, and I plan to remain as such. But.. that shouldn't ever stop you from deciding to make a new friendship, in the fullness of time." He turns, looking back the way he came, and takes a step.

"My heart is still uneasy, Ezra Pyreborn," Elaine says as he turns away. "I have not yet avenged my husband. But until then... should our paths cross again, I will happily fight by your side, as once I did with him."

Ezra nods. "Then good-bye. I'm off to Stratholme. You'll see your son soon."

As Ezra makes his way past, another cadre of Crusaders come up to speak with Elaine. It seems that today, the ranks of the Argent Dawn will swell greatly...

Nerai is at the helm of the Defiant, and signals the ground crew that she's ready to land, hovinger the ship down onto a clean touchdown on the landing pad. She exhales softly; They take the defiant everywhere, but it's always a bit nervious to pull it down.

Ezra comes aboard. He's staying in his living form for the present; his destination isn't that far, and he'd be shot on sight by both sides of the conflict there as one of the Forsaken. He approaches the controls, seeing Nerai, and calls out. "We're going to Stratholme," he says calmly. "After that, set course for Ironforge. I'll be talking to the leaders of the Horde during that time. In Ironforge, I'll be busy with my apprentices. Nerai, I need you to take over for awhile. You know what has to be done."

Nerai looks over to Ezra. She looks down, then up at him, "I... Yes." She nods, "We will continue." SHe looks back at Saeren, "I'll have some help."

Saeren joins Nerai and the others aboard the Defiant, where she is promptly greeted by Shade. The large cat carefully studies its rider, bumping noses and then sniffing thoroughly before taking his place at her side. "What is it we're doing?" asks Saeren.

"Right now? Saving my son," Ezra replies. "After that, warning the rest of the world."

"Why do I have a feeling when it comes to the Crusade, we're going from the frying pan right into the fire?" asks Saeren.

Ezra shrugs a bit. "Stratholme will be dangerous. But the Crusade won't attack us as we are, I think. I hope. Anyway, it'll all work out."

"If we didn't walk into danger, we wouldn't be the heros..." Nerai says.

"Very true, Nerai," says Saeren. "And I hope we won't be attacked. At least.. not too much at one time."

Argent Officer Garush approaches the vessel. "News of the fall of the Monastery will almost certainly precede your arrival at Stratholme, no matter how swiftly you fly. It's unlikely that the Crusade there will welcome you - only the most fanatical of their army dwell there. And I need not educate a Forsaken on the reception you'll get from the Scourge," he adds, nodding to Ezra.

"I need to get a man out of there," Ezra answers. "I'm open to ideas."

"Travel to Light's Hope Chapel," Garush advises. "Our people there frequently mount raids upon Stratholme. If you join in one of those, or at least coordinate with them, it will be easier for you to get into the Scarlet Quarter, whether you intend to use force or guile."

Ezra smiles. "Thank you, sir."

"We are indebted to you, Ezra Pyreborn," Garush adds. "The Scarlet Crusaders were never very willing to cooperate with us before. With several of them on our side, our chances of pushing back the Scourge into the Plaguelands improves greatly." Garush hands Ezra a silver token. "Give this to Commander Eligor Dawnbringer there. He will assist you however he can."

Ezra nods. "The Undercity has no quarrel with the Argent Dawn. I hope you'll find us more willing allies than the Crusade as well."

"We already have," Garush acknowledges. "We wish you luck in finally cleansing these lands of the Scourge," he says, nodding toward the Undercity. "And I wish you luck in Stratholme. You will need it. That city was abandoned by luck long ago."

Nerai nods, and clears with ground to take off. She looks down, as the Defiant takes to he air, her Goblin eyes darting across the control panel, watching the gages and dials that are the life blood of a pilot. She looks down, and turns the airship off to the Plaguelands. The Defaint swiftly flies through the air, off to it's next destination...
