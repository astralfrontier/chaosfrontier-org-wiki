The news of Andrew Lammas' return from the Scarlet Bastion - and rumors of the letters he brings with him - quickly have Light's Hope Chapel in an uproar. Maxwell Tyrosus is quick to call a meeting of the Argent Dawn's leadership council to debrief the young ex-Crusader and his rescuers.

As Lord Tyrosus reads the missives, Andrew delivers the summary, substantially similar to that which he'd given Ezra Pyreborn: the Grand Inquisitor of the Scarlet Crusade, Saidan Dathrohan, had been secretly pre-planning the entire war with the Forsaken, to no obvious motive except to promote chaos and hatred while preserving the existence of both.

At length, Tyrosus lays down the sheaf of papers. "This represents a most serious charge. It is undeniably Dathrohan's handwriting... and yet, it is totally unlike the man. Or at least, unlike the man I thought I knew, years ago. There _was_ a darkness on his soul when we parted, but _this_..."

Saeren looks at Tyrosus evenly, and replies, "Hearts can go very black, indeed, Lord Tyrosus."

"Underccity hass been .. informed of thiss," explains Ezra. "My contact there wass to pass thiss information on, and could give me no further newss. But thiss... this _waste_, this _needlessness_..." He slams the tip of his cane into the ground so hard it makes the paladin's wooden desk tremble slightly. "I will not stand for it! Whoever thiss man was, I will not countenance this!"

"I should have found him and put an end to it all myself," suggests Saeren.

Saeren has connected.

Saeren has disconnected.

Tyrosus looks at the cane, and then at Ezra. "There can be no doubt that you have more cause than most to be angry over this, Ezra Pyreborn. But please, calm yourself. If this is true, we must find some way to _deal_ with it. And that will not be easy. Dathrohan's most fanatic followers dwell in the Bastion, and we do not have the numbers to deal with them and the Scourge both."

Ezra narrows his glowing eyes. "I will tear down every sstone of that place with my own handss if I musst," he announces coldly. "But.. yes. The Forssaken endured a brief period of... internal dissent, yess. We have emerged from it sstronger. Sso must the human opponentss of the Ssscourge find themsselvess united in purpose once again. But men like this--" and here he waves his cane at the paperwork brought back "-- threaten that."

"So what should we do?" asks Saeren. "A stab in the night, or something else?"

"A frontal assault," says a voice by the door. A dry, dead voice - and yet, the members of the Argent Dawn snap to alertness as they hear it, and Tyrosus' eyes widen in astonishment.

"Inquisitor Fairbanks!" he exclaims. "But we thought you were-"

"Dead, yes," comes the reply. As he enters the room, it is clear that he _is_, indeed, dead - at least as much so as Ezra Pyreborn or Leonid Bartholomew. "Departed, no. As you can imagine, I had much unfinished business. Yes, restless dead in the catacombs of the Monastery itself, if you can imagine it. But not of the Scourge, whatever Dathrohan might have suggested." He seems to spit the name from dry, dusty lips.

"But I bided my time, yes. I may have been dead, but good sense had not left me, enough to avoid revealing my presence to an army of fanatic paladins." Fairbanks chuckles dryly. "I waited, and listened. What your young Lammas claims is true, and more."

The ex-Crusader nods to Ezra Pyreborn. "I am told that I owe you my freedom, sir. And I will tell you this: your call to the Undercity was not unanticipated. You see, the Lady found the other half of Dathrohan's correspondence, amongst the private papers of 'Lord' Varimathras." He beckons to the room's occupants. "Come, old friend. Let me show you how you shall breach the Scarlet Bastion."

Arrayed upon the lawn of Light's Hope Chapel is an army unlike any it has seen since the Third War. Rows upon rows of Forsaken soldiers, and a hardy contingent of Argent Dawn. And in front of both - "Mother!" calls Andrew, and rushes forward to clasp hands with Elaine. "Thank the Light you're safe!"

"The same to you, son," replies the Confessor, beaming. "I was afraid they'd kill you in there, after I turned..."

Ezra hobbles out, supporting himself on his cane, and watches the proceedings with glowing eyes.

"And thank you again, Ezra," she continues. "For saving both of us. But there is another here who is eager to talk with you..."

From the ranks of the Forsaken emerges another, dismounting from a skeletal steed and hobbling forward, much like Ezra - though his injury is much newer. It is Daniel Bates. "Useful tool, am I?" he says, grinning in that most unpleasant way that only a Forsaken can as he looks toward Stratholme. "I'll show _him_ useful tool!" Turning to Ezra, he adds: "Timothy, old friend, may I ask your forgiveness - and your help in showing Saidan Dathrohan why it is a mistake to deceive the Forsaken?"

"Timothy is dead." The voice is the reedy sigh it's always been. "Whatever bondss of friendsship you had with him are gone." Ezra looks up. "I sshould kill you for what you almosst did. Elaine... she wass to die, you know. I..." He turns away. He looks up at the chapel spire.

Daniel is silent for a while. "I... am sorry, Ezra," he finally says, at great length.

"Tell her," the wizard whispers. He clenches his staff. He turns around. He walks back, regarding the soldiers arrayed before the chapel.

Planting his cane in the soil, Ezra doffs his hat and the bandages covering his face. He shoves these things in the pockets of his jacket and advances on the Forsaken, whispering a spell. "Fellow Forsaken!" he bellows, his voice enhanced by the magic. "Citizenss of the Undercity! You all know what has happened to the Scarlet Monastery and its inhabitants. You know what Varimathras and his ally were plotting. You come here today to put a stop to whatever else may be lurking in the Scarlet Bastion." As he speaks, he raises his hands; a strong wind has sprung up around them, and particles of sand begin to stream from his fingers.

His body alters, dissolving into sand. He steps out of it a living man, clad in a black coat and well-worn garb, but a living man nonetheless. "Fellow enemies of the Scourge!" he calls now to the Argent Dawn's men. "You and the Scarlet Crusade have a history. Some of you must have called each other friend at one time. Perhaps you still do. But that which leads the Crusade now cannot be trusted - whether or not it is an enemy of the Scourge, it is no friend of yours. Some of you may know me. More will after this day is through." The sand shifts again. But this time he holds no definite form for long - one moment man, the next undead.

"Denizens of Lordaeron! You stand together for one common cause. Peace. The right for yourselves and your kin to live here, to have a place of your own. One enemy now threatens that peace." Ezra stares out with glowing eyes one moment, a clear and piercing gaze the next. "Lordaeron will be ours. _All of us_." The sandstorm engulfs him a final time, and the burned cadaver emerges again.

Nerai looks around, between the two groups of solders, and begins clapping. A smile on her face, and no comment, but she does rasp her claws together, looking at the other groups.

Saeren does not clap, but waits to see the reaction of the soldiers here, her eyes focused and ready.

Another pair of hands from the Argent Dawn force joins Nerai's... and then another, from the Forsaken side... and soon the applause spreads through the entire army.

"Death to the enemies! The traitors will fall!" She looks aside to Ezra, allowing a small smile to curve her lips. Hunger for battle can pry out a few words from her.

Ezra regains his hat and cane, and hobbles past Daniel Bates. "Thank you for coming," he whispers as he goes. And tipping his hat politely, he steps off to the side.

During the speech, Maxwell Tyrosus has a charger to stand before his men, and watched, quietly speaking with his opposite number amongst the Forsaken. Now, as the combined forces of the dead and the living cheer together, he mounts his horse and raises his sword. "Let us go, then, and make Saidan Dathrohan answer for his crimes!"

---

The undead at Stratholme's gates melted away even before Ezra's small force. Against the army marching through the gates now, they fall like grain before the scythe. In no time, they reach the barricades of the Scarlet Bastion.

Tyrosus rides in front and calls to the Crusaders manning the barricades. "Brothers in the Light! We come to arrest Saidan Dathrohan! Will you allow us passage?" A fusillade of crossbow bolts and fireballs is his only answer. "Very well, then. Charge!" he calls. The barricades offer only brief protection - especially when a certain night elf sniper picks them off from nearby rooftops. Though even she finds herself outmatched by the skill of Nathanos Blightcaller, leader of the Forsaken force and legendary dark ranger.

Nerai and Vickers are part of the initial push into the compound. Nerai and Vickers round one corner, a customary volley of arrows and fireballs bounces impotently off of the armor and the golem. Nerai turns to Vickers, "Now." And the hot lead death delivery system springs to life, the barrels turning, spewing round after violent round of gunfire down range, some hitting the walls, and one bouncing out of a window, the pane broken out, but what's mostly left is the scarlet blood of the Scarlet Crusade, giving it's all to stain the floors of their compound. Nerai looks at Vickers, "Next."

Ezra makes himself useful. Although reluctant to use his normal form of combat magic, he has something else. Wearing the enchanted leather armor he recently purchased, he'll make an appearance around a corner to bait archers or gunmen. Those who open fire find him a hard target, as he magically blinks back behind cover. And while the attackers are reloading their weapons, the Argent Dawn or the Undercity's forces may take advantage of the delay.

Saeren is no stranger to these halls, or killing these men. She is a ghost, and she does not fight behind the lines, but moves ahead. For the men following in her wake, the battle is one of eerie silence punctuated by moments of horrible violence. Bodies are found with the cruel wounds of her Sai or with eyes ripped out after the night elf retrieves her arrows. While she is no match for Blightcaller, she outmatches these adversaries.

The Crusaders had made a few preparations for attack - some of the makeshift barricades in the inner chambers are rather better built than they should have been - but against the sheer numbers they face, it is to no avail - especially given the night elf and forsaken assassins who slip beyond those barricades. Nevertheless, they fight to the death, and more than a few manage to commit suicide before being captured.

Eventually, the vanguard of the army arrives at a locked door, unlabeled - but according to Nathanos, definitely the quarters of the Grand Inquisitor. "It is magically locked," reports the Blightcaller, as Tyrosus arrives. "Then we shall breach it by force," replies the latter.

The oaken door proves tougher than it would appear, but eventually bursts inward on its hinges. And inside, the burly, copper-bearded man known as Saidan Dathrohan - standing inside an arcane circle chalked on the floor. "A rather rude entrance, don't you think, Maxwell Tyrosus?"

"Varimathras is dead," croaks Ezra. "The living and the dead are arrayed againsst you as allies, yess. We're here only to detain you. We've already defeated you."

Dathrohan throws back his head in laughter. "Defeated me? You poor little mage! This is merely a setback. I will return stronger than ever..." As he speaks, his voice deepens and his skin darkens; great batlike wings erupt from his back; he grows to twice his height; and coiled horns spiral into place upon his head. "And there is nothing you and your pathetic little bands of ragtag paladins or unruly zombies can do to stop me."

Saeren doesn't even give Dathrohan the opportunity to finish his boasting. Two arrows are already ripping through the air, only to bounce uselessly off an invisible shield. Her stubborness insists that she immediately draw again.

Saeren's assault is the trigger. Tyrosus calls, "Attack!" and 'Dathrohan's' wards are soon buckling under an assault of wood, lead, and magic. From within, the transformed dreadlord laughs. "I'll admit that you've caused me some trouble, pesky mortals. Enjoy this momentary victory while it lasts. Your doom will come soon enough." He speaks a few brief syllables in Eredun, and a black, shimmering rift in space emerges behind him. He bows sardonically and backs through the portal, which shuts behind him - and a moment later, the magic circle erupts with a wave of arcane energy that crumples the defensive wards of the allied force and knocks them to the ground.

Saeren jumps to her feet with a growl. She looks around quickly, calling out, "Do you think he had time to leave any surprises in here?" She can hide her seething over the escape. There will be time to be verbose later.

In reply, Tyrosus barks orders. "Mages, report! Are there any further arcane booby-traps? Can you trace where he went?"

"He took with him everything he intended to," concludes Ezra after some intensive spellcasting. "My sstudy of gate magic iss .. more limited."

Ezra thinks carefully. "He musst have returned to a homeworld of the Burning Legion," he announces after a moment. "He did not ssimply teleport away, no." He looks up at Tyrosus. "Hiss next attempt will come when he hass marshalled enough forcess or gathered enough influence, yess. He will not be unprepared."

Tyrosus rubs his chin. "Following him would be dangerous then, even if we can manage it." He sighs. "Still, this explains how a good man could fall so far from the Light. That demon must've taken him years ago."

"Search the Bastion," Tyrosus orders. "Mages accompany, in case of dangers. We'll meet in the Bastion's Great Hall in one hour."

---

Most of "Dathrohan's" private notes were destroyed before the army arrived, but a few tidbits were left behind. The demon who slew the former Dathrohan and assumed his identity was the dreadlord Balnazzar, who Varimathras 'slew' at Sylvanas' behest after she had defeated them in battle. Evidently, either Varimathras faked Balnazzar's death, or death is not so meaningful to their kind as appearances might suggest.

Other reports from the Scarlet Bastion's intelligence section contain further news. Apparently, someone called Admiral Barean Westwind, thought lost in an ill-fated invasion of Northrend years ago, is on his way to New Avalon, on the coast of the Plaguelands, with a small army of Crusaders by his side. Westwind's return was precipitated by an urgent letter from Dathrohan, dated a mere day after Varimathras' defeat in the Undercity.

Ezra has taken a seat. He's asked Elaine and Andrew to join him, along with Daniel Bates, and Arcanist Doan - the only notable figure from the Scarlet Monastery's leadership who's present. And as the Argent Dawn and Forsaken forces fan out, he just laughs. "An actual demon led the Crusade. An _actual demon_. You know... we jusst joked about it." He looks from face to face.

The Crusaders' faces are grim and tight-lipped - except for Archivist Galford of the Bastion, who was captured in the battle and remains shackled. "This is some kind of trick!" he cries. "A deception, meant to weaken our resolve!"

"Imbecile," hisses Saeren. "Even when the light burns your eyes with the truth you are blind to it."

"Fine," rejoins Ezra dryly. "Then where is your Grand Crusader at the moment? Where did he go off to at ssuch an important moment, so that we could create thiss demonic illusion?"

"He must have escaped!" replies Galford, hesitantly at first. "Yes, escaped from you Scourge agents and your Argent Dawn dupes!"

This makes Ezra 'smile' even more. "Sso... what you are ssaying is that... the Grand Crusader of the Sscarlet Crusade - the indomitable leader of your forcess here - he... he _ran away_? Hohoho. My resolve would weaken too, if that happened."

"What merit is there in dying to the-" Galford begins, but is cut off by Doan. "Silence, you fool," says the mage. "I saw it with my own eyes. You have known me for years - will you call me a liar now?"

Ezra places both hands on the head of his cane and looks up from face to face. He finishes by directing his attention to Galford. "Archivist, eh? You should believe what you like. But there is something important for you to remember. Here, right now, your Grand Crussader is no more. He deceived you. He lied to you, yess. But.. in _your_ heart, there is still a flame of truth, a sacred fire which burns and cannot be denied. Your Scarlet power is broken, yes. But you, Galford, _you_. You have dedication to that which drove all these men and women here. To rid this land of the Scourge. To make a safe home for yourself. You are no front-line fighter, no. You catalog, correlate, study. In this way do you keep your friends and family safe."

"Your Sscarlet power is broken." The wizard sand-shifts, becoming human again. "Now is the time for you to strengthen your Galford power. Find that fire in your heart. No lie can extinguish it. No betrayal can snuff it out. Find your dedication, and find a new home for yourself. With the Argent Dawn, or on your own, with your colleagues. But don't give up hope that what you want can become reality."

He turns to his former wife. "You also. Your power as a Confessor of the Crusade is gone. But the Holy Light remains with you. And more - you have Elaine power. You kept many good men from damnation time and time again. I am one of them. _No one else_ could have done this. That's true power. Remember it, nurture it, and use it."

Galford glares at Ezra wordlessly; but Elaine bows. "If I've saved you, then you've saved me as well. Not just from death, but from unwitting servitude to an agent of the Burning Legion." She looks at Galford, with a sigh. "Galford, please do not be bitter. There is no shame in being deceived by a dreadlord. As _you_ well know, they are renowned for their cunning."

Ezra turns too to Andrew. "Young man, you have Andrew power. A knowledge of magic, which you're bad at. You still retain it. A knack for stealing things which don't belong to you, which turn out to have changed everything for all of us." He smiles too at Daniel Bates. "You, who by all rights should be.... well. You are here, and free. I've already told you the power you have and encouraged you to use it. I ask now something else." He gestures to Elaine. "You both are new people. Get to know each other as new people. Remind yourselves of what you had, but don't be bound by it."

Finally, with his companions nearby, Ezra addresses himself to Maxwell Tyrosus. "On Kalimdor, sir, are a people called the draenei. Newly arrived to this world. Physically they look like eredar. Spiritually they are as you - wielders and followers of the Holy Light. With them is a creature called a naaru, named O'ros. I suggest that you send an expedition to Kalimdor, have a few of your emissaries meet with this creature, and fit yourselves into his peoples' program of universal brotherhood. They are here to defeat the Legion in all its forms, and will be a great asset to you."

Ezra casts an eye at Saeren, Nerai and Kagarn. "I ah, I will be going that way anyway. I have business with the leadership of the Horde, concerning the Blood Elves. I fear a simple warning will not be sufficient to ah, dissuade them from dealings with the naga. For this I need the power of the Warchief." He smiles at Nerai in particular. "And so this is goodbye. You need to warn Ironforge. They will listen to you. And further south, the kingdom of Stormwind."

Saeren frowns at Ezra, but does not change her course, "Ironforge, than Stormwind. Surely if I am to take a tour of every great city it is a sign of the coming doom." She looks to Nerai, "Still, we bring hope as well, don't we, my friend?"

Nerai raises an eyebrow, "You're leaving? You're leving me in charge?" She panics just a little bit, looking back at Saeren, and then back at Ezra, "You can't leave!"

"I can. I must." Ezra smiles. "You have capable skills at invention and are a good fighter. But you have something else. You have Nerai power. You can do things that no other goblin can do. Use that power." He withdraws something from his pocket and presents it for inspection. It looks like a compass, but isn't pointing north. "A simple seeker-compass, which homes in on the _Defiant_. When my business is done on Kalimdor, I'll find you again."

Nerai looks up at Saeren, then back at Ezra. She smiles back at him, then nods at him, "We will see you again." She looks at him, "We will.." She smiles at Saeren, "We bring something. I'm just not sure that it's hope that we have brought... but it does seem to follow not far behind." She nods to Ezra.

"We are what we are," says Saeren softly. "We will do well."

Kagarn bows to Ezra. "You are one of the most extraordinary beings I have met in my travels, Ezra Pyreborn. We _will_ meet again, and I look forward to our next meeting - and to learning what you will have accomplished in my absence. Until then, may the eternal sun shine upon you."

Ezra smiles. "Be verbose. Be reckless. Be my friend Kagarn, who I will remember and return to," he answers softly. And then he looks around again. "Although I am in no position to give orders, I recommend a general amnesty for members of the Scarlet Crusade who are willing to fight with the Argent Dawn. Many of you hate me and my kind. I accept that. You have your reasons. But don't lose yourself to the despair that the dreadlord wished for you. Free your home from the real enemy. And be great."

"The Scarlet Crusade has always been welcome to return to the fold," Tyrosus says. "We will welcome them with open arms. And once again the Argent Dawn thanks you, Ezra Pyreborn, for all you have done for us - and for all of Lordaeron."

Ezra tips his hat politely. And taking his cane, he begins hobbling for the entrance to the bastion. There's business to attend to.

Saeren slips away, using her talent for hiding in a sliver of shadow. When Ezra exits the Bastion, she is waiting. "You gave me hope, Ezra Pyreborn. You gave me purpose. You gave me myself." For a moment, the shadowy night elf looks nervous. "Take care of yourself, please. The family I once knew is gone, the new one I have found with your aid is just forming. I count you as part of it."

In response, Ezra reaches into his pocket. He pulls out the carefully flattened and preserved remnants of a flower - the same one, it looks like, that he briefly examined in Moonglade - and presents it reverently. "A memory of smiles and flowers sustained me, until I met my living family again," he says. "I will return for this memento. Take care of it."

Saeren takes the flower with great care and smiles, "Until the next time we meet, Ezra Pyreborn. Oh, and if you have the time to visit my new family, please send them my love."

Ezra nods. He hesitates a moment, not turning away. "You ah, you should change your name, by the way," he suggests. "You are Finblighter no longer. You have become more. Share your true heart with those around you." And he tips his hat. "Good-bye."

Saeren nods to Ezra, smiling. "I will find it by the time we meet next. Farewell! And thank you."
