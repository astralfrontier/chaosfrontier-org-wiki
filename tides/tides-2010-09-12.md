The Defiant takes to the air and soars over the southern mountains, leaving the Plaguelands far behind. Ezra has gone his own way for the time being, but he has left behind a mission: warn the nations of humans, dwarves, and gnomes of the rising Tide of naga, murlocs, and their dark patron that seeks to swallow the lands of Azeroth.

Nerai sits at the helm of The Defiant with what remains of the crew. She looks from Saeren to Kagarn. "Well," She says, still unsure of herself at this point, "I think Ezra said we should go to Ironforge next..." She begins, "And I really would like to get back there..." She rubs her chin, "Anyone else have thoughts?"

Saeren stands at Nerai's side, staring ahead into an uncertain future. "I think Ironforge is as a good a start as any. I have misgivings about Stormwind, so gaining a bit of a reputation among the dwarves and gnomes strikes me as a fine idea."

Kagarn looks into the southern sky. "It seems like as good a destination as any. If you wish, though, I can ask advice of the spirits as well. When we arrive in Ironforge, it will be well to understand how we should proceed." His broad face creases in an ironic smile. "After all, we count a tauren and a goblin among our number - neither are much loved in Ironforge. And the night elves, although welcome, are little known."

"I will take advice from any that will listen, at this point." Nerai smiles at this last from Kagarn, "I'm not expecting it to be easy, per se.." She thinks, "I have passage into Ironforge." She pauses, "Or, at least, I used too.." She looks at a wrench she hold in her claw.

Kagarn bows. "Then I shall take my leave. If an emergency arises, you will find me in my quarters." As the last wisps of plaguemist recede into the distance, he adds, "Though unless matters have gotten far worse in Lordaeron, I doubt any such emergency will arise."

"I'm sure we'll get the kind of greeting we're used to," says Saeren. "We've hardly had parades of celebration thrown in our honor anywhere we've gone."

Nerai darkly acknowledges this last. Their cold reception at every party is something of a sore spot for the goblin, even now. She sighs, turning to the control surfaces of The Defiant. Sweet familiarity to calm a goblin's nerves. Her claws clack across the surfaces, guiding the ship into the air, and directing it to Ironforge.

The forest on the far side of the mountains, in contrast to the Plaguelands, is rich and vibrant; the curse of the Lich King did not spread this far south. They are not alone in the sky, in these lands; this is the home of the Wildhammer dwarves, famous for taming and riding the mighty gryphons native to this land, and for their deadly stormhammers.

A far-ranging aptrol of the Wildhammers approaches, drawing alongside; their leader waves a signal flag to request a parley. After Nerai signals in the affirmative, he comes aboard on the upper deck, his companions remaining aloft and wary. "Be ye the Defiant?" he asks.

Nerai can't help but sigh as she hears this, "Indeed. Word of us has been far reaching, I take it?" Almost worried to hear the answer.

The dwarf grunts. "Eh, don't worry, they say good things aboot ye. We has us a visitor from the east. Big guy with blue skin and bony forehead, calls himself a 'draenei'. He's told us a buncha crazy stuff, but looks like at least he was right about you guys." He looks past Nerai and Saeren. "So where's yer cow-man? An' yer zombie?"

Nerai stares daggers at the dwarf. She shakes her head, this should have been expected. "Kagarn is currently consulting the spirits for guidance." She says, somewhat loftily, "Ezra was detained in the Plaguelands looking after some business about his family, and will not be joining us presently." She says, as diplomatically as possible.

The dwarf rubs his beard. "Good enough. All right, listen up, you two. We ain't sure yet if we're buyin' what Mister Rualeth is sellin', and that goes for you folks as well. We ain't been attacked by no naga or murlocs oursel's, an' if we do, we'll be sure ta send word if we need it. In the meanwhile, we'd be obliged if ye'd give Aerie Peak a wide berth an' go on yer way. Sound good?"

Nerai looks quizzically at the dwarf, "Is there... a reason we need to avoid the Peak?" She asks, pointedly, "Our flight plan was taking us to Ironforge first anyway, but I hardly see why we shouldn't..." She basically trails off at this point.

"'Cos we don't want ye here, that's why!" snaps the dwarf. "Nothin' personal, ye understand - we Wildhammers just like ta keep to oursel's."

"Doesn't everybody?" Nerai mumbles to herself, and waves a hand, speaking louder and clearer "We're not making our way there now. And we will be sure to inform you if we see a need to make our way there later." That's about as good as she's willing to give for right now.

"What earns trust in the minds of the Wildhammers, master dwarf?" asks Saeren. "We're rather accustomed to having to start out from scratch every time we meet someone new."

The dwarf gives Saeren a long look. "We ain't really a trustin' sort, ye ken. We don't really need ta be. But ye don't seem like bad sorts. If we _did_ get in trouble an' need help, we wouldn't say no ta ye."

"Then I wish for you the ability to ask when the need arises." Nerai says, in what she hopes is a diplomatic fashion. "It was nice meeting you, sir." And she bows, in a dwarfly fashion.

"When that time comes, and it likely will be either of it wants to, we will answer the call," says Saeren. She looks to Nerai and nods, "It's time for us to be moving on, then."

The dwarf snorts, but not unkindly, as he remounts his gryphon. "Safe travels," he says, and his patrol recedes into the distance - though Saeren's eyes can still pick it out, keeping pace with the Defiant until it leaves Wildhammer airspace.

---

The sun is setting before Kagarn returns to the flight deck. The scent of incense floats around him. "We must plot a new course. Travel due east." He raises his hand and releases a small amount of fine powder, which is caught by an errant breeze; Kagarn points in that direction. "That way."

One doesn't ask for spiritual guidance, and then scoff when they give you a large bullish GPS. She nods, and makes the change of course in the Defiant's heading.

Kagarn's destination is nearly a day's travel to the east. The sun is low in the sky, almost occluded by the glimmering purple dome surrounding the former site of the magocracy of Dalaran, when Kagarn directs the Defiant to fly lower to the ground, just south of the jutting cliffs at the base of the Alterac Mountains.

"You know, I'm not an expert of the geography of this land, but.. this doesn't appear to be an alliance capital," notes Saeren. She looks to Kagarn, waiting for an explanation.

Nerai shrugs, "I'm slightly more worried flying this low without a landing pad around. I don't care when we make it to Ironforge, just that we do.. without having to lift it out of a swamp or something."

"No, it is not," Kagarn confirms, nodding to Saeren. "It is the dwelling place of a child of the elements. She needs our help, and we need hers. Land here, Nerai. Her abode is not far." The shaman indicates a clearing, spacious enough to pose no hazard to the Defiant's envelope... but also distant from _any_ of the nearby settlements. This is a wild land of evergreen trees and animal life, unsuitable for farming, and the only humanoids known to live near here are the yeti in the nearby caves.

Nerai smiles, "Oh. Good." She says, and sets the Defiant down on the ground, prepping the landing ramp, and generally doing the landing activities.

Disembarking, Kagarn casts another pinch of dust into the air. This time, the dust swirls uncertainly for a while, before drifting vaguely to the north. "This way," he says, setting out.

"A child of the elements?" asks Saeren. She looks to Shade, the cat surprising her with a sudden rub of its shoulder against her. "Of course you will come," she says reassuringly. "I just hope this child is a tame one."

Kagarn turns to the others. "I fear that which we seek may not be so tame as all that. You had best bring your fighting machine, Nerai. Not only for the child; there are yeti in these parts." He smiles at Nerai. "I _know_ that Eecee is efficacious against those."

Nerai nods to Saeren, unfolding Eecee front eh airship and getting him gassed and powered up. She starts the machine, and follows along, "I'm not sure anything can be tame out here...."

As the party heads north into the woods, they are observed by many eyes. Most are local wildlife, which flee the noisy steam armor; others are yeti, which are easy to spot; they carefully assess the party from a distance, and _then_ flee.

But after a while, Saeren becomes aware that there is something else out there. Too small and nimble to be a yeti, and too clever to be an animal. The night elf sentinel catches only the briefest glimpses of a humanoid shape.

Saeren looks over to Kagarn, "There is something out there." She continues on, asking, "Should I find out what it is? It's not an animal."

Nerai nods, and stops Eecee, which doesn't stop the noise, but does stay it a bit. "Sure. But don't kill it."

Saeren nods to Nerai and whispers something to Shade. The animal continues on with the group, while the night elf steps away, almost melting into the air as she seeks to learn more about their strange observer.

As Saeren approaches the position at which she last saw the shadowy figure, she sees little more. And as she reaches that position, she finds tracks - _human_ tracks - that suddenly vanish without a trace.

Saeren studies the area, but does not wait long before returning to the others. Perhaps Kagarn's spirits can make sense of this.

Kagarn listens to Saeren's report, and tosses another handful of dust into the air. This time, the breeze swirls it around, then lifts it _upward_.

...and after a few moments, a strong breeze blows the powder to the northeast. Whatever they are hunting, it's on the move.

"If it needs our help, why does it flee?" asks Saeren. "Does it see as a threat?"

The hunt continues. Saeren does not make any more sightings, but Kagarn's divination continues to provide useful guidance... up to a point. "The child of the elements must be using its power," comments Kagarn. "If it stops doing so, the elements will be less able to track it." And sure enough, the next cast shows uncertain results again. "The elements tell me that their child needs our help. They do not say whether their child knows this."

Eventually, in a wooded grove, Kagarn says, "My divination can produce no better results. The child is not far. We must search from here."

"Then it's time for Shade to put his nose to use." Saeren commands the cat in Darnassian. "If the child leaves no footprints, hopefully it will have a scent to track."

Shade puts its nose to the ground, ranging in an increasingly widening circle. Saeren knows her friend's body language, and it's clear that the cat can find no traces...

"It appears we're out of luck," says Saeren. She looks thoughtful and then suggests, "Kagarn, why not call out? Perhaps your voice is what this child will respond to."

Kagarn nods to Saeren. "Child of the elements!" he calls out, in a booming voice. "Please do not flee. We mean you no harm. We wish to help you, and we seek your help!"

From beyond the trees, a voice comes back. But it isn't speaking common. "Draek tchor'ah taegoson gi'azol'em Earthen Ring zoern kilagrin kan drinor kilagrin!"

"Well, that's something," says Saeren. "So, what did she say?" Of course Kagarn knows. He has to.

Kagarn waves Saeren into silence. "Z'daar erna Earthen Ring graak. Kilagrin da var'zuul kilagrin?" He kneels down and plants an ornately carved totem in the ground, and everyone nearby feels the vigor of the elements coursing through them.

From a hiding place behind the treeline, a figure emerges - the same one Saeren saw earlier. It's filthy, and furry, like a young yeti, but with the proportions of an adult human. Even a yeti child wouldn't be this small. It creeps forward warily, a sharp rock clenched in one hand, blue eyes looking out from a face plastered in mud.

Kagarn raises his hands in the air. "No threatening moves, my friends," he says. Let her get used to us." He addresses the apparition. "D'zzar kaimon vreeth?"

The creature thinks a moment, then bobs its - her - head. "Your name?" she asks hesitantly.

Nerai turns, herself, not Eecee, that is, and smiles at the creature.

"I am Kagarn Stormhoof," replies the tauren. "These are my companions, Saeren and Nerai."

Saeren squats down so as to appear less threatening, watching the figure curiously. At her side, Shade watches, the cat surveying this new stranger and sniffing the air curiously.

The furred thing gets closer. It isn't real fur, after all - it's a person, wearing furs. She bares her arms, revealing two bracers of a twisty black metal affixed to them, and kneels. "Roc'grare fel'tes fraht telsrah quin'mahk tadrom zela'von desh'noka tae'gel'kir, goshi."

Kagarn is taken aback for a moment, then nods, stepping forward cautiously and touches his hands to the bracers. "Roc'grare zi'tah da, naar v'diss ulamon." And then in Common: "What is your name?"

The girl in the furs keeps her head down. "Named Sookie, goshi. Commanded to serve a shaman of the Earthen Ring."

Kagarn tilts his head. "Commanded by who?"

Sookie pauses. "Last order from my keeper. She died. Said, flee this place and find a shaman of the Earthen Ring, pledge yourself to him."

Saeren looks over to Nerai, arching an eyebrow. Whatever question she has, the night elf does not feel it wise to give it voice just yet.

Kagarn nods. "We will speak of this later. It may be important to our quest, but I must know more to even ask the right questions. In the meantime, the present is more important. How far do you travel in these parts?"

Sookie thinks a moment. She points west, over her shoulder. "Hillsbrad. Human village. _Alliance_ village." This last has some spite to it. "Raid for food. Cave to the west. Some yeti furs. Seen men moving in the uplands too."

Kagarn nods, rubbing his chin. "You seem unhappy with the Alliance. Why is that?"

Sookie looks frankly baffled behind her mask of mud. "They're enemy, goshi," she says, puzzled.

"Whose enemy?" asks Kagarn. "Do they bear some particular grudge against you, or against your former keepers?"

Nerai looks at Sookie. "This sounds like it could be trouble..." She mutters, more or less to herself.

Sookie nods. "They're enemy of the Horde. Aren't you.. with the Horde?" she asks carefully.

"I am," Kagarn says. "And my companions are no enemies of the Horde." He rubs his chin. "How long have you lived here? How many winters since your keeper died?"

"Perhaps, but with as much trouble as we have, what's a little more challenge?" asks Saeren of Nerai. "Besides, it's clear we're needed here. She must have been waiting a long time an the Earthen Circle to appear."

Sookie casts a wary eye at Saeren. "Three winters, goshi."

"You are a strong survivor," replies Saeren.

Nerai shrugs at Saeren. She begins to speak, thinging better of it. She turns to Sookie, "It would be somewhat more correct to say that we don't take sides in the war." She pauses, "We are, in fact, on a quest somewhat more important than the traditionall strugle."

Sookie thinks a moment. "Have to get to Stormwind," she mutters. "Goshi, what now? I follow you."

Kagarn regards Sookie skeptically. "If the Alliance is your enemy, what business have you in Stormwind?" he asks.

"What I was made for," the girl answers. "Supposed to go there 'n have them befriend me."

Nerai looks at Sookie, "Well... I think we will find that helpful." Man, how did Ezra do this diplomacy thing?

"That may be a challenge," Kagarn says, eyeing Sookie warily. "Before they can befriend you, you will have to act the way that humans act in Stormwind. My friends and I can teach you something of this, but we have business of our own. Come with us, please, Sookie."

Sookie gets up from kneeling. A thought hits her. "Goshi, have to get Important Things from cave. May I get them?"

Kagarn nods. "Shall we wait here, or do you know where our flying machine landed?" he asks.

Sookie shakes her head. "Wait here. Back soon." And a sudden gust of air surrounds her, whisking her off into the sky.

Nerai looks at Kagarn, "So... an old friend?" She smirks.

Kagarn shakes his head. "The elements spoke of her as their child. And yet she appears human. This... worries me."

Nerai looks at Kagarn, "Elaborate? Why would this confuse you?"

"I have dealt with many spirits of the elements," Kagarn says. "They do not mate with humans, nor do they bear children with them. And it is beyond the power of elementals to appear as human."

"So she's the first," says Saeren. "What's so horrible about that? Other than trying to figure out the mechanics of such a thing, of course." She can't imagine.

Nerai shakes her head, "Perhaps the spirits are being.. somewhat metaphorical? I mean, she seems to be at a base or elemental state right now..."

"Saeren, the 'mechanics', as you say, are precisely what worries me," Kagarn says. "You heard her - she was 'made'. And she was made for the purposes of traveling to Stormwind and being befriended - by those who taught her that the Alliance was the enemy." To Nerai: "The words in Kalimag for 'follower' or 'disciple' are different from those for 'offspring'. The elemental spirits do have offspring of their own - but only among their own kind. Normally."

"So you fear that this child is a danger, though she may not even know it," says Saeren. "Some parents... to use her as a weapon. Still, such horror stories are far from unheard of."

Kagarn nods. "This is a mystery we must unravel. But the elements regard her as one of their own, and whatever design she may have originally been intended for, she is pledged to me now, and I am responsible for her."

"Have you ever had a child in your care, Kagarn?" asks Saeren.

"The tauren way is that the young are cared for by all," Kagarn says. "But we shamans tend to be set somewhat apart from child-rearing. If I had to answer your question in a single word, then, it would be 'no'."

"I will help you with what little skill I have," Saeren says. "Though it has been a long time since I have tended a character."

"It will be appreciated," Kagarn says.

Nerai thinks to herself, "Honestly, She doesn't seem to need a nanny. Refinement might be hard to come by, but I think she can hold her own pretty well."

"She is a survivor, but I think when it comes to social abilities, those who looked after her were not very focused. Which actually worries me, considering what you've said, Kagarn." Saeren looks to Shade and grins, "And yes, you can help too. You are, after all, the most house-broken of all of us."

Time passes, and the girl comes back. Perhaps - it's hard to tell if it's the same girl. She's still wearing yeti furs, only fewer of them - her arms and legs are now bare. More importantly, she's washed away the mud from her face and hair. They must have been an attempt at camouflage. Underneath the mud pack, she's remarkably attractive as humans go, though the everpresent wariness of her body language remains. She carries three things: a Sharp Rock, a Torn Book Page, and a Red Cloth Scrap.

She holds up the page for Kagarn's inspection. On it is a woman in a fancy dress, apparently attending a ball or dance party of some kind. She stands proudly, regarding several people illustrated in the background. "Supposed to do this," she explains.

"Well, I'd have to say we'll probably have to find some humans to teach you some of this," says Kagarn. "Though I venture to guess you have considerable potential. And now, let us be off."

As the party heads back to the airship with its newest member, Kagarn asks Sookie one more thing. "Have there been disruptions in the element of water in these parts? Signs of water becoming out of control, exceeding its ordained boundaries?"

Sookie walks slack-jawed for a second, staring at the sky. "Ah. Uh. Meddling humans bind the earth up in northwest. Something going on south, too, don't know what. 'Fraid to go down there. I tell you if I feel such things."

"That will suffice," Kagarn says warmly.

So the crew becomes just that much more motley as Nerai prepares the airship to take off. Quarters are found for Sookie, so she can stow and protect Important Things, and Saeren is called upon to watch as she can.

Night falls on The Defiant as it flies off in the direction of Ironforge.
