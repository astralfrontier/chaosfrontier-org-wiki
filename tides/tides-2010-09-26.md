After interviewing Sookie in greater detail, Kagarn calls for a meeting with Nerai and Saeren. Sookie herself is instructed to keep watch on deck while the Defiant idles over the skies of Hillsbrad.

Carefully closing the door of the map room behind him, Kagarn addresses his companions. "I have spoken with our newest ally at some length," he begins. "The first thing you need to know is that she is a creation of the Twilight's Hammer."

"The second thing you need to know is that she does not partake in their evil," continues the shaman. "She is innocent - in a certain sense. She simply does not know evil from good, in the way that most civilized people do. The Twilight's Hammer _do_ know, and _choose_ evil."

"Do they control her in some way?" asks Saeren. "Or is she free to learn and make that choice on her own?"

Nerai looks, "I would think, just in the short time we've talked, that she doesn't know good from evil in the same sense that a wolf may not know such things." She mutters under her breath, "Or a gold-crazed Goblin."

"They do not control her - I do," replies Kagarn. "Her handler's dying command was for her to flee the Hammer and bind herself to a member of the Earthen Ring."

Nerai looks at Kagarn, "Bind herself?"

"She is a hybrid of elemental and human," says Kagarn. "The result of the sort of twisted experiment that the Twilight's Hammer delights in. And as part elemental, she is subject to being bound by those who have the knowledge of binding elementals. You recall the metal bracers she wore? They are of the same sort worn by bound elementals."

"So why would her handler order her to bind to the Earthen Ring?" asks Saeren.

"I do not know, because Sookie did not know," says Kagarn. "But I _speculate_ that her handler must once have been a shaman, back on Draenor when the orcs still practiced shamanism. And when that orc woman learned that orcs had regained their connection with the spirits of the elements, she did what she could to honor that connection."

"So her handler was.. a reformed Twilight's Hammer?" Saeren sounds more than a little suspicious.

"Life is deadly dangerous for a Twilight's Hammer who has second thoughts about her allegiance," replies Kagarn. "But that woman's actions speak for themselves. The Hammer would never have voluntarily relinquished such a being as Sookie - and Sookie _cannot_ lie to me."

"I'm given to trust Sookie, anyway." Nerai says, "There's not a lot of room for malice in her it seems. If she meant us ill, she would probably have harmed us already."

Saeren nods to Nerai, "I don't doubt that. Of course, we may not be the target. We're just a very convenient group to run into. Seems like a lot of coincidence at play here. We must be cautious."

Nerai smiles, "I wouldn't have minded a feral half elemental being unleashed as a nuisance on some of our former 'allies'" This last spoken like you might the word 'scum'.

Kagarn nods in agreement. "She is violent, but she is not cruel or manipulative. When you spoke of her as being akin to a wolf, Nerai, you were not far from the mark." He regards Saeren. "As for coincidence - it _was_ no coincidence that brought us here. I was _sent_ here by the elements, who recognized one of their own and saw the need for a shaman to look after her."

Saeren nods to Kagarn, "And many knew you would be with us, my friend, and your connection to the elements is not hard to guess. Watch her carefully, for her sake as much as others."

The Defiant reaches the coastline. The human settlement of Southshore is far to the east; the coastline itself is completely absent of habitation. However, it is not absent of _signs_ of habitation - a few murloc huts can be seen far below. All vacant.

"That doesn't seem right," mutters Saeren. She points down to the shoddy huts below, "The Murlocs are missing. Whatever is going on, I doubt it's a good thing."

Nerai nods, "With Murlocs, is it ever a good thing?"

"Tracks going to the east," says Saeren grimly. "I suggest we follow quickly."

Nerai nods to Saeren, and turns The Defiant in the direction of the tracks.

As the airship flies eastward, it becomes clear that the entire coastline has been emptied of its murloc population. Their destination becomes clear, as the sounds of battle slowly begin to carry over the water - and the instant Southshore becomes visible around the side of a sea cliff, along with the throngs of murlocs and naga locked in battle with its human defenders.

Saeren draws arrows immediately, "Looks like we're here just in time for the work." She sets to work quickly calculating the balance of power, and at the same time select an ideal target.

Nerai looks down, and looks at Saeren and Kagarn. "That... doesn't look great now, does it. However, not that unfamiliar."

Things are not going well for the defenders of Southshore - but this is not entirely because of the aquatics themselves. As Saeren looks closer, she spots a number of shorter humanoids. Dwarves - fighting on the side of the naga.

"Dwarves, naga, and murlocs," mutters Saeren. "Kagarn! What do you suggest about these dwarves?" After all, Saeren only has so many arrows.

Kagarn looks over the battlefield, and grimaces. "I have no suggestions," he says. "We can only hope to capture them alive, that they may be purified."

Saeren calls out to Nerai, "Within 200 yards, if you would. I'm about to to send their commander a couple of messages." She adds softly, "Kagarn, if Sookie could join us, I think now is a good time to find out just what kind of things she does in a fight."

Kagarn nods, and heads belowdecks in search of his charge.

Nerai takes the helm, and navigate sthe ship to the position indicated, hovering around the intended target.

Kagarn turns a corner, finding Sookie curled up on the floor, hand clenched around her Sharp Rock, eyes red and puffy. She looks up in a panic, and wields the rock in a trembling hand. She rises, rock still at the ready. "They're near," she whispers.

The elven sentinel takes careful aim, and fires. She is certain in her heart that her aim is true - and yet, at the last moment, the arrows miss by the merest fraction of an inch. The four-armed naga woman who commands the attack looks up sharply, directly at the Defiant. Her eyes narrow - and she calls out to her forces. It is still too far to hear her exact words, but the combined aquatic and dwarven forces begin to _withdraw_, to the east. As they retreat, Saeren can see the naga making an obscene gesture in her direction.

"Hmph," grumbles Saeren. Even as her bow sings, raining death on retreating murlocs, she speaks. "I guess we might as well land and see what has happened. Is there a spot for us to do so, Nerai? Depending on the state of things, we may have to help them evacuate the injured. Unless you wish to hunt that army of murlocs, of course." She falls silent, letting her bow talk for a while.

Belowdecks, Kagarn asks, "Who is near, Sookie?" His voice is full of concern for whatever has alarmed the half-elemental under his care.

"The... the water disturbance you asked about." Sookie rubs her eyes. "Where am I?"

"You're aboard the Defiant," replies Kagarn. "We were about to intervene in a naga attack on a village."

"Oh, okay." The girl seems to calm down. "Village resistance is tough? Leave it to me, goshi."

Kagarn raises a hand. "Hold. Why do you assume that we intervene on the naga's behalf?" He glances to the stairs, grateful that Saeren cannot hear this conversation.

Sookie blinks. Her grip on the rock tightens. She pulls herself carefully to her feet, still keeping the stone ready as a weapon. "'Cause. That's what we do."

"Who is this 'we'?" asks Kagarn. "The Twilight's Hammer, who your handler sent you away from?"

That stops Sookie for a moment. She was relaxed a moment ago; now fear seems to be taking hold again. "I will do as I'm ordered to, goshi," she states flatly. "Give me orders."

Kagarn beckons. "Come and observe," he says. "Observe the naga. I am certain that it is they who disturb the elements - but see for yourself."

Sookie hunkers down for a moment and delicately nestles her Sharp Stone into the corner where she'd hid. She rises and moves, walking purposefully to do as she was commanded.

As Kagarn and Sookie arrive abovedecks, they are just in time to see the aquatic army in full flight. Bodies litter the field, of all species involved - even Saeren's crack archery have only managed to add a handful of fishmen to their number before they have retreated out of range. The defenders of Southshore are still on the barricades; bows are aimed at the airship, but not fired.

Kagarn shades his eyes. "What happened? Why do they retreat? Surely they do not flee a single airship?"

"They must have judged that we are just enough to tip the balance of battle," says Saeren. "The commander made a rather crude gesture at me after I tried to put her eyes out. For all the good it did! Something blocked my arrows."

Nerai looks, "Or, they're attacking to draw us out.... and it worked." Nerai shrugs. "Maybe the push did it's job, now that we're here?"

Sookie looks over the railing, studying the eastern retreat with narrowed eyes. She turns her attention to the Southshore defenders, watching for long moments. "Goshi, y'think they have anything to eat?" she asks quietly.

"If you were hungry, Sookie, you needed but ask," replies Kagarn. "But yes, I suspect that they will have something to eat." He nods to Nerai. "If it's all right with you?"

Sookie frowns a bit. "Well, naga retreated. Dumb humans got lucky. So we go ask 'em why they were attacked, right? So we should find food too."

Nerai nods, "Lucky we showed up to help, yes?" She nods at Sookie. "Why are you worried about food.. the larder is full... or was last time I checked."

Sookie peers down at Nerai. "Want venison," she mumbles unhappily.

Saeren looks at Sookie for a moment, ponders saying something, then realizes that in some corner of her mind she actually agrees. At least this time they won't have convince someone that the murlocs and naga are a true threat. Hearing Sookie's request, Saeren says, "They probably have some. If not, I could always hunt from the airship."

Nerai looks around, "Well, venison isn't going to leap onto the airship, so let's go see if we can help those nice people out, shall we?" She smiles, and wanders back to the control surfaces.

---

Southshore accepts its saviors warily, unwilling to trust the old adage 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend'. An the airship touches down by the half-wrecked dock, an emissary under flag of truce calls up. "Ho there, unknown airship! Who goes there?"

Nerai yells out of the ship, looking out one of the portholes before dropping the gang plank, "Southshore. We bring news of the Naga and their targets, along with help and possible remedies. We fight the Nada where they strike, and wish to ask about them, and help against them."

The emissary takes a step back, his shoulders slumped. "And how much will it cost us?"

Saeren steps onto the gang plank, the ghostly shape of her nightsaber at her side, "A good meal and a warmer welcome would go a long way. We enjoy extracting our payments from the treasures of the naga, but it seems, sadly, that they didn't wish to exercise such commerce with us just yet."

With a brief pause to let that sink in, Saeren adds, "And one of us would greatly appreciate venison, if you would be so kind."

Sookie stays behind Kagarn, warily looking about.

The human looks somewhat more relaxed. "Certainly," he says. "Who else is among you?"

Nerai clears her throat. No amount of practice seems to prepare Nerai for these sorts of confrontations, "In order to understand the Naga and their use of spirits, we also bring a Tauren as a companion, and his protege, a young girl." Nerai blurts this out, then draws her breath in slightly, "I an Nerai, This is Saeren." She gestures to the Night Elf, "And Kagarn and Sookie are still in the ship." Nerai looks anxious, and has more to ask, but is waiting for a sign.

The tauren emerges from the gangplank, his hands raised by his sides to demonstrate that he is unarmed. When the human defenders of Southshore fail to turn him into a pincushion, he gestures for Sookie to emerge as well.

Sookie slinks out carefully, using Kagarn as a living shield.

The emissary nods cordially to the new arrivals, and the defenders behind him lower their arms. "We bid you welcome to Southshore. Forgive the reception, but we are on a war footing." He glances to the east. "Why did they flee at the mere sight of you? Are you that deadly to them?"

Nerai doesn't really know what to say. "We have handed them many defeats, it is true. But the specific nature of this attack we cannot guess." Nerai blurts out the thing that is weighing on her mind, "How long have they been attacking along side dwarves?"

The emissary grimaces. "Come inside. We must speak of this at greater length." He nods to Kagarn and Sookie. "And we will see if venison can be served."

---

The meeting takes place in Southshore's town hall, with the town's magistrate introducing himself as Henry Maleb. There is indeed venison, served with potatoes and local vegetables.

Maleb does not wait for 'breakfast' to be complete, but launches right into business. "Nerai, you asked about the dwarves. The truth of the matter is that we don't know."

"The attack began at dawn. The only warning was an explosion on our eastern wall, followed by a wave of dwarves. At the same time, our docks were assaulted from the south by the sea-peoples."

Nerai nods to Maleb, "Yes." She looks around, "Is this the first time they've joined the Naga in an assult against you?" She looks noticably worried.. the Dwarves are her people.

"It is," replies Maleb. "At first, we thought they might have been the Dark Irons - but their complexion was of Ironforge. I recognized one or two of them; they are from Dun Garok, to the east. I did not understand, and still don't - we have had nothing but peaceful relations with them."

Nerai nods, "It follows a pattern we've seen before..." She looks at Saeren and nods, "After the meal, we should probably investigate the battlefield. There are.. physical ways to check."

Sookie has been greedily eating since before the group sat down. With her mouth full of a slab of meat and one hand reaching for the potatoes, she speaks up. "Waf yof meth?" She swallows. "What you mean?"

Saeren watches Sookie with an arched brow. Her way of eating is efficient, if nothing else. She shakes her head as she focuses on Maleb's tale. "I believe we can tell what is happening without checking, since you recognized some of them. Still, Nerai is right, we should look into things. We want to see if these dwarves have been cursed."

"My men are looking over the bodies now," Maleb says. "When you are done," he says, looking askance at Sookie, "you are welcome to join us." He sighs. "A new curse on our lands? We had thought ourselves lucky to have survived the first," he says, referring to the Scourge plague.

Nerai leans over to Sookie, "Sookie, you can slow down, I don't think they'll be taking it away." She turns back to Saeren. "It certainly fits the patterns, but it's best to be sure." She smiles at Maleb, "Hopefully we can cut this one off early." She says, weakly.

Saeren thinks for a moment, then says to Maleb. "Survive.. that is a good word. Maleb, this curse is an ancient one in a new form. Like all the most terrible curses, it is not a matter to be ended, but, as you say, survived."

Sookie cleans out her bowl, then gestures theatrically over it. Water begins pouring from her hands to fill it, and she raises the bowl to her lips and drinks greedily. "Spied on Dun Garok yet?" she asks.

"Not a bad idea," whispers Saeren.

Maleb straightens in his seat. He was not expecting this apparently uncultured savage to be a _mage_. "N-no, of course not. Not _yet_. We were only attacked this morning. We'll certainly reconnoiter _now_, of course."

Nerai's eyes turn to Maleb. "Please excuse our friend. She is not yet used to pleasant table conversation." She looks at Sookie, for what good it will do. She shakes her head, "Even if these nice people did have informants, I'm sure they wouldn't tell us." She smiles, and sighs.

"Let's go see what might be seen, then we will decide if I should go to Dun Garok as well," says Saeren.

---

The cause of the dwarves' betrayal is immediately clear to the adventurers, as the very first corpse to be inspected bears the now-familiar gills of the Tides' Curse. "How could this happen?" asks the human guardsman accompanying them, clearly horrified.

"This, my friends, is the curse we were speaking of," says Saeren. "Most unfortunate to find it again comes before we arrive. Did you take any of the enemy alive?"

"I'm afraid not," replies the guardsman. "It was a short battle, but brutal. We would have fallen swiftly if you had not arrived."

"Hm, they do fear us, don't they?" murmurs Saeren. She smiles grimly, "The time is coming swiftly where we teach them just how much they should. How far is Dun Garok?"

Nerai looks at Saeren, "We should mention other things to look for before we immediately depart."

"A day's march to the east," replies the guardsman. "But it's heavily fortified. And whatever the sea-people did to these dwarves did nothing to make them forget how to fight. We can't possibly break through their defenses. We might be able to besiege them, but the idea of starving a dwarf out of a mountain..." He chuckles bitterly.

Saeren nods to Nerai, "True. I don't actually expect us all to go. I'm just interested in confirming our fears. If the dwarves are all taken, things here are going to prove most difficult." She looks to Maleb, "Most importantly, how quickly can we get messages to your people and your allies? The naga have come out into the open. We cannot let them pick off the weak one by one."

Nerai smiles at Maleb, "With the curse, it's usually as easy as cutting off sources of sea water." She shakes her head, "I wonder how the Dwarfs got taken, however." She says, more or less to herself.

"We sent fast riders in all directions the moment we were attacked," replies Maleb. "If the Dalaran rider makes it, word will be out to Stormwind by sunset."

"Corrupted water source, most likely," says Saeren. "Nerai, what do you think we should do? Make straight to Stormwind? Scout the dwarves first? I'm prepared to assume that the worst has happened at Dun Garok. It's the most likely conclusion."

Sookie speaks up. "Dagun's ascendant acolytes always thirsty. Dwarves will come out of the mountain without sea water." She tugs at Kagarn's sleeve. "Goshi, issat what naga are doing with the elementals?"

"Almost certainly," Kagarn says. "That is what they did at Tides' Hollow, across the Great Sea."

Nerai nods, "We should take care of this here first." She looks at Maleb, "I can rig up something to let you communicate with us. I do want to know if Stormwind answers. And hopefully not with troops." She sighs and looks at Saeren, "To the Mountain then, you think?" She looks at Sookie. "You've fought them before?"

"I don't think troops would be a bad thing," says Saeren. "Unless they have gills."

Nerai shrugs, "THey might be useful, but if we can fix this with as few casualities as possible, all the better." She nods.

Kagarn tilts his head. "Nerai has a good point," he says. "Sookie, how is it that you know that Dagun's children require seawater?"

"Um." Sookie scratches idly at her forearm, just above her bracers. "Isn't it true?"

"It's a truth that my other companions had to learn through direct experience," Kagarn says. "Were you taught by -" he pauses, glancing at the human guardsman standing nearby - "by those you fled?"

Sookie nods slowly, and looks away.

"Let us return to Southshore," Kagarn says. "We must discuss our next move."

---

Maleb has his chin in his hands looking pensive. "So you're saying that the naga have a magical curse that turns the minds of its victims. And we're the next targets."

"If the pattern is followed, yes," says Saeren. "They'll turn you on your own, enslaving all of your people and killing the rest."

"What shall we do?" asks Maleb. "I doubt we can weather another attack, especially if they lose their fear of you and your allies."

"We'll make sure that doesn't happen," says Saeren. "We have yet to lose to the filth of Dagun. I don't intend on starting now. The key, I think, is taking the dwarves away from them. And killing their leader. Fortunately, we have the means and the will to do both."

Nerai looks pensive, "Well, we must find a way to fight the Dwarves' curse." She states, as if there isn't a question, "But we also have no intention of abandoning ou." She nos at Saeren, "If we can cleanse the Dwarves, then you will be safer."

Maleb says, "You believe that you four can deal with the naga by yourselves?" He looks skeptical. "They have an _army_. You saw it. Not just of dwarves, but of their own kind as well."

Sookie stretches a hand out, making a grabbing motion. One of the empty wooden chairs nearby is suddenly snatched up by a strong wind, and sparks of black lightning dart about it. She clenches her hand; the chair smashes itself into splinters. "I protect goshi," she says with hard conviction. "Goshi say fight naga. Naga suffer."

Nerai smiles at Maleb, "It certainly wouldn't be the first time." She looks a little more serious, "But we're not suggesting trying to kill them all or anything. There are... other ways." She gasps as Sookie does her thing, placing her arms over her head, "Geez..."

Maleb winces at the destruction of property. "I... well, it's clear that you four are formidable beings," he says, visibly shaken. "If you think you can accomplish this thing, I'm willing to take your word."

Kagarn sighs deeply. To Sookie he says, "I appreciate your dedication, but can I please ask you not to destroy the property of people who are _not_ my enemies?"

"How I know he's not?" Sookie mumbles, staring at her feet. She looks up at Maleb. "I find you another chair."

Saeren ponders the destructive power of Sookie for a moment and turns back to Maleb, "We've beaten them at every turn. They fear our coming, because we can turn the naga. It's a terrifying thought to them."

"It's all right," Maleb says to Sookie hurriedly. To Saeren: "Is there anything my people and I can do to assist you? Only we need to rebuild our defenses, in case they invade again."

"That is exactly what we need you to do," says Saeren. "Beware anyone who is unnaturally thirsty, and do not let them drink seawater. Nerai will give you a way to keep in touch with us. We're going to visit the dwarves and we will deal with the naga."

"We are grateful for your assistance," says Maleb. "I shudder to think what would have happened to my people if you were not here to intervene."

"Be safe, Maleb. I doubt they will attack again just yet. They are likely shoring-up their defenses to prepare for our coming," says Saeren. "I don't believe they know just what they are facing yet, but they aren't likely to be caught flat on their feet. Oh, if you find any strange chalices.. lock them up somewhere and throw away the key. That is how water is cursed by the naga."

Nerai nods to Saeren and wanders off, rigging up some communications gear for Southshore.

The magistrate of Southshore stands up. "I shall take my leave of you, then. If there is any other assistance we can offer, please inform my guardsmen. I must go to supervise my own preparations."
