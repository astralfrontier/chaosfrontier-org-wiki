Though none of Southshore's scouts or woodsmen can hold a candle to Saeren's skill, they are nevertheless competent at their job. It is not difficult to approach the gates of Dun Garok and determine what the dwarves are up to.

The gates are open only slightly, just enough that they could be closed on a moment's notice. Outside, several steam tanks are arrayed and being prepared for war, with dwarves bustling busily about them. Saeren, able to approach far closer than any of Southshore's woodsmen, can confirm that the dwarves she can see, and that have not taken pains to cover their necks, bear the trademark gills of the naga curse.

And after an hour of patient observation, Saeren spots something else. A human departs from the gate and heads north along Thoradin's wall. He wears dark, mottled clothing, and seems to be trained in the ways of stealthy movement - none except Saeren can mark his progress for long after he departs the gates.

The enemy Saeren follows is no stranger to the wood, but where he is a visitor, Saeren is actually a part of her surroundings, her nightsaber like a shadow at her side as they keep pace with their prey. Once the foe has made clear his destination, the time for silence is over. The time for shooting begins.

The enemy is brought down quite easily, his legs likely to heal, but not without aid. The noise he makes is troubling, but from the distance none of his friends can hear him. Saeren puts on a few finishing touches, a whispered promise of a very painful death and then the enemy is tied tightly and secured to Shade for the journey back.

Saeren heads back to meet with her friends and introduce them to her captive. "I'm rather curious about you," she says softly. "Why do you serve those who would enslave or destroy us all? Probably like all the other fools. You imagine somehow you can profit from it and not be destroyed later." Other than that, she says nothing to her captive before meeting up with Kagarn, Nerai, and Sookie.

By the time Saeren reaches the rendezvous point with the Southshore woodsmen, she finds that they have 'captives' of their own - a small troupe of dwarven scouts unaffected by the curse. Though not up-to-date on current events inside Dun Garok - they avoided their home when they realized that all is not right - they're eager to help in any way they can to reclaim their brethren.

The scouting party returns to find a war council already in progress inside Southshore. Before anyone else can speak, Saeren's hobbled captive gasps in astonishment. "Lady Perenolde!" he blurts, staring straight at Sookie - then blanches and bites his lip.

Saeren casually guides the tip of a sai to the captive's throat. "Go on, while you have the luxury of breath."

Sookie stops gnawing at her fingernails a moment and turns her head to look behind her in puzzlement.

The captive, trembling in terror, swallows as lightly as he can manage. "I... that woman, in the furs. She is the spitting image of Lady Susannah Perenolde."

Magistrate Maleb looks at Sookie in astonishment. "By the Light... I would not have imagined it." He turns to Kagarn. "How did you come by this young woman?"

Kagarn scratches his horn. "She was a foundling, living on her own in the forests. If she is a relative of anyone you know, she has not spoken of it."

"However," continues the tauren, "I can tell you this, at least. If she _is_ related to any of your nobility, it is under circumstances that she would not be aware of. Were I in your position, I would be more concerned with how this forest-clad man came to be in the captivity of our sentinel."

Saeren looks at her captive, "Tell us a story. We need to know who you are, whom you serve, and why you appear to be aiding the enemy of all who live on land."

Saeren's captive is far too cowardly to hold back information for long. As Maleb immediately suspected, he is a spy for the Syndicate. Once the nobility of Alterac, they were dispossessed after that kingdom betrayed the Alliance in the Second War, and now are little better than bandits and highwaymen living in the ruins of their former holdings.

Apparently, a few months ago, the Syndicate was approached by the naga, offering to return the lands of Alterac to them in exchange for their assistance. This particular Syndicate member's mission was to deliver a message to the Tide-tainted dwarves of Dun Garok, that the messengers from Southshore had been successfully waylaid, and that no reinforcements would be forthcoming.

"You Syndicate scum," growls Maleb, glaring at the spy, his hands clenching and unclenching as if he longs to strangle him with his bare hands. "Betraying humanity once wasn't enough, was it? Once again you return to your old ways like a dog to its vomit."

"Alright, then," says Saeren. "Your traitorous people will pay for what they have done, I promise you that." The night elf turns to the others, "There's nothing for it. We must send the airship for reinforcements. Our messengers have apparently been cut off."

Sookie speaks up. "Goshi, I take Syndicate man off for questioning? He not run from me."

Nerai looks sidelong at Sookie, "He needs to be in good condition when you're done, Sookie..."

Sookie bites her lip. "He not in good condition now."

Nerai looks back, "Yes. But he'll heal."

Kagarn studies Sookie, apparently deep in thought. "I would like to be present when you question him," he says at last. "The Earthen Ring does have _some_ limits as to what we allow when we question a prisoner." He looks at Maleb. "Would you like one of your men to be present as well? We are not familiar with your ways-"

Maleb waves a hand. "Do as you like. The Syndicate would stop at nothing if the tables were turned."

"You no need to crawl," Sookie says with a cheerful smile. Her teeth are very visible. She gestures, enveloping the captive in binding winds and lifting him bodily. She walks away, bringing him along.

As Sookie carries the prisoner away, a worried Kagarn in tow, the rescued dwarves are ushered in and are briefed on the nature of the curse inflicted on their brethren. Eager to help, they point out that the geology of the Dun Garok hills allow for a limited number of possible routes for any seawater tunnel - especially given the short amount of time they would have had to dig one. The most likely candidate, according to them, would emerge just beneath a rocky outcrop by the ocean.

Nerai looks at the dwarfs, "How much pholigston would they have stockpiled?" She asks, an idea suddenly comming to her.

The leader seems reluctant to answer - even after the reassurances of Magistrate Maleb, they have difficulty with the idea that a goblin would be helpful. "Ach... we keep enough ta run the steam tanks fer up ta six hours combat time each, under normal circumstances, plus enough ta run the fortress itself fer a month. But if they started generatin' more as soon as ye think they were cursed, they'd probably have at least twice that by now."

"Normally there's a limit to how much phlogiston we stockpile, for safety purposes. We ain't goblins, ye know. Or even gnomes."

Nerai smiles sweetly back at the dwarf, "Clearly." Is her simple answer.

"I think we'll want to seal the dwarves in their cave," says Saeren. "Cut off the sea water and give them plenty of digging to do. Do we have any ideas for that, Nerai?" After all, the goblin is the resident maker of explosions.

Nerai shrugs and waves her hand in the air, "If there's enough rocks in teh area, we can blast it shut pretty easily. And as our friend pointed out, they are Dwarves, not Goblins, so they probably won't be able to blast it back out." She pauses, "At least, not immediately."

"That's all we need," says Saeren. "But unless I miss my guess, we're going to need as many reinforcements as we can get. They wouldn't open hostilities on this level if they weren't prepared."

"Aye. The tunnel can't be tha' big, not on such short notice," replies the dwarf. "Should be easy enough ta cause an avalanche. Ye'd need one of us along, o' course. Unless ye're good wi' geology ta faind the fault lines."

Nerai smiles, "I've done it before!" She smiles, looking at the dwarf, "But any assistance that can be rendered would be helpful."

Maleb observes: "Saeren has a point. These naga do not seem to stint on planning. If the seawater tunnel is a vital supply line, it will be heavily defended."

"It will be, which is where I come in," says Saeren. "But there is much to be done. First, I will lead a force to seal off Dun Garok. At the same time, I would suggest the people of Southshore withdraw to the mines. There's no defending this place. Take what stores we have here and move as swiftly and silently as possible. Leave a few scouts to keep up appearances as long as possible, but only a few. Once the mine is sealed, I will go to get us more help. By then, Kagarn should have gained us aid from Tarren Mill."

---

The question of whether Nerai pilots the Defiant or participates in the assault on Dun Garok is solved handily, when one of the dwarves turns out to have a limited understanding of airship navigation. Though he is not nearly as proficient as Nerai would be, he is more than capable of piloting the Defiant to Tarren Mill without crashing into the nearby cliffs.

While Nerai is briefing the standby pilot on the nuances of the Defiant's controls, Kagarn has a private conversation with Sookie. "Sookie, my friends will need your help if they are going to succeed - but I cannot go with them. I ask you to go with them in my stead. Until I return, I want you to treat Saeren's orders as if they came from me."

Sookie bows her head. "I atone for upsetting goshi earlier. This is punishment, I obey gladly."

Kagarn's brow furrows. "I am not upset with you, Sookie. You cannot be blamed for mistakes that you did not know were mistakes. I am the one who should apologize, for sending you away so soon after having found me." He hands Sookie a token carved with a symbol. "This is the symbol of the Earthen Ring. If I die, look for someone bearing this symbol."

Sookie looks up. "Only die if you are attacked by dwarves. Goshi not die before me."

"Your mission is the more dangerous," Kagarn acknowledges. "But none of us should claim to know the future. Fare well, Sookie. By the grace of the elements, we shall meet again."

Sookie darts about until she finds Saeren, then kneels. "Roc'grare fel'tes fraht telsrah quin'mahk tadrom zela'von desh'noka tae'gel'kir, goshi. Kagarn command me to obey you too." She's scowling, but doesn't say anything else.

Saeren is a bit thrown off by this abrupt ritual, but decides it's best to act as if she's done this a hundred times before. "Very well, then. I am pleased to accept your help, Sookie. Oh, and there's no need to bow or kneel for me."

"Have to. Part of rite." The girl rises. "I fly. You make attack on dwarf outpost. I tell you what I see there. Nerai say she make communication thing. Give me one, I be useful."

"Flying is very useful. Can you swim, as well?" asks Saeren. "There's a tunnel under the water that the dwarves use to get sea water." The night elf goes on, "You're right, Nerai can get you that. It would be extremely useful. Oh, and one more thing. Can you do all this safely?"

Sookie grins very widely. "Nobody look up. Fool _you_ when you hunted me, night elf." She relaxes a bit. "Can't breathe water. But can move around."

As the Defiant lifts off on its dual mission - to seek help from Tarren Mill, and to deceive the naga into thinking that Southshore is seeking aid from nowhere else - and as the Southshore evacuation begins their march toward Azurelode Mine - there is one more mission to perform: sealing off the front entrance of Dun Garok.

Sookie overflies the sea entrance's location with Nerai's communication contraption in tow and reports back what she finds: a small army. Rather than facing these forces first, a decision is reached. The team will deal with the less guarded entrance to the fortress itself. Sookie returns, waiting impatiently for Nerai to assemble a demolitions kit.

Nerai looks back at Sookie, as she gets her kit in gear. "Sorry, your highness." She smirks, and has her gear assembled, slung around her in a pack, but perched on her belly for maximum portability.

Sookie scoops Nerai up in a swirling cloud of wind, lifts herself likewise, and guides the pair to the east.

Nerai points to their destination, as if Sookie really needed the guidance, and touches down lightly on the rocky tops of the dwarf's mine. Most of the prep for this was done back at the came. Now she simply needs to connect the charges together, and wire up the trigger. It is the work of a moment to have a safe (presumably) pack that she then arranges on the rocky outcropping to the large entrance of the mine. She takes about ten minutes in her preparations, finding suitable places for each of the charges.

As Nerai is putting the finishing touches on the demolition charges, she hears the telltale **zing** of a bullet bouncing off rock, followed a few seconds later by the report of a dwarven rifle. Far below, it seems that her work has attracted some attention.

Sookie growls. Nearby, one of the looser boulders that makes up the mountainside is torn free of its moorings as she gestures. The rock settles heavily between Nerai and the dwarves below.

There are a few more ricochets, and eventually some excited-sounding voices down below. It's only a matter of time before the dwarves mobilize to deal with the cliff rocks mysteriously moving by themselves - but right now, time is not on their side.

Nerai looks over to Sookie as she finishes up the placement, "Okay, that's it. We'll push, then we've got a minute to get clear." She nods as she flinches from the bullet, then stands open-mouthed as she watches Sookie move the bolder into place.. "Thanks." she says, in a small voice

Sookie releases her control from the boulder, sending it rolling downhill. "You say. We go," she announces, still staring at the dwarves.

Nerai nods to Sookie as she presses the button. "Now." She says, calmly, as Sookie and her are lifted off of the rock over the cushions of air they float on. going more up then over their attacker, the pair are well away as the explosives ignite, sending even the larger boulders rolling down the mountain. The majority of the slide falls in front of the entrance, rolling across the front of their fortress, crushing one of the tanks out on display in the process.

The dwarven riflemen are in no position to take any further pot-shots at the demolitionist or her half-elemental ally. Dwarves flee in all directions, either into the fortress or into the surrounding woods, and as the avalanche stabilizes, they are preoccupied with putting out the phlogiston fires in the twisted wreckage of the demolished tank. Nerai and Sookie are free to make good their escape.

While the pair fly back, Sookie clears her throat. "Hey Nerai. You're an orc, right? Type of orc?"

Nerai looks at Sookie, "Wha?" She looks down, "Er... No." She says rather shortly. "You've never seen a Goblin before?"

"Nah. Don't know goblin." The girl needs her concentration to fly two people, if her measured tone of voice and narrowed eyes are any indication. But she can still speak. "Be better if you an orc though. Orcs strong."

Nerai shrugs, "Goblins are greedy money-grubbing skinflints, who'd sell their own Grandma if they thought she was worth a coin or two." She says, bitterly. "Of course, I like to think that Goblins are strong too. I'll show you how strong I can be... later." She says, definitively.

"I see it," Sookie replies calmly, still staring ahead. "You destroy mountain. You not weak like I thought. Useful servant to Kagarn, like me. So I'll be watching you now."

Nerai doesn't really like how this last is said. "I'm not really his.. servant." She says, at last, after quite a long time of trying to figure out how best to approach this. She ends on that line, just totally unsure of where to go from there...
