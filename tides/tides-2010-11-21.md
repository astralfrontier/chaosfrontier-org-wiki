> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. The next major action in this campaign will be a mass combat battle for Purgation Isle."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sweet!"

> (OOC) Saeren shoots at the darkness.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "We may or may not get to the actual action today, since I'm fuzzy on the rules still (been lazy on doing prepwork)."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Naughty GM."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Let's just wing it! :D"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "But, for the log:"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Oh, Sookie. This rune you were learning from the spirit of the chalice - what did we work out, again?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "we didn't. I asked, I didn't get an answer. So I'll just figure it out on my own. <\_<"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "The rune is 'kill naga'. 0 FP, instant cast."

> (OOC) Nerai is back, sorry for the idle.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. In that case, I'll give you an answer. You can learn fairly quickly how to create a weaker form of blessed water, one that can quickly cleanse those who have been tainted by a chalice of Dagun. Purifying naga themselves will take you until after the battle of Purgation Isle."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "right, we got that far."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "In that case, feel free to start off by posing the recovery of the dwarves."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "There's quite a lot of them, by the way."

In the wake of the success at Azurelode Mine, Sookie has adopted the unstated intent of Kagarn and Saeren to cleanse the Tide-touched. One purification chalice will be slow going. After twenty minutes of silent negotiation, she returns the cup to Saeren and begins her work.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "more"

The girl touches the brow of a possessed dwarf. Her hand grows moist, and white patches of some mystic material creeps from under her bracer to supplant the proper human skin on her forearm. But the taint is lifted, and she moves on to the next one, ignoring whatever the now-cured Dwarf might say.

There are times when she has to rest: like the chalice itself, she lacks unlimited power. Like a tiny lighthouse in the midst of a typhoon, it seems like she must be overwhelmed sooner or later with the need for purification. But like a lighthouse, she continues to guide the way back to those lost at sea.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "go 'head?"

While Sookie performs her duty as she understands it, the mages from Dalaran have spent nearly the entire day interrogating Sathrin and her lamia friends, including the handful of new-fledged lamia captured after the battle at Azurelode. At the end of it, their leader declares that he is satisfied that their cure is real: the lamia are free of any lingering loyalty to the Old Ones they had served for so long. Jared of Southshore is skeptical still, but the humans of Hillsbrad have long respected Dalaran.

Freed of their bonds as well as their curse, the lamia have much to say, and most of it consists of intelligence regarding Purgation Isle. "There are about a hundred of our kind remaining, and about as many murlocs," says Sathrin. "After the defeats at Dun Garok and Azurelode, our kin will regroup at Purgation Isle."

The newly freed dwarves have something to say as well. "After yer people sealed off Dun Garok, the naga ordered the rest o' us here to Azurelode, but not all. There's a mortar company left over - about a dozen dwarves an' their equipment. If Sathrin's right, ye'll probably find 'em on the island."

Arrayed against that force are the combined Alliance military, mustered from Hillsbrad and Southshore - five hundred strong, consisting of light infantry, bowmen, and the rescued dwarven riflemen. As well, over a score of battle-mages of Dalaran, who already participated in breaking the Azurelode siege, have agreed to assist with the campaign to take Purgation Isle.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "In game terms, you have 30 elements of light infantry, 20 elements of bowmen/riflemen, and 3 elements of battlemages. Each element is 10 ordinary combatants."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "So wait... are they planning on blowing up Dun Garok?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "You already did all the blowing-up of Dun Garok that'll happen this campaign. :) That is what the dwarf is referring to."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Oh hur. Sorry. I'll read better."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Now I'm still fuzzy on the details of mass combat, but you guys have the option of fighting either as solo units, or attaching yourself to some other unit."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "If you attach yourself to a unit, you still have the option of performing a 'significant action' that turns the tide of battle, in the form of granting a bonus to the force commander's Strategy roll."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "actually, before I go any further, who here has read the mass combat PDF at all?"

> (OOC) Sookie <-

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Not me :/"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "http://asuna.memesis.org/gamebooks/GURPS/GURPS%204E%20-%20Mass%20Combat.pdf"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Thanks"

> (OOC) TidesGM volunteers Sookie's server n.n

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I'd advise Saeren and Nerai to go download that thing. it's a pretty big mouthful. And while you work on that, I have a question:"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Do you want to actually /use/ mass combat to resolve Purgation Isle? Or do you want me to roll some dice on my own and abstract it out?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "The main reason to use mass combat is to allow player decisions to affect the larger strategy - not PC ACTIONS, but player decisions."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Windows needs wget."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "If nothing that we the players decide (defensive attack, parlay, etc.) will really change that, or if we aren't being given command of the forces at play, abstract it."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I was going to say since none of us actually wants to be a general (I think) largely abstracting it sounds good."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Plus, honestly, unless any of the outcome can be affected by player choice..."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Indeed. That is what I'm asking. How much of a role do Brendan, Mutsumi, and Bill want to take in resolving this?"

> (OOC) Nerai is a closet grognard. c.c

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Saeren's only goals are: win with minimal casualties to both sides, so many naga can be given The Choice."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "This isn't really a Sookie thing so I don't care. Ezra would love to do this sort of business but currently lacks Strategy as a skill"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Is it strategy or tactics, Bill?"

> (OOC) Saeren has tactics, but uh.. 13 isn't exactly Eisenhower here.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Strategy for leading units"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "if you have Intelligence Analysis you can also be useful"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I have no strategy, so.. basically Sookie and Saeren can play murderous bastards, but little else :D"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Nope."

> (OOC) Saeren wasn't a general, was a frontline grunt.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. In that case, unless someone /wants/ to be a general, we will go ahead and abstract things."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Shade wants to be! (It's OOTS!) And just kidding."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Hang onto the mass combat PDF anyway, if any of you think you might want to be a general someday. Sooner or later I may /draft/ you, as well."

By general acclamation, the commander of the Alliance force is the mage-warlord of Dalaran, Lord Kian Morley. As night falls, he requests the presence of the adventurers for a strategy session.

> (OOC) TidesGM bah, finding myself stumped on how to proceed. n.n bear with me.

"Our biggest disadvantage in this battle is the sea," he begins. "The enemy can cross it freely, and we cannot, except for myself and my battle-mages, and time is of the essence."

"Jared, Simpson," he says, indicating the Southshore and Hillsbrad commanders, "tomorrow, your men will chop down all the trees you can. Southshore's woodworkers will begin constructing landing boats. My mages and I will assist as needed. By tomorrow evening we should have enough transport to cross the straits."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "You need help, GM?"

"The day after tomorrow, we will attack under cover of magical fog. The island is constructed as a spiral ramp to the temple on the peak. Jared and Simpson, you and your men will make your way up the ramp. If you encounter magical resistance, signal to us and we will deal with it."

With that, he turns to the adventurers. "Can we count on your help in this battle?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "If you don't want to pose, you can just OOCly say 'yes' and I will cover it. Kagarn will volunteer himself and Sookie."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "This is the King speaking, right?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Err, lord"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Yes. Lord Morley of Dalaran."

Nerai nods at Lord Morley. "I will be there, of course. I believe my companions will join along as well, but that is, of course, up to them."

Saeren smiles at Nerai and says, "Do you think we'd part now? Of course we will all go, Nerai. We must find a way to save as many as possible. The chalice will be needed there. As will other things we bring to bear."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Like Sookie's raving insanity, for instance."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "I'm not sure that's exactly an asset."

"I am at your service," says Kagarn, bowing formally.

"Excellent," says Morley. "Then you adventurers will be our troubleshooters. Kagarn, I do not know much about the ways of shamanism, but I understand you have the ability to communicate with magic?" The tauren nods. "Then you will be our point of contact. If my men encounter something we cannot handle, we will ask for your aid."

"Are there any questions?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "If you don't have questions, say so OOCly."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "They should cast fly on me n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren won't ask, though. Heehee. :D

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "They'll probably ask /you/ if you want it. We can abstract that, though."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All of you save Saeren have your own ways to cross the water, and Kagarn can ask Sookie to carry her."

> (OOC) Nerai thinks she has no questions.

Morley nods to the commanders and adventurers. "Then get some rest. We have a busy two days ahead of us. Dismissed."

---

It is dawn of the second day. The newly built boats still smell strongly of freshly cut wood, but the mages guarantee that they will be seaworthy. Each boat holds a score of men, with archers or riflemen manning the forward battlements and footmen on station to fend off murlocs climbing over the bulwarks.

The battlemages need no boats - their flying carpets will suffice for transport. Neither do the adventurers; Eecee is amphibious, Kagarn can walk on water, and Sookie can fly - and Saeren will ride to Purgation Isle aboard Morley's flying carpet, which will keep pace with the adventurers for the crossing.

The morning is clear, and Purgation Isle looms in the distance. But not for long. Dalaran's weather-mages have provided a stiff breeze to carry the boats halfway across the straits; now, they shift their focus. A thick fog wells up, seemingly out of nowhere, covering the island and the attacking force. "They may know we are coming," Morley explains, "but they do not need to know where we will land."

The naga have made some preparations, even so. As the boats draw close to shore, murlocs suddenly emerge from the water, emitting their familiar gurgling cries. They are quickly dispatched by the human soldiers, though the Alliance forces take a few casualties.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All right. I can drive for a while, but I think it's time for you guys to start being awesome. ^\_^"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "there go some of our red shirts n.n"

> (OOC) Nerai dresses Saeren in a red shirt.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "We're going to do this in a few phases. First, I want a round of poses for each of you doing something nifty to assist the landing. Then I'll pose the summary of getting everyone on the beach, and we'll do another round of you assisting the advance up the mountain."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Saeren, don't forget the fog on the landing - but be sure to ask if you want it cleared. Your forces /do/ have an archery advantage."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "That's okay, my focus will be distraction.. pose inc."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I want to fly away from the group for a moment.. and shell the beach, boom boom style."

Nerai's main role in the landing is that of anchor. Nerai arranges to land slightly before the boats, inside of Eecee, of course, and holds the line as the landing boats make their want and drop their charge. A squadron of Naga come across Nerai's guarded landing site, but all that is left of them are snake skins before Jared's men can get up the beach to help.. She turns, and smiles at them, "That's just the first."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "shell the beach? n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Shettershot."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Shatter, even."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Nagatraps!"

> (OOC) TidesGM ahso.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Then go for it. n.n"

As the target approaches, Saeren speaks to Lord Kian Morley. The time being right, the pair fly slightly away from the group, rising up through the fog until Saeren orders a moment's stop. The fog clears before her just enough for her sharp eyes to catch sight of some ill-concealed murlocs. She draws back her bow and begins to fire into the gloom and even as the real landing begins, her fire power tears into the positions to the north.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "If there is anything flammable here (e.g., huts) I'd aim for them too."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Are there any wood items ready to ignite?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Quite a few. The murloc huts are further back, but there are some wooden barricades prepared on the beach."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Manned by both murlocs and armored male naga."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "More posing n.n"

Not all arrows are aimed for defenders. Saeren diverts one shot to the wooden barriers, and another she shoots marvelously far, cutting through wind and fog to strike one of the huts. In moments, the fire of the arrows catches the structures, setting them ablaze. "There. That should be enough to keep them distracted for a time," whispers Saeren.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm above ur beach, burnin' ur hutz."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "here goes then"

A small white arrow darts out of the fog, but it's not one of Saeren's. Sookie has been cringing in terror ever since the mages of Dalaran made their appearance, and she's welcomed any chance to avoid their notice. Now is her chance. As one of the naga flee from a burning hut, she swoops past him, snatching him up in a whirlwind of elemental power and turning around to find the mist - and the boats beyond - and deliver her captive.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Nice! :)"

There seem to be very few sea-witches on the beach defense - the naga women are rather protective of their person (or "cowards," as Jared describes it). Myrmidons with tridents and murlocs with spears serve as little meaningful resistance to trained battle-mages. And soon the bulk of the Alliance army has regrouped on the beach, with Morley holding an impromptu conference with his mages.

"Any luck finding the mortars?" he demands. "No, sir. However, there are four spots warded against scrying, further up the mountain. They could be the mortar company, the naga witches, or decoys."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Did Shade also fly over with me? :D"

"How far to the warded area?" asks Saeren.

> (OOC) Saeren would have wanted it so, obviously. Maybe on a raft :D

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Shade is present. :) If he wasn't ont he carpet, he'd have been in the nearest boat."

"Here, here, and here," replies Morley, waving his hand at the beach. The sand whirls, reshaping itself into a miniature model of Purgation Isle, and a few spots glow with red embers." "I was just about to ask you and your friends to go and investigate. We anticipate considerable emplaced enemies along the ramp. I don't want to dispel the fog until we've accounted for the mortar team."

> (OOC) Saeren wonders how long it will take Shade to make that trip and get back. Want to keep the action going and do a scout move.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "How fast is Shade when he's trying to be sneaky?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "If he isn't sneaky, you'll be heard. There's a lot of naga and murlocs on the moutnain."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Land speed without sneak is 14"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Just says -5 to move faster than move 1."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Ok. So later on we'll have to explore the technique of fast stealth for both you and Shade. For now, about an hour to investigate with stealth, and about 10 minutes and a Dodge roll if you just want to outrun pursuit"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "right. the penalty to Stealth is -5 if you are moving at any speed"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Nothing on the mountain is anywhere near as fast as you. Dodge is to avoid the potshots when the enemy is lucky enough to see you. And at a speed of 14... one moment."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Plus they can't track if there are woodlands on this island."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Though it's pretty obvious where we would be going, of course."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "No woodlands. Are you taking the fast-move route? They're at -8 to hit you; -4 for your speed and -4 for the fog."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Yes, fast-move :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK."

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 15 (5 4 6) vs. 7, failing by 8

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 12 (6 5 1) vs. 7, failing by 5

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 11 (4 2 5) vs. 7, failing by 4

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 11 (2 3 6) vs. 7, failing by 4

> (OOC) Saeren wastes enemy ammo!

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "You pretty much get to all three sites without incident. (No ammo - this is them swinging tridents and throwing spears which they can recover afterward.)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "The first site is an empty decoy, the second has three naga witches, and the third is the mortar company. I suggest to you that the witches are a bit much for you to take on solo, but they won't necessarily have to know you were there either."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "How do you proceed?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm going to go get the gang."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. If you want, pose the scouting :) And then we'll figure out what to do next."

> (OOC) Saeren poses return!

Even with weapons flying errantly around her, Saeren is able to achieve her goals, finding the real camp without much issue. The mortars discovered, she races back to find her friends. She needs help to get rid of this problem.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Do I keep going, or is there anyone else piping up? :)"

> (OOC) Nerai pose.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I got one quick.."

Saeren spots the group not far from where she left them just a few minutes ago. "I've found the mortars! It's going to take all of us to clear it. We'll probably only have one good shot at it."

> (OOC) Sookie can be found cowering behind Kagarn and avoidin' Dalaran guys

"Well, the mortars should be easy enough to take care of, honestly." Nerai looks at her companions, "Probably easier than the witches, if we can do it quickly enough. We should go."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "How do you plan to get Eecee up there? Sookie can fly, but Eecee is a bit on the heavy side. :) How heavy /is/ Eecee?"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Very?"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "He's 'Large' size, anyway."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "gimme a weight in pounds"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "You'll have to gimmie a bit."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "if 'more than 1800' you are on your own. anything else I can do"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Honestly, I would have to guess Eecee weighs at least a ton. Probably a lot more. I'm trying to find the old source books, they might say."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "ignore the source books. how heavy do YOU THINK it should be? :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "If Nerai doesn't want to venture a guess, I will."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "ONE MILLION DOLLARS!"

> (OOC) Saeren sorries.

> (OOC) Nerai says, "More than a Ton. You figure Eecee is like a car, but made of (at best) Steel, rather than plastic and aluminum."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "k. good luck."

> (OOC) Nerai nods.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "GM, mages' Fly spell doesn't care about weight, only size, so we can do that"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Then so it shall be. The mages collectively can give Eecee a boost. Allow me."

Morley nods. "You, you, and you!" he says, indicating several of the battle-mages. "The steam armor needs a lift. Provide it!" Nodding, five of the battle-mages stand in a circle around Eecee. A glowing pentagram forms beneath their feet, lifts into the air, and closes around the steam-armor. And when the magic is complete, Nerai finds that, with an act of will, she can direct Eecee into the sky.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Done. Kagarn will stay behind to heal the wounded."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Yay burger-band-aids!"

"Go with Saeren and Nerai," Kagarn says to Sookie - he has been careful not to give her name in the presence of the Dalaran mages. "Obey Saeren's orders as before. I must remain to tend the wounded."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "k, let's make it happen?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. So... you guys' mission is to take out the mortar team, preferably with few casualties. Do it. :)"

> (OOC) Saeren poses.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "With the cover of fog, you'll be on them without them being able to fire the mortar. And they're not particularly tough in melee."

Saeren calls out to her friends, "What we're going to need to do is drive away the defenders and destroy their equipment. They don't look like seasoned warriors. They are relying on not facing direct combat. How should we destroy the mortars after we drive them away?"

> (OOC) Saeren Gets it going. :D

Sookie tentatively raises a hand. "I do that."

Nerai looks at Sookie, "Just be careful not to set off the powder when you do." She looks sideways, "Or if you do, make sure everyone is standing back."

Saeren nods to Sookie, "Very well. Nerai, when we get into position, you and I must drive them off very quickly. Preferably without killing them. Sookie will handle the rest and we'll make sure she's defended while she does so."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Let's doooooo this!"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "You guys need anything from me?"

> (OOC) Nerai is posing.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Nah, we just need to kick their butts. It should be pretty easy n.n"

Eecee draws over the horizon, floating in the air thanks to the mages. As the armor clears the ridge, she emerges from the fog, floating above the ground as Eecee is moved closer to the dwarves, brandishing the sword in his hands. Eecee makes no attempt to be terribly silent, instead banging his armored chest with the hilt of his sword. Eecee approaches the dwarves, and a few well-placed arrows thunk into the side of the wooden supports of the mortars. Once Eecee gets into range of the dwarves, not a soul of them is left, running for their lives rather than face the floating engine of death. Nerai calls out, "All clear."

"Move away from there, Nerai! Sookie will take it from here!" Saeren moves away as well, focusing on keeping the area secure. Until there's nothing of interest left, anyway.

> (OOC) Nerai obeys.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sookie! Now blow this thing and let's go home!"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "14 pandaren dies to bring us this information."

Sookie follows in the wake of her companions. She touches down gently. The mortars are heavy and metallic, it's true, but they have no will of their own. Were a dwarven shaman here today, the base metal might have drawn on the strength of earth, might have fought back against the storm. But instead, with a heaving and hellish grinding noise, the mortars are torn from their moorings and hurled down the face of the mountainside. A bullet whizzes by Sookie at one point, but she doesn't notice.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anything else?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "That should do it, I think n.n"

There is no need to capture the dwarves at this time - instead, the heroes return down the mountain, mission accomplished. Morley nods in acknowledgement, and whispers - and every Alliance soldier, including the adventurers, hear him say, "All forces, prepare for fog dispersal!"

All around, there is the clank of armor as shields are raised in preparation. Amidst the glowing red that marks the nearest burning huts, shouts of readiness can be heard.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Hua!"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "WAR! HUA! What is it good for? (Killing lots of murlocs!)"

Finally, Morley yells: "Battle-mages... fog, disperse!" The weather mages intone the spells of reversal, and in an instant, Purgation Isle is bathed in sunlight again. The nearest myrmidons and murlocs, from their fortifications at the base of the ramp, shield their eyes against the sudden brightness - and fall almost instantly under a hail of arrows as the human archers, already prepared, unleash their deadly attack.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Hua, indeed."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Also: Flare!"

> (OOC) Sookie NODs

And while the minions of Dagun take cover, Morley follows up with a magically-assisted bellow: "CHARGE!" And the footmen of Southshore and Hillsbrad advance, rallying around the armored bulk of Eecee.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "And at this point I've had enough for today. @\_@ We will finish the battle next session."
