> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I'm going to be working on poses to move the plot along. Saeren, Sookie, you here?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm back, was getting the kitchen ready for dishes stuff."

> (OOC) Sookie is here

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So, we are essentially able to continue from fade of last time?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. Which of you thinks you know how this is going to go? It does seem like something Saeren is more likely to be driving - Sookie doesn't exactly tend to seek out social interaction."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Yup. You're welcome to any starting point you want."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Okay, I will just kinda intrude shortly after that pose that left Sookie stumbling and covering her face. Does that work, Bill?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "yah"

The dark, broken lands around the tormented Blackrock Mountain have swallowed a sea of tears and are still parched. In a place like this, the suffering of a lone figure is rarely noticed. But Saeren knows pain when she sees it, and as Sookie stumbles, half-blind with tears, the archer follows. She is just a presence at first, moving in and out of the shadows near Sookie before speaking, "Sookie, what are you feeling?"

Sookie is reaching down for a sharp rock before much else happens - she's fast, and easily startled. "Go 'way," the girl mutters.

"I'm afraid I won't do that, Sookie," replies Saeren. "Not too long ago, I would have been able to leave you, but not now. When you try to push everyone away is usually when you need them the most.. and so.." The archer throws her arms wide, shrugging, ".. here I am."

"Don't need anyone!" the girl shouts, turning around. Lightning arcs along her fingers. "Clan now enemy, all die. Kagarn say he Horde, but he traitor. All we talk to is Alliance. Go kill dwarf enemies. Only people who they say they are is clan, and they bad now."

"We all need others," replies Saeren calmly. "And Kagarn is not a traitor, Sookie. He's serving his people. Right now, like so many times before, there's a greater enemy that wants to destroy us all. It's up to each of us to decide how we will face it."

"Up to you." Sookie crouches warily, still staring at the night elf. "I just glove." She holds up a hand, demonstrating. "Glove look like skin. Fit over hand. Move as hand move. But not hand. No bleed, no hurt. Just tool. No need anything but hand to guide."

"What do you mean?" asks Saeren. "Kagarn doesn't think of you that way at all, and neither do I." The night elf settles on a rock just a few steps away. "And your metaphor is broken. You do hurt."

Sookie shrugs. "Hurt not matter. I tough. Kagarn fix." She points at Black Rock Mountain, still smoldering in the distance, uncaring and blind to what lies beneath it. "Kagarn say, I do. He not say things that break me, he kind. But he still say, I still do."

"That's not the hurt I'm talking about," says Saeren. "Your eyes are showing a different hurt, something that is fixed another way." She looks to the Mountain and asks, "What would you do if nobody told you anything?"

Sookie thinks about it for a second. "I still go back to cave," she announces. "Cook yeti, make fur, sleep."

"Why?" asks Saeren.

Sookie smiles a bit. "'Cause. No monsters. Only yeti. Yeti easy to kill, no one care. Eat. Sleep. No dumb stuff."

Saeren actually laughs softly, "That's true. It's.. simpler, isn't it? Is that what is bothering you, Sookie?"

The girl scowls. "Sorta." She peers at Saeren for a few moments. "Not simpler. Um. Your language stupid, I hate it. Not right word." She thinks it over, muttering phrases in the elemental language of Kalimag. "Uh. Like.. rain fall, wind blow, fire burn. Just natural thing, right? Balance of elements. You very unbalanced. Do crazy stupid things. Dark Irons take captives. People not supposed to be tools. But cult make them tools. Torture, hurt, until people unbalanced. Then use like elemental slaves."

"Natural.. I understand." Saeren stares at Sookie for a moment before going on. "For us, natural is quite different. We are not like rain, or fire. We are ever-changing. You might say crazy is what we are, what we were meant to be." She turns away, "Why do you think you were told to serve Kagarn?"

Sookie shrugs. "Not know. Hurragh just say, go find shaman of Earthen Ring, join his service." She holds up her wrists, and the metal bracers affixed there. "Must obey Hurragh. Last order, change master. No say why. But Hurragh sad. Worried. She love clan, want best for all. Serve Old Gods and elemental lords faithfully, be rewarded."

"Sad? I see." Saeren rises and says, "Walk with me? It's not an order. You can head back to Kagarn your own way. You have to make the choice."

"You no give order anyway. Kagarn return to Southshore, order to obey you end." Sookie blows her nose in her furs, but moves to follow anyway.

Saeren nods, "Good. I don't like giving orders." She walks slowly, watching Sookie out of the corner of her eye. "Sookie.. what happens if you try to disobey an order?"

Sookie stares blankly. "No understand," she says, finally.

"If you are given an order, is it possible for you to try and disobey it?" asks Saeren.

Sookie shakes her head. "Goshi say, do this thing. I do. Compulsion on me. Is natural." She actually smiles at this.

Saeren nods, understanding, if not exactly liking the idea. "What I am really curious about is why you care about us being crazy. Does it matter?"

Sookie stamps her foot as she walks, and folds her arms across her chest. "'Cause! You give order. You bind natural world. You command elementals. But things you say make no sense. You order world into chaos!" She points back at the mountain. "Dark Iron work mountain. Clan try gain favor with Dark Iron so they go worship Ragnaros. Yes? But Dark Iron not just give. They ask payment. Help with slaves. Capture people. So clan send slaves to mountain. Why? 'Cause they dumb. They slaves to Ragnaros too. So why stop clan from seeing?"

"People do bad things, but not always intentionally," replies Saeren. "Sometimes, when we try to do the right thing for our people, it's actually the worst thing we could do. Some believe the only way to feel satisfied and right is to dominate and control others. It is crazy."

Sookie sniffles a bit more and shrugs. "That why it better to be elemental than dumb human," she mutters. "No want be human."

"Most of us don't have much choice, Sookie," says Saeren. "But we can manage it with some practice and help from our friends."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "phone.."

"No manage!" Sookie abruptly starts to shout. "You weak and stupid! You ask me human question, like if I disobey order, ask what I want. Not want to be like you! Not want to do dumb things! Not want to hurt and unbalance world! No make me human!" It looks like she's started to cry again, too.

"We don't just hurt the world, Sookie," says Saeren. "Watch us, look for what is good. You will find things that are beautiful in us, too."

"Nothing beautiful! All lies!" the girl screams, holding her ground. "What you do? Huh? What good? Don't even know what good mean."

"I've broken the chains of slaves, I've been a loyal friend, once upon a time I took great care of my family, before those who serve Dagun took them away from me forever," says Saeren. "I have made friends of many of my former enemies."

Sookie wipes her eyes with a hand. "I see you. You bring down naga. You make drink. They your friend, or they die. Confusing! Crazy! Stupid!"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "sorry, back.. phone call was heavy."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "good to continue, or gotta go?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I can continue. :)"

"Yeah, it is pretty crazy," admits Saeren. "Because I love my people and others would harm them, I must act. Sometimes, that means hurting those who would hurt us. Sometimes, it is killing. Our nature is not as easy to understand as fire or water. Each of us is unique, each of us must choose our nature, we have to decide what is right for ourselves."

Sookie narrows her eyes, staring suspiciously and blinking away more tears as they come. "I tell you once I want go back to cave. Why you not satisfied with that?"

"If it is truly all you want, I am satisfied," says Saeren. "But the real question is, are you?" She raises a hand, "They are called tears, Sookie. They come from our eyes when we hurt inside. But elementals don't hurt, do they? Elementals don't cry."

"I storm-type," sniffles Sookie. "Air and water. Is water. You stupid or something?"

"It is water," agrees Saeren. "But water doesn't usually come out of your eyes like that, does it?"

"Make water if I want," the girl protests. She holds up her hands; water, pure water, gushes forth from nothingness, conjured by the primal magic she possesses. "See? Also sometimes happen on its own."

"Yes, but this is different," insists Saeren. "You control that. Make the water from your eyes stop, if it is not tears."

"Not want to!" shouts Sookie. "Stupid hot mountains! Need water!" She splashes her face with some of what she conjured and captured in cupped palms, wiping at her eyes furiously. "Why stupid questions? What you want?"

"I want to help you find your real nature, Sookie," replies Saeren. "You are not just a storm elemental. You are far more than that."

The girl flinches, and finally collapses to her knees on the hard, hot rock of the wastelands. "No want to be dumb human," she whimpers. "No want. Don't make me."

"I am not making you be anything, Sookie." The sentinel moves closer, offering both hands, "Besides, I don't know how to be a dumb human, but I am willing to help you on the path to being yourself."

Sookie stares up, red-eyed and blurry. "But you think I not okay how I am," she insists weakly. "My choice not good enough now?"

Saeren kneels before Sookie, shaking her head, "That's not what I mean at all, Sookie. It's not like that. You stand in two worlds now, one you already know. Kagarn, Nerai, and I will help you see the other part of yourself. The part that seems so crazy to you now. We know that world, we have managed to find a balance there."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I will need to step away for a while soon.. so if we can transition in the next couple poses, that would be perfect. :/"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Brendan has already had to go lay down again - he's not feeling well. So we'll probably wrap after this scene is done."

"Hmph." The girl tries to get up, stumbles once, manages it on the second try - unwilling to accept assistance. "We see. You promise stop pestering me, I promise stop calling you dumb so much. But I listen. 'kay?"

"That sounds fair to me," says Saeren. "Let's go join the others."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Now I must run :)"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "there you go"

> (OOC) Saeren has disconnected.
