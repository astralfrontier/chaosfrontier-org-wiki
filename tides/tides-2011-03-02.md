At the urging of Darion Mograine, the combined forces of the Argent Dawn and the remnants of the Scarlet Crusade - those still committed to destroying the Scourge in all its forms - have formed an elite strike team. Their target is the floating necropolis of Naxxramas.

> (OOC) TidesGM has connected.

The dread citadel has been the linchpin of the Scourge's forces in the Eastern Kingdoms. If the Scourge itself were a vast lumbering monstrosity, then Naxxramas and its unholy denizens make up the head - the brain and the senses which guide the hulk in its activities. Without that guidance, the Argent Dawn hopes, the army of the dead will flail uselessly.

There is another consideration: at this moment, many of the newly minted crusaders are former zealots who until recently were under the sway of the Grand Crusader and influenced by his demonic plans. Shared sacrifice, and shared victory, may solidify the bonds between the Argent Dawn and the Scarlet Crusade.

Commander Eligor Dawnbringer is one of the advocates of this combined force; as someone with deep ties to both the Scarlet Crusade and the Argent Dawn, his 'Brotherhood of the Light' - a sub-faction which has long worked to unite the two groups - have lobbied aggressively on Darion's behalf. Some who have looked at the boy and seen nothing but youth and rash sentiment have found Eligor's arguments more persuasive.

The strike force has a selection of gryphons - enough to get the team to Naxxramas in three waves. Stealth is essential.

The entrance the team has found seems to lead into a den of spiders. And not only spiders - their ascended cousins, the Nerubians. And not only Nerubians - a mighty lord among them.

There are others here, such as a mistress of spiders and a massive spider itself. The crusaders emerge, battered but triumphant.

Many are the horrors of Naxxramas, and more than a few of the Dawn's soldiers quail when they witness the true extent of what necromancy is capable of. In the hands of an unfeeling, merciless and conscienceless master such as the lich Kel'Thuzad, all manner of abominations have been perpetrated like unholy art upon a canvas of human flesh.

By now the massed inhabitants of the necropolis are aware of the intrusion, and they marshal their fortresses to repel the invasion. While battling the Scourge's elite constructs, the crusaders are also mobbed by a steady stream of undead which add greater and greater distractions at worse and worse times.

Having slaughtered their way through a veritable army of creatures, the surviving crusaders now face the most determined of their foes: the death knights of the Lich King and their masters. Some of these are known to the invading forces of the Light, as they have been turned from paladinhood to a darker path.

And in a great hall, Darion and his allies find what they came for: the fallen paladin called the Ashbringer, Alexandros Mograine.

The elder Mograine is joined by others of his kind - death knights, former Knights of the Silver Hand, now corrupted and reanimated as the undead. Lady Blaumeux, Thane Korth'azz, and Sir Zeliek were all known in life as potent champions of the Light. There seems to be no depth to which Kel'thuzad will not stoop.

Now these four horsemen ride forth, facing less than a dozen champions who have survived and aren't also committed to holding back the other waves of undead. In olden days, perhaps forty soldiers could have fought a pitched battle in this hall; now ten must suffice.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Guess they couldn't make comp for 25-man."

"The only hope is the Ashbringer!" calls Scarlet Crusader Marjhan, brandishing her axe. "We must retrieve it!" Darion flashes her a disapproving glare, but spares further comment as the woman deftly blocks Blaumeux's attacks.

"You seek death?" laughs the undead Alexandros. "Then come!"

The crusaders battle their hated nemeses. And while Alexandros may have been one of the greatest warriors to ever live, the Argent Dawn has with them something that Kel'thuzad and his creations, his infinitely varied and numberless minions, his experimental test subjects and chosen champions of death, have never been able to replace.

They have the Light.

In a single thrust it's over. Darion collapses to his knees, cradling his father's lifeless body to his chest, weeping bitter tears as the battle rages around him.

The blade of his father, the blade which shares its name with its wielder, the Ashbringer, lies quiescent. Marjhan reaches for it, but Darion is too quick and too close - and, let it be said, still too wary to trust the Scarlet Crusade's motives. He takes it up, holding his father close. "We must escape!" he calls.

The deed has been done. Much of Naxxramas' forces have been destroyed. Once the crusaders can escape this chokepoint and rally, they can overcome the others. But at horrible cost. Of the forty or so who entered, these remaining ten are obliged to carry the rest of their fellows through the necropolis.

"We need to attain tier three to finish this mess off!" shouts one of the Argent Dawn's men, pointing upwards. Darion follows the gesture with his eyes, seeing a route to safety above the main thoroughfares of the necropolis. "Alright, men, everyone up! We'll hold them off. Use your healing magic!"

The lower tiers are still swarming with undead, but the crusaders attain the higher level, and with breathing room and time, manage to restore life to some of their grievously wounded comrades. And then the battle resumes in earnest.

Finally the halls of the citadel fall silent. Many of the Argent Dawn's best have fallen; likewise, many of the Scarlet Crusade have found their final end.

Marjhan breathes heavily. "I thought... I would die in battle... before I saw this day," she whispers. Darion smiles grimly. "We paid a heavy price already. Let's not seek to raise it any further."

Notably absent from the defeated is Kel'thuzad himself - the commander of the citadel. Where could he have gone, and will he return?

---

The crusaders' return to Light's Hope Chapel is marred by more news than the disappearance of the arch-lich. A member of the Brotherhood of the Light, Father Inigo Montoy, has also disappeared. Nobody can account for it, and none of the sentries saw him go. Could the Scourge have penetrated their defenses?

Far to the north lies the icy continent of Northrend. And in a citadel of the Scourge built within the ice and snow, Father Inigo Montoy walks next to the arch-lich Kel'thuzad.

"Your warning was timely," remarks the lich. Montoy merely inclines his head.

Kel'thuzad continues to speak, tapping his skeletal chin with a bony finger. "This news of the naga is very interesting. Should their plan succeed, we will need to be ready. Order the kvaldir to procure a few naga test specimens. We must ensure that the plague of undeath is as effective on them as on all other living things."

"It shall be done," the traitor replies.
