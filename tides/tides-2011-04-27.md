The fortified city of Tyr's Hand continues its fevered, industrious descent into madness. New walls are built, while old ones are thickened and repaired with stone quarried from the nearby hills. Human citizens, convinced they are the last living light in a sea of eternal darkness, keep exhausting hours and perform backbreaking labor. The flame of hope has been brought to them, and they drink deeply from the cup of Barean Westwind's oratory.

Doan, the librarian and archivist of the Scarlet Monastery, toils away at the collected scrolls and books the Scarlet Crusade has kept safe. It's important to keep the right works - not only those that detail the history of Lordaeron and its people, or those that provide insight into the Scourge, but also those which present such information in the proper way. Anything that threatens the fragile hope of the people must regrettably feed the fires which keep the populace warm during the night, when a cold wind blows from distant Northrend.

Scarlet Oracle Demetria walks the roads, speaking in tongues and making strange prophecies. Her loyal guardians accompany her everywhere; few others find her presence comforting. It is whispered that she has effectively been banished by Crusader Lord Valdelmar, currently the Grand Crusader after the unnerving events concerning Saidan Dathrohan.

High General Abbendis fell in battle against the undead; his daughter Brigitte has succeeded him in title, although not yet in the respect of her subordinates. Her fluted helmet hides red and puffy eyes, and her stilted stride is taken as a sign of military discipline by those who don't know her.

High Abbot Landgren has become fanatically loyal to the Admiral since his advent. His talk of a new sect of "ocean priests" has comforted some, worried others. Nevertheless his zeal is undeniable, and his majesty in the new garments of his station - a mitre and high collars covering his entire neck, ornamented regalia and white robes - give him a powerful presence.

The Admiral has begun other preparations: the gathering of provisions and stores for the Scarlet Crusade's fighting arms. The civilians under the Crusade's protection have been ordered to leave only skeleton crews farming the fields; many others are assigned to such duties as fishing the coastline (made easier by the sudden abundance of fish to be caught) and gathering salt water (which the Admiral proudly claims will provide both salt and freshwater when properly refined later).

Renault Mograine, once the favored pupil of Saidan Dathrohan, shows every sign of being taken under Westwind's wing as well. The Monastery's former commander fell significantly in esteem after his loss to the Forsaken, although most at Tyr's Hand have been told a different version of events. Westwind's aegis of invulnerability seems now on the path to restoring confidence in the commander.

And one night, Mograine is invited to dine at the Admiral's residence. Dinner is exquisite - a meat and sauce which Renault cannot quite place, but which is evidently well cooked. The Admiral is a highly intelligent man, although not condescending when Renault cannot quite follow the thread of conversation.

Good food, a warm fire, the company of battle-tested comrades: these things are the reward for living a warrior's life. Renault feels some of the pressure of command slipping from his shoulders. Surely, he tells himself, this is the humanity we're fighting for - when men may stand together again freely, without fear of losing their souls.

And at last, the Admiral pours himself and Renault a drink. The household staff has left. Only two of Westwind's hand-picked sailors stand near. The Admiral extends a golden chalice to Renault, smiling. "Drink up," he offers in a friendly, fatherly voice. Renault looks down.

The memory of that day comes to him. The Forsaken, that cruel travesty of a living man, handing him a letter. The contents of that letter, describing the infiltration of the Scarlet Monastery, and the chalice of Dagun. He looks to his left and his right. The sailors' hands are on the hilts of their swords.

He looks up. The Admiral is smiling. But the affection has gone out of his eyes. "Drink," he says again. And Renault knows that his damnation is complete.

"Renault Mograine to see you, my lady," the chambermaid announces. Whitemane looks up, smiling a bit. It had been too long since Renault had come; Admiral Westwind had taken more and more of his time.

The Renault Mograine that enters the room, dismissing the maid curtly with a wave of his hand, is not quite the one Sally Whitemane remembers. When some men are promoted into positions of power, they seem to gain something. This man is missing something, and she cannot quite tell what.

> (OOC) TidesGM has connected.

Still, if truth be told, Whitemane has felt like a princess in these last desperate times. Champion of the people, healer of injuries and diseases, beloved leader of the Crusade - her services have been vital, and people have come to depend on her. With that has come veneration, and the awe the commoners show her sometimes makes her blush with girlish delight.

Now those feelings mix together to form a new kind of dread. Whatever has happened to her prince?

"At your side, my lady," Renault murmurs, drawing close. Whitemane flinches back a bit, not sure at all what it is she fears. But Renault senses her hesitation, and withdraws to make space as well. An uncomfortable silence fills the room.

Renault withdraws a golden chalice from his pocket. As Whitemane watches, he fills it from the cistern of freshwater and presents it. "You must drink," he announces stiffly. Whitemane's eyes go wide with recognition, and fright. "But that's..."

"It's the Admiral's orders." Renault sets the chalice on the bedside table, and stares. "I have to observe you drink it completely."

Panic has fully set in. Whitemane glances about her room, finding her thoughts a sea of turmoil. Is there no way out? And as Renault reaches unobtrusively for the dagger on his belt, her will finally breaks. "Al.. alright," she whispers. "For you, Renault."

As the cup reaches her lips, Whitemane glances up. A flicker of anguished remorse sweeps over Renault Mograine's face. And as the last dregs are drained, he whispers. "That.. creature said it could be cleansed..." Without hesitating, he snatches the chalice from Whitemane's hands and wheels, striding out of the room. "Guards, to me!" he snaps. "Urgent business. The admiral orders it."

"But sir.." comes a voice - one of Westwind's soldiers, Whitemane thinks, standing outside her quarters. Renault's voice comes in reply. "The High Inquisitor is very tired and will be sleeping for several hours. It is done. We've no further business here."

---

Whitemane waits in the darkness. She received a handwritten message earlier, but anonymous - and trust is a precious commodity in Tyr's Hand right now. The infection of the chalice has long since been cleansed, and the woman fends off a fresh wave of guilt at leaving Renault behind. But he is well-guarded by the Admiral's own men. She cannot save him alone.

Fortunately it seems that she is not alone. From nearby, a voice hisses: "my lady, to me." A hooded lantern is briefly opened, and Whitemane sees a pockmarked face - a commoner of some kind. "This way, my lady," the woman beckons.

The pair walk through the darkened streets of Tyr's Hand, avoiding the occasional torch light or patrol. "Evil is afoot in the city," whispers Whitemane's guide. "When the maid saw Renault, she knew it had come for you. We can spirit you out of the city, but it is a terrible thing to face the Scourge beyond these walls."

"Never fear there," Whitemane answers haughtily. Some of her accustomed poise is returning. "I have dealt with those creatures before."

It is the other matter which gives her pause. Under the circumstances there is only one place left where she can go, and that is uncertain indeed. Aside from the challenge of reaching the place, her pride stands defiantly against the very idea.

Nevertheless, it is a refuge against the Scourge. Perhaps they will listen. Even if they have the disgusting undead as allies. At the wall, as she is lowered down by sturdy hands on a rope, Whitemane steels herself for the journey she must now make, and the place where her fate will be decided.

Light's Hope Chapel.
