By the time the adventurers complete their 'discussion', Brann is already having an energetic, if stilted, conversation with a diaphanous projection of a stone construct at the far end of the Vault of Khaz'goroth. "This is incredible!" says Chomsky, as they approach. "We're learning more about dwarven origins from this one construct than we've learned from every Titan dig site we've found to date!"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "more"

"While I am certain that is most fascinating," admoninshes Kagarn, "my companions and I have more pressing matters to discuss. Could you perhaps direct the interrogation in the direction of the Old Ones?"

"Oh! Right," says Chomsky, tugging at Brann's sleeve. After a whispered conversation - and another exchange in Titan - the projection indicates a large casket on the far wall, which opens in response to the gesture. Inside is a small quantity of fist-sized blue gems, each one a pale clear sky-blue, lightly faceted but still dazzlingly beautiful. "The Aggramar Catalyst," Chomsky translates.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Open to more questions for the Lore Keeper, if you have any."

> (OOC) Sookie is nominally asleep and thinks Titans sound pretty tasty with herbs when awake, so not much good here

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sorry, had an RL issue for a moment ><"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So.. I need to ask intelligent questions about Dagun ^^;;"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "And curse breaking."

Saeren smiles, thinking to herself that the dwarves may never leave this place. She directs her questions to Brann and Chomsky, "We want to know how to break the curse of Dagun. What can this teach us about the Old Ones?"

Eventually, with a certain amount of cursing by Chomsky at his translation device, the archaeologists manage to translate an answer. "The beings we call the Old Ones," Chomsky repeats, "are somehow built into this whole planet. So the 'curse', as we think of it, is more sort of like persuading not just your mind, but your entire _body_ to go along with the Old Ones' nature. To break it, you need something that the cursed victim can be persuaded to in exchange. That's what the Aggramar Catalyst is, really. It's a chunk of the sort of magic the Titans originally used to order the world."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "more"

"Dagun is the Old God of the oceans, so that means it's relatively easy for him to transform seawater into... I'm not sure if I'm translating this right... into _his_ idea of what water is. The Catalyst does the opposite. It changes water into the Titans' idea of water, in a sort of 'pure' form. Did you know we fleshy beings are over eighty percent water?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "To the extent that this didn't answer your question, feel free to clarify."

Saeren listens carefully and nods, "I didn't, but what you are saying is making some sense. Now, how do I use this catalyst to shatter this curse? I need to understand that more clearly. We have a chalice that does this, but we need more than that. Also, does this tell us a way to imprison an Old One? It seems that it would be impossible to destroy."

Chomsky poses these questions. "Well. Apparently the water immediately purified by the catalyst is very powerful. It says that if you run water across the catalyst, it only takes a few ounces of that water to counter the curse. As opposed to the relatively large amount you have to drink from the chalices." Some more discussion. "Unfortunately, this archive doesn't have enough yet to tell us how to imprison the Old Gods - something like the catalyst will help, but it doesn't know how to apply it."

The lore-keeper projection continues, and Brann gets excited. "Ach! It says there's a working transdimensional communicator on site!"

Saeren arches an eyebrow at Brann's outburst, "And what is.. nevermind. What does that let us do concerning the matter at hand?"

"I believe it means we can send a message to the Titans themselves," says Kagarn. "Ezra's notes say that he was seeking such a thing at Bael Modan, which did not have such a facility, but said that one might be locatable here. It seems the information was correct."

"We can talk to the Titans?" says Saeren breathlessly. "That would make this faster, wouldn't it?"

"One-way," Brann says. "We can send a message oot. But we hafta convince this contraption we've got a good reason to do it. It takes a lot of energy to send a message, and the Titans will only respond if it's urgent enough. They're busy beings, ye know."

"So we need to make sure our message is the right one to get their attention," says Saeren. "I think I want Ezra's skill for this. I gather that we aren't able to send messages very often, from what you are saying."

"Hang on," Chomsky says, after arguing with the construct some more. "I think it says there are some standardized messages it sends. Distress signals, if you will." Brann adds, "We just need something for this hunk of stone to use to make the call. It ain't exactly up on current events."

"So we just need to pick the right distress signal, in that case?" asks Saeren. "I would think Old Gods might be one of those signals, right?"

Kagarn says, "I believe what they mean is that the device requires evidence that the signal is necessary or appropriate." "Right!" says Chomsky.

"Would a cursed chalice work for that?" asks Saeren.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Do you have one on hand? :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "If not, one can be provided. I'm just curious if Saeren specifically holds on to one."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I thought we kept some. :)"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "For use as curse breaking chalices."

Kagarn roots around in his pack. "I hope it would," he says, producing the party's sample. "We keep one around more or less for this exact purpose - to convince any being or entity capable of analyzing the artifact to recognize the threat it represents."

After another brief conversation with the lore-keeper, a nearby pedestal lights up. "It wants to analyze the alleged Old God artifact," Chomsky says. Kagarn hands Saeren the cursed chalice. "If you would do the honors?"

Saeren takes the chalice, looking at the object with disgust as she places it on the pedestal. "I hope it is enough to get their attention.."

Colored lights play across the pedestal's surface. Columns emerge from around the chalice, deploying levers and arms of an intricacy that makes Nerai jealous, and the naga artifact is probed and analyzed from all conceivable angles. Finally, the probes retract and the lore-keeper's voice booms. "Old God essence confirmed," repeats Chomsky. "Artifact demonstrates evidence of collaboration with native beings, and is of recent construction, indicating Old God influence is currently active. Evidence: sufficient. Stand by for transmission."

As Chomsky translates the final words, the projection flickers out, and every light in the facility dims and goes out. The room is suddenly pitch black, except for the glowing lights on Chomsky's Translationizer. And the tinker buzzboxes, the communication devices Nerai developed for battlefield communication, suddenly crackle and begin to bellow in Titan.

Saeren winces at the sudden loudness of the Titan voices, one eye closing instictively while the other is turned to the direction of the noise.

The message repeats itself three times, then ceases. The lights come up and the projection re-establishes itself. "Transmission complete. Estimated response time: unknown. However, given rates of transdimensional travel and known dimensional parameters of Great Dark Beyond, median response time estimated as one Azeroth year."

As Chomsky finishes the translation of the projection's announcement, he says, "Now no one ask anything for a moment! I'm trying to translate the distress signal, and I want to get it the best I can!" He turns some knobs on the translationizer, and snippets of the signal can be heard emanating from it. Finally, Chomsky sighs. "Well, this is the best I can do right now: 'Old God corruption detected on ordered planet, designate: Azeroth. Schedule for high-priority review and _ombygging_.'"

Saeren sighs, "One year? We'll have to clean things up before then on our own. At least the Titans will respond by the time we've fixed it all." The night elf turns to Brann, "Is there anything else this device can teach us about making more chalices to break this curse? Or perhaps some way to protect people from succumbing in the first place?"

"Well, I expect that if we have our best alchemists, tinkers, and mages studyin' the catalyst, that'll give 'em some ideas on how to make more grails," Brann says. "An' we do have the formula for the catalyst too. If we can produce more of _that_, we can do all kinds a things." He picks up a crystal. "If ye drink purified water regularly, it'll keep ye resistant ta the cursed stuff. From what the Norgannon dingus here is saying, one of these in a well would keep the whole place safe."

"Perhaps we would even be able to purify Teldrassil with these crystals," Kagarn points out. "Though it seems we would need more of the substance, or some way to amplify its effect."

"So we know how to make more of this?" asks Saeren. "And what other things might we do with it? Could we possibly make a weapon that would work against an Old God?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "You already have the technology to produce grails, given a local essence source to supply power. Grail foundries are already at work in Tides' Hollow at Azuremist and Purgation Isle off Hillsbrad, and geomancers are working on maps to help you find more suitable sites."

"Well, we have a _formula_," says Brann. "We got that back in the Chamber of Khaz'mul. We just don't know how ta _follow_ it. On that note..." Brann and Chomsky have a brief discussion with the lore-keeper, which ends on an uncertain note. "I can't _begin_ to follow what this thing's saying," says Chomsky. "We're gonna need to send more archaeologists and lore scholars to work with it. But we'll get there!"

"As for a weapon that will work against the Old Gods..." Brann says. "Again, we'll need ta work on it. But this will be part of the puzzle, I'm sure."

"Is this the only thing of interest here, Brann?" asks Saeren. "Or are there other artifacts that might prove useful to us?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "A dangerous question since he's interested in everything here, I'm sure."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "The answer to that question is "what would you like?""

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Magical gear, armor, weapons.. things that probably wouldn't ever be here, come to think of it.."

After a brief discussion, Brann says, "Well, there ain't much else here that's _specific_ to the Old Gods or Dagun," he says. "But there's all kindsa things we can use. A lot of it's gonna stay here with the earthen, o' course. But we'll pack up some of it and see what we can make of it."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "We're pretty much done with what we can get /here/. I've got more, but not in Uldaman."

"Thank you Brann, your help has been critical.. even if we don't fully understand much of what we've learned today, it sounds hopeful." Saeren turns to Kagarn, "Is there anything else you think we should ask while we're here?"

Kagarn shakes his head. "Now that Ironforge has secured a route to this facility, we should be able to return, should we devise any new questions. Provided we can negotiate with the earthen, and I do not foresee any difficulties on that score."

"Well, _I_ got some more questions for the thing," says Brann. After a few moments, the projection pedestal is displaying a map of pre-Sundering Azeroth, with a myriad of glowing dots. Apparently, Uldaman's database of Titan facilities is a good deal more comprehensive than that of Bael Modan.

"Brann, does it show the purpose for those facilities?" asks Saeren. "I have a feeling we're not done exploring ruins."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Feel free to handwave the explanation and jump ahead whenever you are ready, Mike :)"

Brann carefully copies down the map, then rolls up the scroll and drops it into a scroll case. "There. That'll keep _me_ busy for a year, easily," he says, grinning. "Now here's the thing you lot'll probably want ta get to, in the end," Brann says, pointing at a large dot near the center of the map. "Uldorum," he says. "The capital of the Titans on Azeroth. It'll be near the Maelstrom, right in Nazjatar's backyard. Ye'll hafta half win the war ta even _get_ there, but if ye want ta finish winnin' it, I think ye'll find what ye need in there."

---

As the _Defiant_ touches down outside Ironforge, Crag Steelhammer is there to greet them again. "Kagarn! Yer a shaman, right? Then ye'll want ta talk to our newest visitor. Apparently, it's gone an' asked about ye lot."

The party is escorted into customs and into the meeting hall where they'd originally met with the dwarves. In there are a few tattooed dwarves, which Kagarn recognizes as Wildhammer - but those are not the most unusual visitors.

Around the table are several trolls, and a few orcs as well. Kagarn recognizes them as fellow shamans, and members of the Earthen Ring - but they are not the most unusual visitors either.

That title goes to the being at the far end of the table - a large, vaguely humanoid creature made entirely of flowing water, and bearing bracers that are akin to the ones Sookie wears. It introduces itself, in bubbling but clear Common. "I am a representative of the Duke Hydraxis," it says. "Do I have the pleasure of addressing the mortals known as Kagarn Stormhoof, Saeren Finblighter, and Nerai Escapement?"

Saeren's eyebrows flick up for just a moment before she forces herself to grow accustomed to the odd scene. She nods to the elemental, "You do, though the pleasure is ours," she replies smoothly.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Saeren RPed as making her first ever default diplomacy role~"

"Greetings, then. You must be Saeren. And greetings to you as well, sister of storms," says the elemental to the human girl cowering behind her tauren mentor-protector. "I understand you have been stalwart opponents of the naga, who pervert and enslave our kind to their own ends?"

"Yah," calls Sookie from her hiding spot. It's the first word she's said since waking up.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I need to afk a bit for food ^^;; back shortly!"

The elemental nods. "The elementals' relationship to the Old Gods has always been... complicated," it says. "Some, like the Firelord, are simply the Old Gods' catspaws. But we water elementals have always prized our independence, particularly those of us who serve Duke Hydraxis. Now that the mortal races have begun to awaken to the threat we have endured for millenia, we come to offer mutual assistance against Queen Azshara and her minions."

The creature regards Kagarn and Sookie again. "I admit to personal curiosity about the half-elemental who has joined your entourage," it says. "We were not aware that such things were possible. But this is not a matter for the larger discussion."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I've got something for Saeren, when her player returns."

Sookie mumbles something brief in Kalimag, but doesn't elaborate.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "back"

The shamans in the room straighten up in their seats, and the water elemental churns briefly. "Well, that explains much," says the water elemental, sounding grim. "We shall definitely need to discuss this in greater detail." Calming itself, the water elemental regards Saeren. "As a token of our cooperation, we wish to offer each of you a gift to aid in your struggles against the naga. Saeren, please extend your hand."

Saeren bows to the elemental, holding her hand out. "Representative of Duke Hydraxis, is there a shorter name I might call you by?" she asks.

"My true name cannot be pronounced by mortal tongues," replies the creature. "You may call me Tidemist." The water elemental extends its own 'hand' to Saeren - and as the hand withdraws, something remains behind. It feels like water, but it retains a vaguely elongated shape rather thans splashing to the floor. "This is a weapon, such as we extend to some of our mortal champions. It is known as a 'war wave'. Envision, in your mind, the shape of a weapon with which you are familiar."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Naturally a bow comes first to mind n.n"

> (OOC) TidesGM takes over n.n

Saeren concentrates... ans the water reshapes itself into an exquisite bow, taking shape from the sentinel's imagination. It is almost an exact replica of Diplomacy, crafted of water rather than wood and sinew. The 'bowstring' glimmers in the light of the chandeliers above the table. As Saeren puts her hand to the string, a shaft of water coalesces around her fingers, forming an arrow already nocked.

"This.. is amazing," says the night elf. "Thank you, Tidemist! With this, I will take our battle to the enemy in a way they will not expect."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So this thing works perfectly above and below the waves? o.o"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Yes. And there is one more thing."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Okay, raising weapon master to full is suddenly seeming far smarter than it was o.O"

Kagarn's eyes widen in wonder. "A war-wave! A weapon made from living water." He blinks, and reaches into a pouch, pulling an Aggramar Catalyst from it and handing it wordlessly to Saeren.

Saeren takes the catalyst and looks to the weapon she's been giving. She takes the work of the titans and presses it into the war-wave, her mind thinking of the two mixing together. "Living water," she says gently. "It's another friend to share our journey."

The crystal glows faintly where it comes in contact with the water, and the glow is quickly transferred to the watery arrow. Kagarn smiles. "Your arrows will now carry the blessing of the Titans," he says.

"Kagarn, this truly can turn the tide," says Saeren. "The gift of the Titans and the gift of our new allies will give the lost their chance at redemption and freedom."

One of the Wildhammer dwarves peers at the radiance. "Och aye," he rumbles. "I've seen that before. 'Twas years ago, when the men of the shattered kingdoms brought Magni that crystal. Made that sword of it. Now there were a weapon to shake the heavens. This one will be as well." He peers up at Saeren. "You best be a fit keeper for such a treasure, lass. The world will be watchin' ye now. If any weren't before."

"We will see if I am worthy," says Saeren. "I am following my heart.. I seek to save my new people and destroy those who would keep them enslaved. I have no illusions. The war we are in was inevitable from the moment Dagun broke free."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Bah, typo ><"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "please strike 'not' from that :P"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "fixed (viewlog 89("

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Thanks! :)"

---

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Does anyone have anything else to discuss? I'd normally have some time for Nerai here, but it seems Brendan's been detained."

> (OOC) Sookie sanjo

"Na, goshi." Sookie seems to have regained a bit of her poise; ever since her breakdown, she's been quiet. Now she gnawing on a leg of lamb. It's clear her manners have improved, as she only chews when not speaking, and vice versa. "Where buy dress? Like on Torn Book Page."

Sookie thinks a second. "Also, what buy? See humans exchange stuff. Got furs, maybe they take?"

Kagarn ponders. "A tailor's shop would offer dresses. In a dwarf city, it would be difficult to find a tailor with any wares for humans, although they may be able to create one from scratch." He rubs a horn. "A tailor wouldn't be likely to accept furs directly. Most of them deal in cash - money," he says. "Gold, usually. You may be able to sell furs to a tanner or a leatherworker. They would give you gold in exchange for the furs, and then the tailor would give you the dress in exchange for the gold."

Sookie purses her lips, eyeing herself. "Think I get much gold for these?" she asks, gesturing what she has on.

> (OOC) Sookie is wearing gray-quality starting-zone furs.

"That... well, it shouldn't be necessary," says Kagarn. "Our adventuring company has earned no small amount of gold in exchange for the salvation of Southshore and other places. A certain share of that gold is yours, and I'll be happy to help you spend it on whatever you want." He purses his lips. "I'm afraid I'm no expert on furs, but I don't know if you could expect to get much gold for your current attire. Especially not in a dwarven city."

Sookie frowns. "Spent lots of time making furs," she protests. "Where tailor?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sorry about that ><"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Ah, good, you weren't waiting on me ^^;;"

"We can ask around," Kagarn says. "Ironforge has many human visitors. There's bound to be _someone_ who will cater to humans. Or those who are human-shaped."

Sookie makes sure she has the Torn Book Page, then starts asking around, using the illustration as a guide. She hears about, and is directed to, a shop called Stonebrow's Clothier.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Anyone who think she's likely to get in trouble is welcome to tag along n.n"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Kagarn certainly will, since he's the one who's actually carrying her money. Saeren, you want to watch over her?"

A handful of dwarves can be found inside. "I'm Uthrar Threx," one announces. "Welcome to our shop! What'll it be?"

Sookie holds up the Torn Book Page. "Na, want dress. Like this one. With red and yellow. Exactly like this, only nicer. Um, also ribbons. Na, you take furs?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "May I?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "of course."

The dwarves seem taken aback. Before any of them can say anything, though, Kagarn steps forward. "Instead of furs, will you take gold? And you can refer us to a reputable dealer in furs and leathers who will have use for my friend's current attire."

Sookie starts to tug at her furs, intent on presenting them for inspection. "Good quality, you see."

Threx is having just as much difficulty in wrapping his mind around a tauren customer as he was with Sookie's uncultured Common, but he can wrap his mind around gold. "We havena got much call fer furs, lass," he says. "But yer friend's gold we'll take. Can ye step inta the back, please? We need ta take yer measurements." He looks Sookie up and down. "Also, it's gonna be a few days. We do have a few human dresses, but I doubt we got anything on the rack that's close enough."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Saeren? You /were/ invited OOCly to come along..."

Sookie is stopped from giving a demonstration of her wares, fur or otherwise, and shrugs it away. Gold will do then. "'Kay, whatever you need." And with that, she allows herself to be led away.

---

While the adventurers go about their own business, they are also requested to stay put. A group of loremasters, shamans, arcanists and other wise sorts are going to review the findings from Uldaman, and they want the 'local experts' on hand as well.
