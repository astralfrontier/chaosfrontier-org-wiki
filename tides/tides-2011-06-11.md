> (OOC) Sookie says, "go ahead and set up whatever you have in mind, if anythin."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I was thinking of a continuation from where you last were, if that works?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Or perhaps a dress pick-up :)"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'll set it up now"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "go for it"

During the time in Ironforge, Saeren has spent most of her time hidden away, reluctant to move about the city more than she must. She has, with some success, kept her dislike of being in a city to herself. To make this easier, she's turned her mind to Sookie's goal, the first step being picked-up the dress. On the appropriate day, the night elf seeks out Sookie and says, "Kagarn tells me your dress should be ready today. Would you like to go get it?"

Sookie has been moping around without much purpose. She startles, leaping from her perch atop some dwarven architecture, fingers crackling with electricity, before regaining her composure. "Sure, guess so."

Saeren knows the place only from Kagarn's explanation, but that is enough to avoid getting lost. Following in the footsteps of the two women is Shade, the nightsaber earning them an even wider berth, as dwarves avoid getting in the cats way with great enthusiasm. "Sookie, have you ever worn a dress before?" asks the night elf.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "What does Sookie wear on her feet?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "she's basically wearing multilayered yeti furs, including as moccasins on her feet"

"No," the girl replies glumly. "Dress in sackcloth with clan, then in armor. Leather, with metal spikes. Make own leather later from yeti."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Hmm.. I'm debating an idea. I want you to approve/deny it. What if Saeren also had ordered a dress so she could join Sookie on this journey into the weird for both of them :)"

"That takes great skill," says Saeren. "Wearing a dress like this will feel different." The night elf pauses to think a moment, "We're going to need to get you the right kind of shoes, too."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "no problem here."

Sookie peers down at her feet as she walks. "What wrong with these?" she asks.

Saeren looks at the mocassins, "Really, nothing is, Sookie. It's just that people wear different shoes when they wear a dress. Especially for dancing. We'll need to find some that will serve our purposes."

"No understand," Sookie mumbles.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "good time to get there :)"

Saeren sees what must be the shop and nods, "You will." She turns to the girl and puts on a brave face, "Now let's see what kind of work they do here!"

> (OOC) TidesGM has connected.

> (OOC) Sookie will follow along n.n

> (OOC) Saeren says, "GM is here.. Mike, do you want to run the dwarves, or is it okay if I handle it? ^^"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "we should be fine"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I'm pretty sure there's no sekrit naga plot that GM had in mind for the tailor of Ironforge"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I would like to reserve the right to step in if I think something needs to be altered"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "yeah, the hemline needs to be altered. get to it!"

The dwarven shopkeeper clearly remembers Sookie, which is to be expected. "Oh, so yer back with the furs? I think a few shops down you might be able to sell em." He turns his attention to Saeren, whom he clearly recognizes as well. "It took a lot of fabric to cover ye, elf, but it's ready. Just got the dress done this morning."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Saeren likes Sookie enough to face one of her greatest fears. Wearing a dress."

Sookie looks dully from face to face. "Huh. Why he give you dress?" she asks Saeren.

Saeren turns to Sookie, "Well.. I thought it might be good to do this together." The night elf looks rather uncomfortable, now that the dress is being brought to her. "Besides, you may need some help getting into the dress, and it's been so long since I've worn a proper dress that I won't even remember.. I doubt Kagarn will know what to do with one, anyway."

The dwarf bustles to the backroom and returns, cradling both dresses with the care a proud craftsman always shows for his work. "So, let's see how they look you, then."

Sookie turns, twists, and tilts her head as she inspects the dress. The ballroom gown that the Torn Book Page depicts is for a noble lady; what actually came out seems to have adopted some dwarven sensibilities. But the colors Sookie asked for are definitely present, and overall the garment flows like fire and sunlight. "Looks like it hard to fight in," Sookie finally observes. "But will try." She makes motions of starting to discard her furs, right in the shop's front area.

> (OOC) Saeren dies laughing

> (OOC) Sookie says, "she will definitely be trouble once we get to Stormwind"

Saeren is so stunned she needs a moment to react. "Sookie! Um.. not here. We need to go into a different room to try it on. Dwarves are very modest people." The shopkeeper looks a strange mixed of amused and annoyed. He finally settles between the two and gives Saeren a dubious look.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Your reputation with Ironforge has decreased by 350 points.."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "only until I get onto the mailbox"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Men of Ironforge +350?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "anyway, feel free to pose through the changing. this is a PG-rated game, so results are probably best. :D"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Yeah :P"

Working together, and ushered swiftly to a different room (the Dwarf was about to throw Saeren and Sookie until Shade's low growl changed his mind) the two adventurers are at last able to get into their dresses. Saeren's is not nearly as bright as Sookie's, but the light blue and green design works for her.

> (OOC) Saeren puts another pose in :)

While the dresses are well made, and beautiful in their own way, Saeren certain looks awkard in hers. "Yes, you are definitely right. We can't fight in these," she decides. "Best if we don't get rid of your other clothes, don't you think?"

Sookie is flexing, experimenting with her range of motion. Clenching and unclenching her fists, sliding her feet across the stone floor in a variety of stances, Sookie finally nods. "This no good for fighting at all," she concludes sadly. "So... I guess, no understand why wear."

"Because most people don't fight, Sookie," explains Saeren. "Dresses are meant to be beautiful." The night elf looks at herself in a mirror and shakes her head, "And honestly, Sookie, you look very good in a dress." The sentinel quirks her lips, "I think something is missing, though.."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "What does Sookie look like? Is there a full desc of her? :)"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "kiiiind of."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "That works."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So basically.. Saeren needs to take Sookie to a hair dresser."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "she needs a thorough scrub down since she's probably filthy too n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Good point."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "actually I got this."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Okay ^^"

The dresses are, for now, too soon. Saeren and Sookie quickly change back. And a few doors down, the mining guild of Ironforge experiences something unheralded in its entire history; femininity. "Coming through, all men out!" bellows Saeren, with Shade backing up the threat. Hard-bitten dwarves, fresh from a day's job mining the inside and out of the mountain, step aside out of shock. No mere bath will do. Both elf and human have enough traveling grime accumulated that the miners' special scrub-down pits are the only thing for the job.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "This reminds me of Spirited Away now n.n"

The interior of Ironforge is still hot from magma, and the cunning engineers of the city have piped some of the mountain's heat into mineral spring baths. Normally the miners use these to clean themselves and relax after a day spent hewing stone.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "'My skin is flaking up and floating away.' 'That's not skin.'"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I figured getting us to the onsen episode would save time"

Saeren peels off her clothes unceremoniously, getting ready to slip into the water. Someone, however, loves the water far more than she does, so before she or Sookie are ready, a healthy spray of warm water splashes out on them as Shade leaps in.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Yes, and I get to play a Shade quirk in the process."

> (OOC) Sookie electrocutes the wall to keep the boys' side from peeping

Saeren and Sookie get into the water a moment later. There's some education on proper bathing ettiquette, and a lot of cleaning before they are done. "Well, this has gotten us a lot closer to looking right for a dress," explains the elf. "Being clean feels so much better, don't you think?"

"Feels weird," Sookie murmurs, experimentally dipping her head below water. "Usually make water for mud. Camouflage. Wear mud. Eat when feel sick, get better. Feel... um, dunno. Less like Sookie, more like stranger." She buries her face up to her chin in the water, remembering events in Uldaman. "Guess that not so bad though."

"We all become different people as time passes," agrees Saeren. "It's what life is like for us. To people, being clean is viewed as proper. Being dirty is okay for a little while, but you are expected to be clean as soon as you can."

Sookie blows a few air bubbles experimentally in the hot water, then sits up a bit to speak. "Na, na. Thought.. when looked at Torn Book Page, saw girl in dress. Many people around her. Looked like old fighting practice, when I was training. Thought dancing sort of new fighting type. Thought I put on dress, sneak into Stormwind, like camouflage. If wear dress, nobody expect attack until too late. Guess that not right either, huh?"

Saeren shakes her head, "No, that's not what it was showing. At least, I don't think so. Dancing is done at parties, where many people gather to.. well, to talk and have fun, I suppose. There is a place in the room where people dance, and around it there are usually many people talking, eating, and drinking."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Saeren, expert of dancing."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Saeren and Sookie should invent capoeira."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "We might, if the dance outing goes poorly."

The girl splashes her hand against the water, a little angrily. "But there fighting to do. Why people stand around talking and wasting time? No one ever do this in clan. We worship, spend time fight practice, summon elemental, eat mushroom that grow in certain cave. Sometime people start scream, be carried away, but they come back, feel better. No stand around and talk. If stand arond, listen to sermon about Old Gods."

Saeren isn't sure where to begin after hearing that. "Well, I'm sure that was good for your clan, but that's not the way most people live, Sookie. There is prayer and worship, but also a lot of other things. Work, having fun, resting, enjoying each other's company. Are you having fun right now?"

"Turnin wrinkly right now," Sookie answers, staring at her hand. "This what getting old like?"

Saeren laughs, "I suppose, but in this case, the wrinkles will go away once you are dry for a while." The night elf leans back, letting out a sigh, "This warm water is something I could get used to, anyway. But back to the point. Life is about a lot of things, Sookie. I think it's time I show you some of that."

"Guess." The girl shrugs a little, and turns about in the water. "Feel like... when I very young." She crouches herself into a ball, hugging her knees under the water's surface. "Hurragh take care of me. I hear screaming outside, I start screaming too. She pick me up and hold me, run hand through hair, say it alright. Always tell me it be okay. Always was." The girl shivers a little. "Water feel warm like that."

Saeren reaches out, touching Sookie's hair. "She's right, it will be alright." The night elf shows no hurry to leave the water, since Sookie is enjoying it. "After we're done, we're going to find a place to eat," she decides.

"You ladies done in there yet?" bellows a distant dwarven voice.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "troublesome dwarven miners, always wanting what's theirs n.n"

Saeren laughs at the inquiry and rises from the water, "I guess it's time for us to leave." She dries herself off as swiftly as she can, and decides to put on the dress. "We might as well get used to this kind of thing," she explains. Shade follows the night elf only after some protest, the animal grumbling as it leaves the water behind.

Sookie follows suit, almost putting on the new dress before remembering that she's still damp. Toweling off with the miners' rough cloth towels, she struggles her own way into her new dress and borrows a towel for her hair. "Coming out now!" she calls to the dwarves. After a moment's hesitation, she follows it with: "thank you for letting us use it!"

Saeren is surprised by the politeness, but follows suit, "Yes, thank you!" Shade shows gratitude with a nose bump that startles the miners to no end. With their old clothes packed away, the two set out in search of an inn. A few stops for directions later they arrive at an inn with seats that will at least work for Sookie, but cause Saeren a little challenge. "I haven't eaten much dwarven fare before, honestly," admits the night elf. "But I am sure we can find something to our liking."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sookie can't read, can she?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "she's not illiterate, just uncouth"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Okay ^^"

> (OOC) Saeren says, ".. are these dwarven cookies made with real dwarves? Just waiting for it.."

"Uhm.." Sookie puzzles over options. "Na, how about venison?" she suggests.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "she's gonna be useless for catering."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I have no idea what kind of food dwarves eat.. I assume bread and potatoes, like germans n.n"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "probably yeah"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "And beer n.n"

Saeren doesn't see anything terribly familiar, so she does the natural thing and orders something for both herself and Sookie based on what others are eating. It looks good enough to her eyes. "Since we're here, we might as well try something new, right? I didn't notice an option for venison, anyway."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm wondering just how much of a scene we make together."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "GM's call, I guess :)"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "but until then:"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "German or Scottish cuisine seems plausible. There may even be haggis."

What arrives in front of Sookie is a plate of mountain potatoes, goatsmeat from the hardy mountain stock that live on the snow-capped mountains around Ironforge, covered in a hearty herb-seasoned gravy. Diced carrots and snow-cold beer round off the meal. Sookie stares at the miniature mountain with bulging eyes. "Na, Saeren. I think I grow beard if I eat all this," she whispers.

The night elf isn't certain herself about the portion size. "How is it that they stay so small?" she murmurs to herself. She works at the vegetables with some enthusiasm, but it's clear she's not accustomed to this. "It's actually not bad, really," she decides. "Not what we're used to, of course.. but it's far better than some of the places we've been."

Sookie glances about, then leans over very carefully. She's at a very real risk of accidentally dipping her dress in the gravy without caution, and the dirty stains on the innkeeper's apron put her in mind of her own garment's condition. "How you eat in this?" she whispers after a few bites. "Fur easy to clean, just get wet, then dry."

Saeren laughs, taking a fork and showing Sookie how to hold it. "You use this to pick up your food." She then shows Sookie how to use the spoon, "For soup, you would use this. For what we're eating now, though, a fork will work." Next, she shows how to use the knife and fork together. "Using these will help you, and is part of good manners."

Sookie manages to poke herself in the mouth for the first couple of bites, and winces. But the rest seems to go smoothly. She does try some of the beer, and makes a sour face. But it doesn't seem too disagreeable, since she finishes the rest off with her potatoes.

Saeren avoids the beer after a small drink of it. She clearly prefers water to this choice. "It becomes easier to practice," she assures Sookie. "So now we just need to find someone to teach dancing, right?"

"'Guess," Sookie says. To her credit she swallowed her carrots first, though she's still taking them in at a good clip around words. "Na, dwarf dance like human dance? What elf dance like?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "'It's Michael Jackson, but for girls it looks like this French pop singer.' 'What?' 'Nevermind.'"

> (OOC) Saeren dies

Saeren does her best to teach as she goes. "Oh, and when we eat, we should only talk when there is no food in our mouths. Also, eating slowly is considered proper. You'll notice a lot of rules, but once you get used to it, it's pretty easy." The night elf admits, "I don't know much about dancing among humans or dwarves. I think most of the dances are similar when it comes to formal events. I am hoping we can find a human who might teach us. A dwarf would be rather challenging to dance with."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Since they are roughly waist height and all.."

Sookie hums aloud. "Goshi too tall. Nerai too small. Eecee too.. big." She scowls a bit. "Na, find human in Ironforge. Must be one."

Saeren nods quickly, "Exactly the problem," she agrees. "I'm sure we'll have some luck.. we just need to find the right person to ask." The night elf starts with the innkeeper, who asks around for her in turn. While it's not the fastest result, eventually a name is given with some directions to get there.

The first candidate for dancing lessons is a woman named Deliana, who is urgently seeking an audience with King Magni Bronzebeard. Although she refuses to teach anything - "I'm far too busy, I'm sorry" - she does take a shine to Sookie's elemental binding bracers, and informs her that she could supply superior versions of them, if the two would just go to Winterspring. This looks like a dead end.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "argh"

> (OOC) Saeren cackles.

The second lead is a man named Alexander Calder, who holds forth at a little shop in the Forlorn Cavern of Ironforge - a row of shops and insular residences with an evil reputation among the fairer citizens of the city. When he sees Sookie and studies her for a few moments, a sly grin slides across his face. "Of course I can teach you. I can teach you many things, girl, and with my power we will achieve our masters' true objectives." Saeren concludes that this probably isn't a good prospect for dancing lessons, and hustles Sookie out.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "he is the warlock trainer in IF. ^\_^"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Yeah, that could cause trouble. Especially if she recognizes the Twilight's Hammer gang signs."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I just learned she's still waiting on the King.. good luck with that .\_."

> (OOC) Saeren makes a note to use ninja skills vs. Alexander on her way out of IF.

Across the city the two women find what might be the safest bet, even if he can't dance at all. Among the dwarves there is a human army man, a Corporal Carnes. From what Saeren and Sookie can find out, he's been tasked with some part of the nascent war effort against the naga - collection of iron resources and logistics, or something along those lines. But he has a good reputation, and he has time to speak to two of the travelers who have been fighting against the naga for so long.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "and since GM is punting on running him..."

> (OOC) Saeren snerks

"Good day, you two," Carnes smiles, after his two visitors are announced by a gnomish clerk. "Thank you, both of you, for all the hard work that you've done on behalf of Azeroth. How may I help you?"

Saeren looks to Sookie, then back to Carnes. "Thank you, as well. We're just doing what we feel was right. Actually, I am here to help my friend Sookie. We want to learn how to dance in the fashion of your people." She can't help but feel ridiculous requesting this.

"D.. dance?" the Corporal asks. It's like pushing a rider off a horse and watching him try to stand up again. "So, er.. when you say dance, you mean actually, ah, _dance_?"

"Yes, precisely that," says Saeren. She doesn't mention the fact that she towers over the man, herself. At least for Sookie his height is appropriate.

"Well, listen. This iron isn't going to mine itself." Carnes gestures at the paperwork at his desk. "And the naga... " He stops. "You know what? My father served under Count Ridgewell. And I'm pushing papers for dwarves. We're going dancing!" He calls to his gnomish assistant: "Curry! You get to test out your papertronic shufflizer after all!"

Saeren laughs at the sudden burst of enthusiasm. "I'm delighted that you can help us. The naga.. well, we'll have time for them afterwards. If we don't live our lives, what's the point of winning battles, right?"

Off from the central hub of Ironforge, innumerable chambers and tunnels are stretched out - places for the thousands of dwarves who live here to eat, drink, and congregate. The Senate of Ironforge holds its chambers open for special occasions, and Carnes doesn't have much trouble exercising his limited authority over the two porters who stand guard in front of the ballroom. "There's a music player over here," he explains, crossing the hall and fumbling at the controls of an apparatus of gnome or dwarven origin. The correct sequence of levers and dials yields a stately-sounding orchestral piece that wafts through the hall. "There. Now, uh.. what, uh, how do you want to proceed?"

"Well, I believe the best thing is to give Sookie the general idea, and then teach her how it is done," suggests Saeren. "I have no great skill for this, but when the day started I knew that dancing wasn't a fighting technique."

Carnes thinks about this. "Alright. If what I heard was true, you're a fighting Sentinel from Darnassus, and this girl is.. some sort of elemental magic user, right?" He steps gingerly toward Sookie, waiting there in her dress, and slips an arm around her waist. He's rewarded as the crackle of lightning surrounds his body, lifting him away from the scowling girl. "No touch!" she shouts.

"Sookie, dancing requires touching," says Saeren swiftly. She looks to Carnes, "I know my height is an issue, but.. maybe show her with me first?"

"No.. I got this," croaks Carnes, dangling in midair. He manifestly does not have this.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "He's just afraid of dealing with a night elf, I think. :D"

Sookie carefully lets the man down on Saeren's orders, and Carnes takes a few experimental breaths. Everything seems in order, and his shock and fright from a moment ago fade from his face. "Alright. Stories were true," he concludes aloud. "Sookie, right? If you know about elemental magic, then..." He thinks a moment, then clasps his fingers together. "Imagine water. The flow of water, like a river. Imagine that river slowly running downstream. Only it's not downstream - it's around this room. You and I, Sookie, are going to be the water, together. We will swirl around each other, like an eddy." He makes a spinning gesture with his fingers. "And other people in the room will be doing the same. And the music is our current. Sometimes slow, sometimes fast. Do you understand?"

"Guess so," mumbles Sookie after a few seconds. "Show with Saeren, I see."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Ezra's still holding out to become a manga character. That way he gets a dragon girlfriend in human/elf form, since every other male manga character has one"

Saeren was just feeling that she had got herself off the hook, too! The night elf steps forward, looking odd in her shyness. Still, to help a friend she will face this fear. She takes the offered hand of Carnes, both of them working hard not to laugh at the absurdity of their situation. The very top of Carnes head does just reach the night elf's shoulder level.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Hahahah"

> (OOC) Saeren rolls just to see something :D

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d for 12 (2 6 4)

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Ooohhh fail!"

Saeren's dancing, even with Carnes lead, is hardly as fluid as it ought to be. She murmurs several apologies for trodding on the man's feet. She keeps looking down, as well, which earns her a quick order of, "Chin up! Let's show her properly."

After a few minutes, Saeren has apparently gotten the hang of things, which serves as enough to give Sookie the general idea. Finally, Carnes releases the night elf, looking rather relieved to have survived the experience with his feet only somewhat injured. "So, that is what dancing looks like." Saeren mutters quietly, "More or less.."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "At least I didn't crit fail n.n"

Carnes turns to Sookie, holding out a hand. He's not going to be so swift to rush in and take hold of her, this time. "Are you ready to try, now?" she asks.

Sookie's face registers considerable doubt, but she steps forward, willing to at least try. "Careful with dress," she warns.

Carnes takes hold of Sookie a bit warily. When he's not immediately thrown across the room, however, he seems to regain his confidence. His lead is a confident one, and, after the sore feet that Saeren inflicted upon him, he starts slowly with the steps. "When I step forward, you need to step back, when I step to the right, you follow to your left."

Sookie nods carefully. The music that's playing has had time to restart itself, and she misses some steps trying to listen for it.

Carnes shows great patience, making sure that every time Sookie mis-steps, she is given a chance to catch-up again. "Keep your eyes up," he says kindly. "Dancing is about listening to the music and flowing like water across the floor. Together we move." Though he might deny it, Saeren observes that Carnes appears to be quite good at this art.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sookie is actually dancing :)"

Sookie scowls. "Too hard," she says finally, sounding frustrated. "You move feet this time. I do this."

The girl wiggles a little bit, making sure Carnes' grasp is firm, then begins to move again, listening to the music. This time, she takes hold of herself and him, animating them both with her power over the storm. Small sparks of lightning dance across the pair's skin, and slight gusts of wind toy at the dress and the corporal's uniform. As she picks up the pace a bit, the dancers' feet actually leave the floor of the ballroom. Sookie carries them along an invisible current, eyes shut, listening only to the music. "Yah, like this," she concludes after a minute, as the two touch down.

Carnes takes it all with remarkable calm. Or perhaps he was simply nervous to the point of inaction. He looks pleased to be back on the ground. "That is certainly a unique approach to dancing," he says at last. Saeren claps her hands together, "That was great, Sookie! Even before the last part. You were doing so well for your first time dancing."

Sookie frowns a bit. "Feet not move right," she confesses. "Feel weird. Keep feeling like grappling, resist urge to punch and bite."

"Well, we can work on that," says Saeren. Carnes quickly chimes in, "Just as well that you didn't give in to that urge today. But it is true. You did very well. It takes time to learn things like this, you need to be patient."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Indeed, since the point of this outing was to learn to dance, it's very appropriate for Sookie to put a free point into Dancing."

> (OOC) Sookie will be doin so yeah

Saeren and Sookie take their leave of Carnes. Saeren thanks the man profusely for the help, perhaps all the more because she stepped on his feet so often. With Shade trailing them they return to their quarters to meet Kagarn once more.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Both of them in dresses?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "yaeh"

Kagarn knew what the purpose of this errand was, of course. But actually seeing the results is something else altogether. The tauren regards both of them with slack-jawed amazement for several seconds, before he finally coughs, and says, "You look... very different. Both of you. Almost as if you were entirely different people."

Saeren can't help but blush at the comment. "You should have seen Sookie's dancing, Kagarn. You can be very proud of her."

"Na, goshi," Sookie says proudly. "I no fight today! Could use some more stuff for dress. Saw some ribbons, can I buy?"

Kagarn is still nonplused. "C-certainly, Sookie. Whatever you see fit." He relaxes a little, and takes note of other details, such as her clean face and hair. Evidently Saeren has been showing her more of civilization than attire and dancing.

> (OOC) TidesGM fixes

Sookie bobs her head in agreement. "Oh, also saw serrated blades too. For cutting, trees I think. But probably throwable. Probably take naga head right off. And..."
