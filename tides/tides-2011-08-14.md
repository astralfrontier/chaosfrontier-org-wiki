> (OOC) Log "Tides-2011-08-14" started by TidesGM at Sun Aug 14 01:59:53 2011 CDT (OOC)

Night falls over Stranglethorn Vale. The twitter of birdsong that fills the jungle during the day slowly gives way to the croaks and rattles of the night creatures. Darkness falls quickly - except around a campfire amidst the tumbled-down, stained limestone ruins that were once part of the city of Mizjah, a port city of the great troll Gurubashi Empire.

This campfire was not set by trolls. The Mizjah ruins are inhabited by a tribe of Mosh'Ogg ogres, and this particular campfire plays host to a small group of the brutish creatures, with a half-eaten raptor carcass lying beside them, the results of the day's hunting. The ogres trade simple-minded banter in their guttural tongue, while occasionally slapping at the myriad biting insects that infest the Vale.

One of the ogres suddenly seems to take offense at one of his companions' jibes. Rising to his feet, he bellows a challenge and bowls his neighbor over with a punch that echoes off the ruins' walls. Before the other can shake off the blow, the offended ogre charges after him in a rage.

The others of their band rise to their feet and try to subdue the aggressor, but he seems to fight with an unholy rage, his eyes glowing in the firelight, his yells quickly losing what little command of speech they once had. The other ogres, in the midst of the brawl that has just erupted, don't even notice that their companion-turned-berserker has begun to foam at the mouth - until he suddenly falls over.

Getting to their feet, the ogres gather around their fallen comrade, one of them lowering his head to the other's barrel chest for a moment. He begins to stand up, an expression of surprise and alarm on his face - and then the light dims in his eyes and he falls across his companion's body, a feathered spear protruding from his back.

The ogres suddenly whirl around, back to back, finally realizing that they are under attack, but even with the fire at their back, they can see only darkness in the midst of the jungle. Until a patch of darkness detaches itself from the shadows and charges the nearest ogre. The behemoth moves with surprising speed, but he is still no match for the lightning-quick reflexes of the troll - for troll it proves to be, as its axe buries itself in the ogre's thick skull.

The battle is short, and one-sided; for these are no ordinary fighting trolls, but the dreaded shadow hunters, trolls who have made pacts with the _loa_ animal gods of the jungle to lend voodoo magic to their formidable fighting prowess. Strong and tough as they are, the slow-witted ogres have no chance.

In and of itself, the battle would not seem unusual - the trolls and ogres have been fighting for dominance over the ruins of the Gurubashi empire ever since the ogres first arrived through the Dark Portal with their orcish home-brothers. But the sharp-eyed observer would notice a few subtle differences. For one, the trolls' axes, instead of the usual granite and obsidian, are made of a pinkish coral. Few species of coral are hard enough to shape into effective weapons; indeed, almost no coral on Azeroth is suitable for the purpose, save those that are mutated by the magical energies of the Maelstrom.

An even sharper-eyed observer would notice that the trolls are not fighting to kill - they seem to be going to some effort to bring the ogres down with a minimum of force. It seems almost merciful, were mercy not such a foreign concept to trollkind.

The sharpest-eyed observer would notice that the trolls have gills.

Once the ogres have been dispatched, even the most casual observer would note that the next arrival in the ruins is no troll or ogre. The ophidian features that acknowledge the trolls with a nod are distinctly those of a female naga - and unusually, the trolls bow deeply in obeisance to the witch of the seas as she raises her hands and begins to chant in Nazja. Slowly, a pearlescent white mist forms above her hands and begins to flow over her, over the trolls, over the ruins, and over the horde of murlocs, naga, and trolls making their way into the protection of the ancient walls - and then the observer would see no more.

---

The defeat of the ogre squatters _was_, in fact, noted by a keen-eyed observer - a Darkspear scout and shadow hunter in his own right. Making his way away from the ruins, he waits until he is well clear before pulling a small metal box from a pouch on his belt and twiddles a knob with an intense frown of concentration. He is rewarded by a faint crackle from a metal grille on the box, into which he speaks, recounting the events he had just seen.

Nor is he alone. A dozen Horde shadow hunters have been following the naga war party as it makes its way inland, marching at a slow but steady pace toward a Skullsplitter encampment deep in the heart of the jungle, staying out of sight of the naga's own troll scouts, and reporting on their movements and their order of battle.

The battle group numbers about a dozen naga, perhaps a hundred murlocs, and threescore war trolls, all of which bear the gills that mark them as tide-touched; after the Mizjah encounter, another dozen ogres have joined the party.

The war party moves slowly, their pace set by the naga which are not ideally suited to travel on land - though they find travel in the thick undergrowth of the jungle little more difficult than they would any other terrain not submerged beneath the waves. They follow the course of the rivers as much as they are able, for the sake of the murloc minions, and they prefer to make camp in the shadows of ancient troll ruins, preferring abandoned or lightly occupied sites - the latter serving to expand the size of the invasion force.

Armed with this information, the advance team from Grom'gol explores the area where their zeppelin has touched down, and finds the ideal campsite for the naga - a large and rambling troll ruin that was once part of Zul'Mamwe, but has been abandoned by the latter-day Skullsplitters. A minor stream flows past the ruins, a tributary of the great Naz'feriti River, just enough to provide drinking water for the naga invaders, and enough for their murlocs to bathe in.

The mages of Grom'gol, led by Ezra Pyreborn, make their own camp some distance away from the ruin, and begin the ritual to open a portal to the orcish base camp. The main ambush force then begins to spread out amongst the ruins of Zul'Mamwe, preparing a warm welcome for the children of Dagun.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All right. Now! There are things to be done yet before the guests of honor arrive. Anything y'all want to contribute to the party preparations?"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Remote detination land mines? :D"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Nerai, for example, with her trademark goblin fireworks? Saeren, with setting up sniper nests and kill zones?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Yup. And I have a suggestion on that point, if you'd care to hear it."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Sure. Always listen to the DM."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm going to put up a renewed Shade charsheet in a sec here, too, GM."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Well, the reason the naga are using troll ruins as campsites is for cover. They are painfully aware that they are chasiing an enemy that can shoot arrows that turn them into lamia."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "And this means that, if battle occurs, they will be hiding behind ruin walls."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Can you guess where I'm going with this?"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "One assumes there are likely rune walls?"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "I think I can conver this in a couple of poses."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Go for it. Log is open."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Nice :)"

> (OOC) Nerai will take a bit to compose.

> (OOC) Saeren will sneak in some poses too, and reference the expectation of the hell that Nerai is going to let loose.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "GM, can Shade's permeation ability work here? It's 'woodlands', and I have the xp to blow to expand it if need be."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Shade should be able to do this, yes. We can work out the details after."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Awesome."

Nerai looks over the map, and consults with Ezra for a short time, and an likely confrontation point is found. Given the rate and path the Naga are traveling, Nerai and Ezra agree to some runes that will probably figure prominently in the fight. Nerai gathers up a small crew of Goblins to help, negotiating some cover in case things get bad.

On site, Nerai directs efforts to hide explosives in most of the runes, some strategic drilling and planting of charges to bring down walls, and level various obstructions. Saeren has indicated some likely sniper nests, and ruins that would block the line of site have been identified and given priority. The task doesn't take long, of course what Goblin doesn't have a few explosives around for sale, and the triggers are all brought back to base camp.

A huge part of the art of the sniper is position. For Saeren, knowing where her enemy will be is an advantage of incredible proportions. Armed with this, she is able to make excellent use of Shade's blinding speed, moving through the jungle to discover the most favorable positions. Communicating with her fellow archers and gaining a considerable amount of respect in the process, she lays a web of slaughter points. The enemy no doubt fears what she can do. They will learn to fear what her allies can do.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "One more.."

Saeren's positions are laid out in such a way that two thirds of the archers supporting her will be opposite the area that will be most exposed after the explosions. Nerai's work is orchestrated to do this and at the same time, create a natural escape route that is wide enough to entice the enemy to retreat with good order. Along that path, the bulk of the archer force waits, led by a captain who knows exactly when to open fire to throw the entire force into complete chaos.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Essentially I want to give them a seemingly wonderful escape route that is really a death trap in the making."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "The last steps I'd want to have are Ezra and the rest of Grom'gol helping to conceal these devious preparations. If Bill is busy with family stuff right now, I'll be borrowing Ezra for this bit."

All these preparations will be for naught if they are discovered too soon. Fortunately, the ambush force includes many skilled in the arts of illusion and deception, chief among them the master illusionist Ezra L. Pyreborn. Sniper nests, already well hidden from prying eyes, are further cloaked with a subtle veil to hide them still further; explosive rigs appear as chunks of fallen stone; and troll deadfalls, already masterfully carpeted with fallen leaves, are reinforced just enough to carry the weight of small rocks that the naga's pet trolls might use to detect them.

Nor does the ambush rely solely on Ezra's own skills. Orcish mages lend their own talents and energy, and Darkspear shadow hunters have their own talents for concealing an ambush - including one individual whose pact with the jungle spirits allows him to summon vegetation to overgrow the Zul'Mamwe ruins, providing physical concealment to supplement the mystical variety.

One last touch: a complex and subtle illusion cast on a high stony ridge adjacent to the ruins, drawing upon the resources of the ambush's entire magical corps. Before the eyes of the onlookers, half of the ridge vanishes, to be replaced by a sheer cliff face, with authentic-looking jungle vegetation at its base. To those who do not know the illusion is there, it will seem like a precipice too steep to safely leap from, and the naga will be lulled into relying on its protection.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I have to afk a few minutes.."

The preparations are complete. A seemingly ordinary troll ruin has become a death trap, tailored to draw the naga into its embrace unsuspecting, until just the right moment. There is little for the ambushers to do now but take their positions... and wait.

---

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "It's a good time to take a brief break. I still hvae some things I want to work out in my head."

> (OOC) Kaliera has connected.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Catch up on logs, s'il vous plait :)"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "...how do you do that again? Still not up to your somewhat idiosyncratic stuff"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "viewlog"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "OK, caught up."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "That was quick :) Anything you see Kaliera contributing to the ambush prep?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "May not be necessary. She could well be more useful in the actual ambush."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Actually, yes. She's going to assist by casting Sense Observation on the most logical entry point, so that we know when they can see it."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "...and when their scouts arrive."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Pose it in, and I'll swap it as appropriate"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Actually, no. I think that particular spell, given its duration, would be best cast closer to the moment. Let me lead up"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "ah, OK, then"

The Darkspear scouts report in, as night begins to fall. The naga are on the move and looking for a campsite for the night. Ambushers draw their cloaks of leaves or illusion over themselves, and keen eyes watch for the first of the naga's own scouts.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Go for it."

Kaliera closes her eyes and whispers a soft prayer to the Light. There's a slight shimmer near the entrance to the ruins closest to the scouts, and then it's gone - at least, to those whose eyes only see the physical world. "When they come in sight of the entrance," Kaliera says softly, "I will notify the ambushers." She's given talismans to the squad leaders, so she can inform them of this fact. There will be plenty of warning of the approach of the enemy...

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "What's your skill with Sense Observation, Kaliera?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "16"

And thus Kaliera discovers something that the Darkspear scouts had not. Before the naga's scouts are sent to explore, the naga themselves scry upon the terrain ahead of them. The Light informs Kaliera that magical eyes are now upon the ruins of Zul'Mamwe, moving over the jungle... and now lingering on the site for long moments. The inference is obvious: the naga have found their campsite.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sorry, back ><"

"They have scryed on the site," says Kaliera, very softly, to the people around here.

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "...that should be 'Kaliera says', sorry"

Minutes later, Saeren's keen eyes discern movement along the jungle canopy. The Dagun-enthralled Bloodscalps are coming. Some lope along the ground, but others move amongst the trees of Stranglethorn, leaping from branch to branch and even swinging upon vines.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Line 77 updated accordingly. And good timing, Saeren :)"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "It's almost time to begin the operation."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, " 'Let's go practice medicine.'"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Are you sure this will work?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "I have no idea!"

The enemy, however, is not watching closely yet. They move right past Saeren and her advance scouts without even blinking; one of them even alights on her own tree, three branches up. It is only when they are within sight of the ruins themselves that they fan out, searching each tree exhaustively.

The naga are keenly aware that their enemy has the ability to turn their kind with an arrow, and they are careful to ensure that no such archers are within bowshot of the Zul'Mamwe ruins. Too bad for them, then, that Saeren and her squadron are poised instead over the naga's escape route.

Satisfied that the trees are clear, the trolls move into the ruins themselves, similarly searching for signs of an ambush. Again, though, they are hampered by misapprehension. The Bloodscalp are most adept at detecting signs of ambushes laid by their own kind; they are expecting the voodoo of troll witch doctors, not the sophisticated arcane prowess of Ezra and his allies. The traps and pitfalls go unnoticed, and the naga force moves in.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "GM, just as a matter of warning, I plan on using Quick Shooting Rules (MA, pg 119), which means my shots are at -1, and I can fire every second."

As the war trolls take up positions behind the ruins' walls, preparing themselves for the watches, the naga witch who commands the expedition begins once more to summon the magical mist that they have used to defend their hiding place. Every wilderness adventurer knows the spell, and knows better than to attack anything protected by such magic, for it confuses and blinds anyone who was not present when the spell was cast.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "So noted. :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Now... is everyone who is present, ready to begin?"

Kaliera takes a moment to release the energy she's using to maintain the detection spell - no longer needed, after all - and instead considers images of flames.

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Ready."

> (OOC) Nerai is fine for now, will need a break at an undisclosed time later.

However, the mystical mist, being such a well-known spell, is just as easily dispelled. Kragg, the orcish commander, peeks out from his leafy cover at the top of the ridge, and waits for the opportune moment.

"Kaliera?" he whispers. "Do you know why I dislike the draenei so much?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "More, unless you'd like to give a longer answer."

Kaliera says, "No, Commander, I do not.""

"Back on Draenor," says the orc, "we... well, I needn't tell you what my people did, after we drank the demon blood. But I was leading an army against one of the cities on the outskirts of the Temple of Karabor. We thought it deserted. We were wrong. Your people, the draenei, had prepared an ambush. I went in with a hundred orcs... I came out with less than ten.

"I felt foolish, for having been fooled so easily," continues Kragg. "And I covered for it, by telling myself that the draenei were cowards, fighting without honor." He snorts, shaking his head. "And that's what I've been telling myself ever since. Even after I came to realize that our own war against you was without honor."

He hangs his head. "And now, I prepare to do just what your kinsmen did. And for the same reason - for the sake of survival, my survival and the survival of those I care about." He looks Kaliera in the eye. "Can you forgive me, draenei? Not just for the atrocities on Draenor... but for the contempt I showed you, which you did not deserve?"

Kaliera says, "I heard of that incident. It was considered one of the few victories, and we mourned the losses on both sides. Many of us remember the days before those wars, when our people lived in peace together on Draenor." She pauses. "I lost a member of my clan, my mother's brother, in that battle. And yet, Valen has told us to not blame the orc people, but those who betrayed them.. both demon and orc."

Kaliera places a hand on his shoulder. "I forgive you for the slight against me, and honor you for recognizing your honor and strength to admit what you just have.

Kaliera says, "For the atrocities on Draenor... I think your path towards honor will bring you what you most lack, the forgiveness of yourself."

Kragg places his hand over Kaliera's. "Thank you." He nods to Ezra. "Begin the ambush. Lift the enemy's fog."

> (OOC) Sookie cast Dispel Magic desu

Kaliera then smiles. "Let us fight together, and show them that those of Draenor fight with strength and honor. Lok'tar... my friend."

> (OOC) Nerai paints one of Sookie's eyes red.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Any poses for Dispel Magic/Counterspell, or shall I just get it started?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "just get it started"

The white mist shreds in an instant before Ezra's gesture, revealing an army of naga, murlocs, trolls, and ogres. They are caught off guard only for a moment, before the naga commander takes cover deep in the ruins, and begins barking orders. Troll headhunters position themselves at the ruins' entrances, axes at the ready, and murlocs fan out in all directions.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "This is primarily not going to be rolled. I will call for specific rolls for specific things, but for the most part, I want you to begin taking advantage of your preparations."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "So for example, this seems like the right moment to blow the charges."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Nerai, roll Explosives, then pose accordingly. On a failure, pose it mostly working, but with some thematically interesting mishap."

> (OOC) Nerai rolls 3d6 for 11 (6 2 3)

> (OOC) Nerai looks up .

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Succeeding by 3."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Ya"

The explosives are triggered, flits of little charges explode in the cracks and strategic crags that the charges were placed. Instead of lots of pyrotechnics and flash, instead rocks are cracked and begin to fall. An entire wall on the east end of the ruin begins to lean, slowly, then faster and faster until it hits the ground, being able to feel it all around. Many once-concealed trolls and naga now have a very nice view of doom.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Let me know when you are done and I should pick it up again."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "That's all I got unless there's more I should put in."

The cries of trolls and murlocs crushed by rubble echo through the evening air. The central building, which the naga witch had used for shelter, begins to cave in around her, only to be blown apart by her own magic. But before she can gather her wits, Kragg rises from his concealment. "LOK'TAR OGAR!" he roars. "FOR THE HORDE!" reply his men, and the Horde rushes down the invisible escarpment, the rock materializing under their feet as their charge puts the children of Dagun into disarray.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All right. We're going to have a few poses of close-quarters fighting amongst the rubble. Who wants to contribute? Sookie would be good for this, as would Kaliera and Eecee. Saeren, I'm saving for covering the retreat."

Kaliera casts a spell quickly, then follows behind the orcs, with the others, preparing for a flame jet, or if need be a fireball.. and always, always, ready to heal.

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "the spell is shield (magic 167, 4 energy in it for a DB of 2)."

> (OOC) Sookie will crush naga relentlessly sure

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Try to leave a few alive for me to turn :D"

Sookie is not a front-line fighter by nature. While the noisy orcs are going about their own business, she manages to dart through cover and take up a well-hidden position. From there, she makes use of the tools Nerai has so thoughtfully provided: the rocky rubble of the trolls' ruined walls. Chunks of stone that are head-sized or larger are hurled, one after another, at the aquatic defenders - and then Sookie is off again, finding another spot from which to bombard the naga, in case her original spot is identified.

Nerai charges forward in Eecee, Her shield at the ready. She pushes her shield in front of her. Eecee charges full steam ahead into a gap created by the explosives, and she pushes her shield into the hapless occupant, a pair of trolls who are pushed forward several yards from the charge. She waves her heavy sword at her side, squaring up to face the invaders.

The naga calls out orders in her own tongue, trying to rally her scattered force into a defensive line. But not all of them. One dozen trolls and a score of murlocs retreat to the northeast, with the ogres making a path for them through the Horde warriors, then remaining behind to cover their escape.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "That, Saeren, is your cue. Save some of your tricks for the general retreat, though."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sorry, back now :)"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "oh, the bunch heading out to the NE are Saeren's targets? OK."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "They're heading on the retreat path, yes."

Saeren and her fellow archers let out a horrible shout, their voices roaring over the din of combat just before the arrows start to come down. In a succession so rapid that even the most seasoned of the horde's snipers are stunned, Saeren's darts rain down. Her first target: the ogres. Two at a time, blast after blast, the best of the Naga's slaves are unchained from their bonds. For some, this leads to a run to freedom without helping their masters, for others, this leads to instant retribution, as they turn upon their leash-holders without mercy. All around the battle more arrows come down, and mixed in the volley are the glittering shots of the War Wave, blessed with the purifying power of the Titans.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm sure the ogres are more than happy to repay the naga for this one. :)"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I think that's enough for the moment?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "It is, but be prepared for more."

And as the ogres turn on the natives of the sea, Saeren can see the face of the naga queen as she realizes, to her horror, that her entire mission was a trap - that it was not disorganized and leaderless jungle trolls that had beset them on the Haunted Isle, but the organized might of the Horde.

But she does not falter easily. She hollers more orders; the soldiers - at least the ones she still commands - stoop to gather what cover they can. Her male naga bodyguards raise enormous shields to protect herself and her fellow witches. And the entire war party charges into the jungle toward Saeren and her archers, with a rear guard fighting to protect their flanks from the orcish warriors.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "My turn? :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Yep."

> (OOC) Sookie will be grappling shields when they come into range :D

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Can I put that into my pose, Sookie?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "sure, assumin GM doesn't negate it"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "We good, GM? :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Go for it."

And that is exactly what Saeren has been waiting for. There's another roar of challenge from the archers, and every exposed bit of Naga flesh feels their bite. As they rush closer, the last key of the plan slides into place. Suddenly powerful Naga warriors feel their shields ripped away, and moments later the shots of the War Wave find them. Some do not turn immediately, but those that do grapple the naga warriors at their side, giving Saeren and her archers still more targets. Any that are not turned find themselves reduced to scaled pin cushions in moments. In the chaos, Saeren has her biggest opportunity, and takes aim at the witch. Again and again she fires her darts at this most dangerous enemy, giving her the choice not once, but many times to flee from her slavery and risk freedom once more.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "There we go n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I gotta do an RL afk for about 10 or 15, though :( I Hope that gets things moving :)"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "I'll be RL for about 20 here, sorry... "

> (OOC) Sookie keeps the home fires burning

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Sounds good. I'll keep it going with Bill's help."

The naga looks around her in dismay as two of her doughtiest warriors - and one of her cadre of sirens - shed their scales before her very eyes, turning on their companions.

The first of Saeren's shots fly wide, and the witch hisses in triumph, sneering at the jungle canopy where her unseen enemy lurks - then screams as the siren-turned-lamia makes a gesture. There is a brief flash around her, and the lamia yells, "The shield is down! FIRE, my savior!"

Before the naga queen can raise her magical wards again, two watery arrows find her cold-blooded flesh. The shafts dissolve into water and flow down her shoulder, and she cries out, thrashing - and her scales fly off in all directions, leaving pink flesh beneath. She looks around at the rest of the naga and grins - and with a gesture, sends her former allies flying.

"SURRENDER!" shouts Ezra, voice enhanced with magic, now taking his place in the battle. He strides forward, his cane guiding his path through fallen bodies and crumbled masonry. "Surrender now, slaves of Dagun!"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I'm kind of in a pickle here. Typically, 'slaves of Dagun' do not surrender. n.n"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "true. but I still have to ask."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "their leader is also now batting for the other team, if I read this log right"

The newest member of Azeroth's newest race shakes her head. "No use!" she calls to Ezra. "The slaves of Dagun do not surrender! They must be subdued - or slain!" Her honor guard takes up positions to defend her, with Eecee rolling up to help replace the naga who did not turn.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Does anyone have anything more, or shall we move on to the aftermath?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "one more thing."

"Kill only those you cannot ssubdue, then," orders Ezra. "Thiss is important, yess."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Back"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I have something I want to do.."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm going for theatrics here n.n"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Go for it. :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "My next pose, btw, was to have the new lamia order everyone to focus on giving you clear shots :)"

> (OOC) Nerai returns, catches up.

Saeren leaps down from the treetop, seeing the enemy has gathered for one last desperate act of vengeance. They turn with their might upon their former mistress, and put Eecee and the newly-turned Lamia to a harsh test. On this battlefield, however, there is nothing so fast as the nightsaber Shade. Moving at speeds that few of even its swift kind can come close to, the great cat draws Saeren close in short measure, and all the while the War Wave forces the enemy to make their choices. Not just once, but again and again they face a decision that haunts the mind. To cling to death and despair, or risk something new without certainty. But the greatest among the enemy will not be dissuaded, and even as his trident badly wounds one of the Lamia Shade finds him, fangs shattering his arm just before the War Wave cleaves his head cleanly from his body, the weapon turning at the very last moment into a terrible two-handed axe.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "There, going for excessive drama."

"Freed slaves, hear me!" calls the lamia queen, her own voice amplified just as Ezra's had been. "Take all prisoners! Focus on giving Saeren a clear shot!" The confusion of battle gives way to a new order - each free member of each race fights the Tide-Touched of their own kind, not to kill, but merely to grapple them out of cover and into Saeren's path, where the War Wave can grant them freedom.

Though not all naga will voluntarily give up Dagon's curse, nearly all of the Tide-Touched are freed with a single stroke. And bereft of leadership, the remaining Tide-Touched do not let up the struggle - but nor can they long prevail against the Horde, or the power of the Titans.

> (OOC) Saeren slips in a last pose here..

> (OOC) Kaliera slips in something as well.

Kaliera casts spells to put some of the ones that may be harder to reach into a slumber... where they can be brought to Saeren, or a grail.

Tirelessly Saeren goes to work, born by Shade there are few enemies that can evade her long, and those that think they have escaped into the jungles find only the cunning traps of trolls and no escape. With the magic of Kaliera and the raw power of Sookie and the physical prowess of the Horde, all those that remain are put to the test until there can be only one choice.

As the last of the melee comes to a halt, Ezra surveys the survivors. "Who here now sspeaks for Dagun? Sstep forward," he shouts.

No one moves. Except for one male naga, lying on a shattered slab and surrounded by swords and axes, who hesitantly waves a hand in acknowledgement, being very careful not to make any sudden movements.

"You." Ezra turns, pointing with the tip of his cane. "Ansswer me one quesstion. Dagun proposess to drown thiss world with the sseass. Very well. What of the qiraji of C'thun? What of the minionss of the other Old Godss?"

"What of them?" replies the naga, shrugging and wincing. "Let them find their own place, if they awaken."

"Very well." Ezra says no more of that. Instead: "And iss it your will that Dagun drown the world? You can live in peace, or on land, but not both, it sseems. You reject the transsformation of the lamia. Are you truly sslaves to Dagun's will, or iss there anything you yoursself wish?"

"Our kind once ruled the world," replies the naga. "As you surely know by now. We _will_ rule it again. You may have defeated us here, but Azshara will be Queen of all that live, and there is nothing you can do about it."

"We can win againsst your military force with a ssimple ruse," points out Ezra. "We can convert a fraction of your forcess into lamia with a ssimple weapon and a formula. We have undone the power of your chalice and created the grail, yess." The wizard hobbles close and leans in. "As rulerss of the world, I musst say.. you're rather unfit. We will succeed you."

The naga snorts, and shrugs. "We will see. Or rather, _you_ will see."

Ezra turns away. "They are yourss, Kragg. I have everything I wissh to know."

"He has had his chance," says the lamia queen, slithering forward. "And there is nothing he can tell you that I cannot. I beg of you, grant him an honorable death. He has fought well for what he believes in; he deserves nothing less."

"I agree," says Kragg, stepping forward and drawing his bow. "Lok'tar ogar, friend." The last naga of the invasion force looks Kragg in the eye and does not blink, meeting his death with his eyes open.

> (OOC) Kaliera has an action to take now that the battle is over.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Go for it."

Kaliera takes a deep breath, steading herself and trying to block out the gore-smell of the battlefield. She reaches into her pouch, pulling out a satchel she slings over her other shoulder: filled with lesser alchemical preparations to cleanse wounds and slow bleeding and numb the worst of the pain, along with numerous bandages and other supplies for the nonmagical healing of wounds. It also holds a book with a number of prayers to speed the souls of the deceased to their rest.

> (OOC) Sookie afk briefly here

> (OOC) Saeren poses

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Kaliera: ecumenical funeral services aren't really in vogue in Azeroth. The lamia won't mind and the ogres won't care, but the murlocs prefer to bury their dead at sea, and the trolls don't bury their dead at all, except eight hours later if you follow me."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Well, yes, but there's also orcs who probably died. And it's not really 'ecumenical' it's more like 'that one doesn't quite fit the situation, let's use a different one'. You don't want to use the prayer for 'died of old age' for someone who died in honorable combat."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "True enough. And yeah, the orcs and Darkspears will appreciate your effort."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "On that note, once Saeren's done, there is the question of what the trolls will /do/. But more on that after."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "and most of what she's doing is the bandaging and healing for the injured, she's going to wait on Kragg for the dead, other than make sure they are in fact dead and not mostly-dead."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "I was just stating what the book was. :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Fair enough."

Saeren steps away from where the last enemy fell to check on the Lamia and her companions. The elf shares a smile with Kaliera, as well as a comforting touch of her shoulder, "For now, the worst is over. Yet much work remains for us." She herself has only a little skill in treating the wounded, but on this day that seems to put her in some demand for all the lesser wounds. Along the way she finds herself face to face with the former Naga witch. While the Lamia holds herself with resolve and grace (and perhaps a bit of uncertainty as to what to feel), Saeren embraces her warmly and says, "Welcome to your new family. I must say, when your scales were shed was one of the happiest moments I can remember."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Kaliera is head doctor, I'm basically a weak version of first aid. I can also do mobile pharmacy with Shade. If he can get the scent and it grows here, we'll find it :D"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "At 58 miles per hour :D"

The surviving trolls may be free of the chalice's curse, but this does not mean they are friends. They have enough sense to know when they are badly outnumbered, though, and they carry themselves like prisoners of war - which is, in itself, a concept foreign to trolls.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm sure the other trolls merely prison tomorrow's lunch menu. n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Merely=consider"

But there _is_ a path open to them. Ezra tells them the story of Zen'jal, and advises them to join their fellow trolls in his rebellion against the Tide-Touched and the witch doctors who control them. Faced with the choice between this and death at the hands of the Horde, they eagerly accept, taking their fallen comrades with them - it is a long way back to the coastline, after all, and they will need provisions.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "To which I can only say 'ew'"

The murlocs, for their part, remain faithful to the lamia, and the ogres are appropriately grateful to Saeren. The survivors of the battle gather round, for there is much that Selana the lamia commander has to tell.

The naga had come to the Haunted Isle for the same reason they came to Tides' Hollow and Purgation Isle: to capture a site of elemental power and consecrate it to Dagun, then use the chalices they made there to conquer the land-dwellers. If any of the naga knew that the Altar of Naias possessed anything more than favorable geomancy, Selana knows nothing of it. "And I'm pretty sure I would have known," she adds.

Their plan for Northern Stranglethorn followed the same lines it had in other places: use their foothold to conquer the weakest of the nearby land-dwellers, then use that force as leverage against the next, until the whole land belonged to Dagun.

> (OOC) Sookie will try to debrief em on conditions around the island itself, leadership, weak spots, etc.

"Our primary weakness on the Isle, as far as I know," says Selana, "is the fact that our construction is incomplete. Only the central temple has a complete roof, and the rest of the temple complex ranges from four walls to merely a pile of cut stone."

Up until a few weeks ago, the primary contingency plan in the event of Grom'gol moving in force was to capture and enslave the Bilgewater, sail away, and return at a later date with a larger force. This plan changed when they realized that even the incomplete temple to Dagun had enough potency to begin manufacturing chalices.

"All we can do iss to resstrict the shipment of sstone," concludes Ezra quietly. "Then sshell the temple using the goblinss."

"That stands a good chance of working," says Selana. "We have been attempting to waylay the goblins' resupply vessels, with some success, and we had estimated that they would be forced to retreat within the month. If you can reinforce them, though, there will be little my sisters can do to break the siege."

Ezra looks actually mournful - not simply necrotic, but regretful. "There will be much desstruction. I am.. ssorry. I could not find a better way."

Selana rubs her chin. "There is more. If my sisters realize that the siege is unbreakable, they will abandon the Haunted Isle entirely. But instead of retreating, they will move inland. The corruption of the Bloodscalp has gone farther than you might have guessed; we had almost reached an agreement with Gan'zulah of the Bloodscalp when I left. By this time, they may well be ready to put the entire population of Zul'Kunda to the chalice."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Zul'Kunda is the biggest population center of the Bloodscalp. If they fell, that means pretty much all of the trolls between the river and the ocean."

The wizard rubs his hands together. "That other troll ssaid something.... yesss. I musst find out more from the Darksspear. Thiss may work to our advantage yet."

Kaliera returns now, outer robe changed and slightly damp, looking tired but bearing a platter of food, followed by a young orc carrying a tray with mugs and beer - and water. "I thought you might need some refreshment." She formally thanks the orc for his help, then sits.

Selana looks intrigued. "I must say, you have impressed my sisters with your resourcefulness, Ezra Pyreborn. We weren't able to get any message to the Haunted Isle other than that we had been ambushed, but if they knew _you_ were moving against them..."

In a blast of sand, Ezra finds himself in living form again. Taking a slice of jungle stalker from the tray, he pops it into his living mouth and begins chewing. "I'm full of surprises," he remarks with a smirk.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone have anything else? It seems to me that further plotting should be left for another time..."

> (OOC) Sookie has a bit more.

> (OOC) Sookie checks saeren for life

> (OOC) Saeren lives

After a bit of food, Ezra draws Saeren aside. He gestures over in the distance, where Sookie is playing a feral form of hide-and-seek with Shade. "It seems that this creature has found a reliable older sister," he remarks. "You have done well."

Saeren raises an eyebrow and laughs softly, "I suppose she has, at that. But I don't know that I'm the best older sister one might have. Tell me, am I wrong to confuse her with the strange lessons of life as a free being?"

"Only she can answer that, I think," muses Ezra. He then gestures in the direction of Kaliera, preparing food, then to Nerai. "the draenei has shown strength and a desire for peace, a noble heart which characterized their people when we met them previously. Of Nerai I need say nothing; her actions have spoken volumes to her credit." He lets out a sigh. "The cost of these victories is wearing on me. A few more such successes and my soul will be too weary of war to continue. I'm afraid I will need to lean on you all more than before."

"You are my best friend, Ezra," replies Saeren. "I will see this through to the end. It seems right to do this. To save those who would be saved, and as for the others, they must be stopped."

Kaliera taps a small jar carefully. "Darnassian kimchi. Very spicy. Be careful."

"I must go soon to speak to the Bronze Dragonflight." Ezra takes a breath; still in his living form, it's an act he's unaccustomed to. "I must confront the dragonflights. They have power that we need, power which can end this war more quickly. I have left you all behind before; it will be some time before I do so again. But if they refuse me, I may not survive to return."

Saeren looks to Kaliera and smiles. To Ezra she says, "They will not refuse you. You represent something that the future always needs more of: redemption. I do not know if they will grant us their aid swiftly. Regardless, we will do what must be done. And look at what we have achieved! Dagun's threat has given us a chance to grow closer that would have never happened had no such danger existed."

Ezra thinks a moment. "I suppose. Well... I can't die yet. I've still to have words with Fandral Staghelm over his duties as a father." He grins. "Come. Let us try this Darnassian dish, and see if we are to survive _it_."
