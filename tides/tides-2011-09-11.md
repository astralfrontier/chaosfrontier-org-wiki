It's time! As far as the naga know, their expeditionary force just disappeared off the face of the world, with no better intelligence than before on what's coming next. Now is the time to outmaneuver and outflank.

The naga objective is to build a temple on the haunted island to focus its geomantic energies into a workable chalice factory. For this to succeed, they need many things. Cut and uncut stone (the island has only sand and trees); treated water infused with Dagun's energy (sand and trees); and various ingredients of arcane or occult significance (of which neither sand nor trees qualify). To bring these things to shore, they have been transporting them from other sites via threshadon.

The goblins of the Bilgewater Cartel have up until now been able to half-heartedly harry these shipments, by lobbing cannonfire at the beach where the supplies are brought to shore. In response, the naga have been sending their murloc minions and some of their unluckier warriors out to the goblin fleet and harrassing them in turn. Today this is coming to an end.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "more inc"

> (OOC) Nerai has connected.

> (OOC) Nerai idles for sum food, bu tis here

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Yay, it's Brendan :)"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "I would try to disbelieve, but then bad things might happen."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I'll cover the ship defense, hopefully Brendan can cover the land offense."

Why haven't the goblin ships just been sunk by the murlocs? Ezra believes that it's because the naga want to capture them - probably to use in a later assault against Stormwind. Undersea creatures like naga have no development in areas like cannon, which are ineffective underwater but highly useful against fortified port towns. And so the first order of business is to get some troops over to the ships, before the naga find them too costly to want to save.

The orcs of Grom'gol are lined up. Their ordering is timed and rehearsed. The commander of the cartel ships, Boltloose, is informed of the plan and begins to arrange his ships accordingly. Then, at the appointed time: "Gate open!"

The combined might of Grom'gol's mystics can only hold a teleportation portal open for a minute. But almost a hundred and fifty hardened warriors can make it through in that time, backpacks bulging with provisions. And once the spellcasters replenish their power, more can be sent through.

"Hut! Hut! Hut!" barks Kragg, marking off time with a voice as loud as thunder. Grom'gol's finest hustle through, meeting the goblins on the other side. They swarm over the netting and ropes of the goblin ships, swinging or brachiating from one to another, spreading themselves over the cartel's vessels.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "more when ready"

> (OOC) Sookie has put everyone to sleep-ne

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Iie."

> (OOC) Sookie will have to fix this with the next bit-ne.

Kaliera has her healer-satchel over a shoulder, her staff in hand, and is ready for what comes next. She hopes.

"We're going aboard the airship!" announces Ezra, still fresh - he's used most of his magical energies for the gate ceremony, but he has more to spare. The shamans and witch doctors of Grom'gol get aboard as well, along with two summoned elementals. These creatures have been brought into a bargain with the port town: aid from the stormfather spirits in exchange for regular veneration on the island. But since that was the plan anyway, it seemed like a good deal all around.

The goblin zeppelin takes off, with the adventurers aboard. Kragg and Nimboya join them, along with a crew of goblins. As they move, the elementals begin chanting, joined by the shamans, and a thick cloud begins to spin itself around the craft. "Dis one cost us mebbe a year o' service," estimates one of the trolls. "But it be worth it ta see da look on dem naga faces."

Indeed, Kaliera says. She is also staying close to the center of the zeppelin and trying not to look over the side too much."

A call comes over the radio. Kagarn, relaying information from Boltloose and acting as healer aboard the cartel flagship, announces what everyone knew was coming: another shipment. But bad news comes with it. "There are far more murlocs and naga than anticipated, unfortunately. Captain Boltloose is commencing a singularly questionable operation, perhaps designed to--" Ezra cuts him off, yelling into the radio. "Jusst tell him we're coming."

> (OOC) Nerai rejoins and reads

"Big Red Button is primed and standin' by on your orders!" reports the goblin captain. But perhaps the idea that he'd wait for confirmation is too much to ask. "Pushin' the Big Red Button!" he yells, and the emergency rockets aboard the zeppelin engage. A burst of speed sends everyone sprawling on deck as the craft streaks toward the cartel fleet.

Kragg tosses Saeren a pair of oversized arrows, with trailing ropes attached. They'll be heavy and hard to shoot. He gestures down at the cartel's flagship as the zeppelin draws near. "Aim above the waterline. We've no time to land properly!" he yells over the roar of the rockets.

Kaliera closes her eyes and prays. A lot. And wishes she'd taken the advice to study that levitation spell.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "handin posing over to Saeren"

Saeren takes the arrows, weighing them for a moment in her hands and setting them to the string of the War Wave. The distance she measures in her mind, the wind draws out her hair behind her, and with this she makes her adjustments. Whether the two are shot as one or not only the keenest eyes might tell, so fast is her work, and both strike true and hold fast, far enough above the water to allow for what follows..

> (OOC) Saeren leads the charge, here.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Oh, and are there naga/murlocs near at hand?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "oh yes."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'd be rather pleased if that were the case."

No sooner do the strands draw taut then Saeren flies down the length of one, her feet somehow untroubled by such an uncertain perch. Even as she comes the air is full of the words of her bow, which bring death and terror to the enemies below. Every second it sings more clearly, and her bottomless quarrel strives to empty itself into every foe that does not flee at the sight of her coming.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "not done :)"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "open pose. those who want to hit the deck can do so via the tethers Saeren just shot. Those who want to stay up can as well"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "k, waitin on that then :)"

Behind Saeren comes a glut of orc warriors, fearless and eager for battle. Some of these have the footing of the night elf, while others use the power of their hands alone to crash towards the boat below. At the last moment with a great kick the first of these lands on the deck at Saeren's side and with a great sweep of a wicked axe clears a space for the archer to work in, leaving two murlocs sprawling, headless before he wades deeper into the melee.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Oh, and open for all :)"

> (OOC) Kaliera has reconnected.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Stepping in."

Ezra follows the others down the line, using the hook of his cane to ride the line. His landing is cushioned by the goblin ship's netting, and he immediately goes to work: illusions, smoke and trickery to confuse the naga and murlocs about who is who and what is where.

As the attackers from Grom'gol wade into battle, a lookout calls out "War turtle!", followed a moment later by a bright bolt of fire flashing through the air and igniting a sail. A pagoda-shaped howdah emerges from the sea on the back of a giant turtle, accompanied by a hail of crossbow bolts and further fireballs. Whatever this shipment was, it was so important to the naga that one of their witches had come to press the attack - or else, this was to have been their serious attempt to capture a goblin vessel.

Kaliera takes a deep breath, using her staff to slide down the line. When she lands, she turns to face the pagoda, trying to see the priestess, taking a deep breath in as she begins to bring her power to bear. Her eyes already glow a sky-blue, as she puts all the battle out of her mind, concentrating on focusing the power of the Light, shaping it to her needs.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "In case it wasn't obvious, the pagoda serves as cover for the naga; both their crossbow archers and their mage are using Pop-up Attacks."

Ezra sees the turtle, and engulfs himself in his sands. What emerges after a few seconds isn't a living man. It's a haughty-looking gray-skinned version of him, but with notably red eyes.. and fangs. As blood from the fallen on deck stream toward his feet, he lets out an unearthly howl and begins charging up fireballs. But these are far stronger than his normal ones, and he seems able to hurl them without weakening in the slightest. His target is the turtle - hardly a hard target to hit.

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Yeh, but why try for something easy?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Kaliera, can you give me an open shot on any target on the turtle?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "If there are naga there, or corrupted, I have something special in mind. But I need a target I can hit ^^"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "What's the pagoda made out of? I never could tell."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Primarily coral, with metal structural members. The coral is unnaturally tough - treat as stone, except lighter. Certainly /not/ invulnerable."

Kaliera focuses the power a bit more, then thrusts her arm forth, a burst of fire coming from it, heading for the turtle.

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Create Fire."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Trying to get it under the edge of the pagoda, or in front, just something to make them need to move."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Your biggest challenge is range."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I think K mentioned getting Throw Spell, which will solve that"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Yes. I do have it"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "In that case, it looks cool, so do it. ^\_^"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I am going to slip in a fast pose :)"

Saeren sees the new challenge and steps close to Kaliera. "If there is anything you might do to drive one of them in sight, or buy me a clear shot in some other way, we may be able to distract them long enough for greater powers to be brought to bear." Like fireballs.

As the fire lands, it spreads into a pool just inside the edge of the pagoda. The magical fire needs no fuel, just the power of the Light, and it covers a good amount of the turtle's top.

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Assuming that the turtle's about 4 hexes radius."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Posing in on that, then, and assuming a head pops up for long enough :)"

Kaliera takes a deep breath, staggering a little, then glances at Saeren. "Is that good enough?"

Saeren does not wait for a response, trusting her friend to find a way. Instead, the elf slips into a trance, her eyes locked on a target. Her bow is drawn fluidly, but slowly, as if it were part of a ceremony from another age. The arrow appears like a spike of blue light, and as Kaliera's words come and the fire takes shape, a Naga is revealed - too long for it. With great exertion the archer puts a portion of her very soul into the shot, so that when it finds its mark it explodes into a million fragments as if it were some work of goblincraft, but every searing fragment carries with it the blessing of the Titans and the very holiness of Elune herself.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Imbue shattershot + Kaliera's fire.. Ezra's fireballs should be able to rain without impediment now."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "basically that whole attack party should be sinking within seconds n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "With shattershot they do get this last chance to turn, as well. So it's all good n.n"

The war turtle ceases its barrage of crossbow bolts and fireballs, and the howdah begins to shake. It's hard to hear over the sounds of battle close at hand, but it seems that a melee has erupted inside the enemy's mobile stronghold, and the turtle swims aimlessly, away from the battle.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Aww, but it was supposed to get fireballed n.n"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "I may have a better idea if I can?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Go for it. :)"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Hehehe. Oh?"

> (OOC) Saeren wants to see Ezra truly cut loose, either way. Somebody has to get blown up. I want to see what he can do ^^

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "If nothing else, he can quickly clear the deck of murlocs and naga! But if Bill can come up with something even cooler, I welcome it."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "on it"

Kaliera casts another spell, sending a swirl of light towards the turtle itself. She makes some strange noises, like terrible howling belches... to the humanoids. To the turtle, it sounds like someone saying, "Come here! We can help you!" Then she says to Ezra, "If the turtle turns this way and you intend to blow things up, aim high on the pagoda."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Beast Speech! And taking control of their vehicle is good for us."

Again Ezra is engulfed in sand. What emerges is a hooded undead figure, flesh burned to cinders by fire. "Leave thiss to mee," he hisses. And gesturing with clawed fingers, he shows why these are not idle words. All around the deck, the fallen murlocs and naga begin to rise again - reanimated as undead. And wordlessly Ezra directs them, needing only to gesture at their fellows for them to understand their grim task.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Okay, that's scary o.O"

> (OOC) Nerai says, "That's awesome. "

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Kaliera's busy taking to a turtle to be mildly horrified."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "...talking."

The sight of the dead rising at first sends Saeren twisting and the War Wave for a moment takes the shape of her wicked axe, and then it is clear whose great magic is at work, and for a moment the night elf stands dumbstruck, watching a small gang of dead murlocs drag down a great Naga warrior and set to work tearing them the enemy apart. Saeren shakes off her terror and turns back to her task, her eyes covering the distance to the hesitating turtle and again she slips into a trance, so that the great distance to her is but a little matter, and she sends darts terrifically far to the aid of allies she has yet to meet.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Note to self: Ezra is not to be trifled with o\_o"

The aquatic zombies, reanimated hurriedly, are fragile enough and easily dispatched... individually. But the forces of Grom'gol have already decimated the forces of Dagun, so they are formidable in numbers. And as the naga fight their fallen comrades, they learn the horrible lesson that the humans of Lordaeron learned long ago, when the Scourge struck their lands: when you face a necromancer, for every ally you lose, another foe is added to the ranks.

With the support of the Covenant of the Grail, the greatest murloc attack to date is dispatched with alarming ease. The remaining naga and murlocs are slain; a small handful surrender where they stand, as soon as their numbers are slight enough that they feel safe from their own allies; and the turtle turns toward Kaliera as ordered. As it draws close, a white flag emerges from one of the arrow slits.

"I believe," Kaliera says, "that we have caused a certain impression."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Pose through handling the surrender as you see fit, then we'll move on to the air assault."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "we have any more? if not, we should queue up Nerai :)"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "eh, this actually seems like a good point to switch :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Sure."

---

Over the boat scene a cloud sails overhead. Nothing out of the ordinary can be seen in the mists, but once can almost make out someone inside of it singing, "I'm just a little black rain cloud." as they drift over to the island. The could provides the perfect cover as the island is approached.

Tut tut, it looks like rain. Well, something is falling from the cloud anyway, and Nerai, on board the ship, manages to keep her goblin crew in check, each holding various devices, most of which can only be described as 'Goblinesque'. The shoreline comes into view, and the various devices begin to be tossed overboard.

The first one goes off on the beach just before it hits the sand. A loud crack is heard as grapeshot is scattered around the beach, finding some curious but otherwise hapless targets among the naga and murlocks gathered there.

The 'could' manages to cut a swath of destruction across the island, various incendiary devices going off around the island, taking out both soft targets, and some weakening battlements and structures present there. As the ship sails away, the chunks of vapor begin to fall off, revealing the zeplin that delivered the aerial bombardment.

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Ist Gut?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "looks good to me"

The naga respond to the bombardment with... sheer chaos. Murlocs race around in a panic, left uncontrolled and leaderless as the naga take shelter in the few temple outbuildings that are even partially complete. A few crossbow archers seem to take aim and fire, but their bolts fall far short, as do the smattering of frostbolts fired from the central temple complex.

As the last wisps of cloud peel away from the zeppelin, the clear sky produces almost no remaining targets. Those naga and murlocs that were not peppered with grapeshot have taken shelter, the magically enhanced stones of the incomplete temple protecting them from further bombardment, but providing no effective means to challenge the intruder in turn.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anything else going on here? Or is it time to send in the clones?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Well, the clone."

> (OOC) Nerai says, "Boba Fett?"

> (OOC) Sookie is gonna go talk to the naga about surrenderin :)

> (OOC) Sookie says, "unless you have more, in which case go do that thing :)"

> (OOC) Nerai is good here.

---

The party is back aboard the zeppelin; transferring passengers is far easier when one isn't in the middle of a battle. Ezra stands at the railing, staring down at the haunted island, and turns back to regard his companions. "My friendss, I realize that in thiss world we cannot ssave all the naga, even thosse who might drink willingly from the grail. We cannot cure the illss of this world. It is.. difficult to ssee ssuch destruction."

> (OOC) Saeren poses, if it is okay :)

> (OOC) Sookie says, "hit it"

Saeren reaches out to set a hand upon Ezra's shoulder. "We have done much, and will do much more for good," she says. "For all that, evil is great and in every story I have heard, it is has left its mark. But still, it is that which resists us that leads true hearts to hope. Even darkness can teach us to love the light all the more."

Kaliera says, quietly but reverently, "Truth in those words." (Did you expect a priestess of the Holy Light to disagree?)

Nerai shrugs, "Distruction and evil are not the same thing." She smiles, "It's more difficult to see friends captured."

The wizard sighs again. "Well. We cannot ssave everyone." He grips the rail firmly, then grins. "But we musst try anyway." And he vaults over the side, falling toward the island below.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "more"

It is a swarm of dust which lands, and a swarm of dust which eventually takes off. But back on the island, a lone figure in a black coat and hat, armed with a strip of white cloth, trudges in the direction of the half-completed naga temple.

This Ezra makes it all the way to the high arches of the temple, waving his white flag of surrender slowly and deliberately. "I wissh to sspeak to your leader," he calls loudly.

Half a dozen myrmidons emerge from the darkened recesses, accompanied by a naga witch. After intense scrutiny, the female makes a decision. "This is a copy, a creation only. Killing him serves nothing, and we cannot interrogate him magically. Take him to an outbuilding, and we will speak."

Once the clone has been isolated and invited to speak, his message takes the naga by surprise - and provokes anger, confusion, and consideration.

"My message is simply this," the faux-Ezra explains. "Please leave the haunted island at once. The forces allied against you are prepared to attack. They are capable of inflicting serious casualties on you, and are certain to drive you from this place no matter how fiercely you fight. I ask this. Instead, suffer no losses. Retreat now."

"There are good reasons to do so. Rather than dying here, for another chalice foundry and alliance with trolls and goblins, you may live to fight another day, on another shore. You can bring back a strong force, one that would have been lost to your superiors anyway. If you do this, Grom'gol will not attack, nor harry you as you withdraw."

"Your expedition commander knows the name Ezra L. Pyreborn. It seems that my successes against you are known. In that case, I hope you will realize that my wish to spare your lives is also genuine. Please - please leave with your lives intact."

One of the male commanders scoffs. "Mercy from the land-walkers? The naga will not bear this insult. Queen Azshara is--"

He is cut short with a curt wave of one hand from the supreme commander, a two-armed naga of short stature, downcast eyes and quiet voice. "Queen Azshara entrusted this mission to me. There is more that I must ascertain. Send in the priestesses, then leave us." When the hulking male hesitates, the quiet voice speaks again, but there is murder in its stillness. "Leave us or forfeit your life. The ritual must not be disturbed for anything. Not even should the Sundering reverse itself."

Without further comment, the males withdraw. The priestesses arrive in due course. And then the real discussion begins.

---

> (OOC) Sookie says, "GM, over to you :D"

A few hours later, a single naga priestess emerges from the temple doors. The spell she casts is the simple illusion of a shower of sparkling white lights: the signal for surrender.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I don't suppose I can offer them each a drink :)"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "one ping only, Vasili"

Behind her, a column of naga, flanked by their murloc infantry, departs the temple in triple file and heads west, slithering and trooping across the sand until they hit the water's edge. Once in the water, they pick up speed, then disappear beneath the waves.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "GM, I have a thought :)"

As the last of the column disappears, the remaining priestess is joined by three more, as well as Ezra's double, which waves to the airship far above. The five beings hold hands, and a few moments later, Ezra hears a faint whisper in his mind: "Make it look good."

With that, the naga dart back inside the temple, and a fresh barrage of frostbolts emerges from openings in the temple's roof. This time, though, the careful general's eye will note that, even given the lack of range, they seem less well aimed than before.

"We have moved from war to theater," Ezra remarks casually. "Put on a convincing show, my friends."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone want to help out with posing this bit? Or I can cover it..."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'd like a better idea of exactly what is to be posed. It seems the Naga are pretending to resist us."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Yes, plz"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All right, let's see."

The goblin airship is put down at a safe distance from the island, and Grom'gol's finest rush across the beach, roaring in defiance. From within the compound, further magical blasts lash out...

And a frostbolt hits one orc full in the chest... and passes through him. Behind him, he sees what appears to be _himself_, clutching feebly at his flash-frozen chest. And the whistling of the frostbolt bears a whispered message: 'Play dead.'

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "That's the idea. Most of the attacks will miss. The few that appear to hit will be carefully crafted illusions. Make sense?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Are there none here other than a few witches?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "A few witches, a handful of males. The latter will engage at melee range."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "They, too, will be pulling their punches."

> (OOC) TidesGM checks for poses before moving us along

> (OOC) Sookie got nothin else at this time

> (OOC) Nerai is good

> (OOC) Kaliera don't neither.

The charge proceeds unabated, and faces no further resistance - no _real_ resistance, although several "casualties" are left on the sands, remaining near their illusionary 'corpses'. Fully three quarters of the assault force reaches the temple grounds, and a handful of naga males rush to meet them, tridents at the ready.

Kaliera says, "...what is the master plan here?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "did you mean that OOCly?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "no. :) Kaliera really has no idea what we do next."

"Now we sstorm the temple," Ezra replies casually, with several of his illusionary shadows still active. "Once hidden, we may begin the .. terms of ssurrender, with the retreating naga force none the wiser."

Kaliera says, "Ah! I see then."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Time for me to pose something, I think."

For their part, the orcish warriors can immediately tell that although the males lack the illusionary skills of their sisters, they have their own style for deliberately throwing a fight. The first blow of an orcish war axe against a trident knocks the polished coral off the wooden practice weapon, and at no point do the scaly warriors fail to miss an opportunity to press the attack. Even the slightest cut from an orc leaves his foe slumped on the sand, doing his best to feign a mortal wound.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Go ahead :)"

Saeren joins the fray, moving alongside the orcs with her axe raised. Like others, she meets a feigned resistance and quickly lays the foe low with a strike barely fierce enough to draw blood.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "gotta afk to eat for a bit n.n"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "sounds like we're generally in good shape. :)"

The night elf quickly learns something, as well: any time her strike is a little too deep, and actually manages to cut her foe, he immediately becomes a lamia. Taking it in stride, the newborn allies join the charge, helping to swiftly but gently take their 'enemies' down with a maximum of apparent carnage and a minimum of actual pain.

As they approach the temple itself, a dozen naga witches can be seen just inside the doors. They raise their hands, chanting urgently, and a wind whips up, turning into an enormous tornado - which Ezra immediately recognizes as an illusion. The 'twister' tears through the attacking force, to no effect, and as one, the witches bow deeply. The commander slithers forward and smiles, saying in her quiet voice, "Welcome to the Haunted Isle."

Ezra tips his hat politely. "Thank you for a pleassant reception, yess," he offers.

> (OOC) Kaliera has reconnected.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "back now"

"It isss an honor," she replies. "I am called Talasa. Please, come in. I would offer you a drink, but..." She grins a fanged, yet oddly pleasant grin. "As much as I hate to impose upon my guests, I was hoping that _you_ could offer _us_ a drink."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Woot, back just in time, too ^^"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "My pose?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "By all means."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "If you like, you may also include a 100% conversion rate."

Saeren bows to the Naga and draws out a chalice. Moving forward, she offers to each of the Naga the chance to be free. With the first change, Saeren's smile comes, and then again, and again, and again, until the joy of it stings like the bite of a blade and Saeren starts to cry. At last, surrounded by those who are free, she is overcome, and throws her arms around those nearby, pulling close the newest of her growing family. The words of Ezra she hears in her mind and knows that not all can be saved, and much must be lost in this war. Still, in this moment, what has been saved is beyond measure.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "One more to come, but letting others have a chance to add poses here as well."

His part done, Ezra is content to sit hunched in a corner, back braced by part of the temple. He is writing something in a journal. Letters, perhaps, to the Undercity, or whoever else he reports to these days. His hat is pulled down over his eyes. But every so often, he spares a glance up at the scene. Even the face of a Forsaken can show satisfaction.

> (OOC) Kaliera has disconnected.

At last Saeren is able to draw herself up once more, and joy still shines in her eyes. The tears on her cheeks are wiped away by gentle hands, and she laughs, still amazed by what has happened. "My brothers and sisters, welcome home," she says at last, speaking through another flood of tears. In this moment, the night elf looks about her, eager to see one person in particular. Seeing him away from the others, she excuses herself and makes her way to the corner in which Ezra has huddled.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "More coming, let me know if anyone wants to interject.."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Not sure who is here other than Ezra, me, and GM, though.."

> (OOC) Kaliera has connected.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I generally assume everyone's around"

> (OOC) Nerai is reading along, but has nothing.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Ah, welcome back :)"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "sorry, hadda restart the router. again."

> (OOC) TidesGM is doing work stuff for a moment. talk amongst yourselves :)

Stopping short, Saeren calls out, "Master Ezra, surely no greater force for good have I met in my life!" She moves closer, and more softly says, "Thank you so much for this moment. Whatever happens after, I will carry this joy with me. So many are coming home once more."

Ezra looks up briefly, somewhat embarrassed. "Ahh, well, that bussinesss about naga never ssurrendering wass a lie. Or rather, thesse naga knew their true heartss better than mosst. It iss them you should thank."

Talasa, overhearing this, slithers closer and takes Saeren's hand. "It is not just us you should thank, my dearest friend, but the Titans as well. It is they who _changed_ our hearts. Would you like to see the Altar of Naias, and what we found there?"

The wizard glances up again, noting Kagarn approaching. Sookie is with him; she fought aboard the cartel ships as well, protecting her master, and now that the battle is over the pair have flown here. "A lesson on the nature of the elements, eh?" the wizard muses. "The appropriate partiess have jusst shown their facess, yess."

Saeren holds the hand of the Lamia tightly and nods. "Many have worked to bring this day about. I would like to see the Altar of Naias, and learn of its importance." Turning to the newcomers she nods, "Kagarn and Sookie! You made it through without a scratch?"

Sookie is packing a handful of broken-off trident heads, and hefts them in demonstration. "Goshi no injure!" she shouts happily. Nevermind that she's got signs of bleeding and trauma herself - magical healing has already done its work, and all that's left is cosmetic evidence.

Talasa leads the travelers deep into the half-constructed temple complex, eventually reaching the central chamber. "We kept this heavily guarded, and let none in unless we were sure how they would react to the truth," she comments. Inside is a patch of the original sand of the Haunted Isle, surrounding a great, altar-like slab of stone, heavily carved with Titan runes, and with a staircase leading beneath the surface.

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "I'm workin' on it. I finally can afford to send it back, and I'm going to put the old one back in place."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Good :)"

"This was what we came to the Isle to achieve," says Talasa. "It is an elemental node of great geomantic power, and when we came here, that is all we thought it to be. But in truth, this is the entrance to a temple of the Titans. We guess that it dates back to the Ordering. It is a temple... to water."

"The war between the Titans and the Old Gods was, in many ways, a war of ideology over the true nature of the elements. Our former masters extolled the _destructive_ power of the elements - Dagun is the god of water as it drowns, as it suffocates, as it rots and corrupts and wears away at the land. The Titans, of course, had a different idea.

"But there is a difference. Dagun, and his priestesses, preach of water's destructive powers, to the exclusion of all else - and they deliberately _conceal_ that there might be any other way to view the element. This temple not only admits the destructive nature of water, but views it as a good and necessary aspect."

"So this then is a temple to the complete nature of water," says Saeren. "Both the gentle rain and the raging torrent?" comes her guess.

Kagarn muses, as he runs his hand over the ancient stone. The runes convey little to him, but his other senses do much to remedy the lack. "Such is the teaching of the shamans, Saeren," he says. "We are taught the virtues of _balance_, the creative tension between order and chaos. Without order, chaos tears apart and leaves nothing in its place. Without chaos, order builds a perfect and unchanging crystal, lifeless and cold. It is in the balance between the two that we find... life."

"And joy, sorrow, love, hatred, and all else that makes it worthwhile and yet painful to carry on," adds the elf.

Kaliera lags behind, eyes distant, thinking.

"There is more, of course, than just philosophy here," adds Talasa. "There are many secrets here as well, of sorts that an arcanist like myself can fully appreciate. Including ways to purify water _beyond_ purity." She nods toward Saeren, and gestures to her fellow lamia, who have followed behind her. "My sisters and I think that this is the true secret behind your... counter-chalices? Or whatever it is that you call them. If Queen Azshara were to learn _these_ secrets..." She shudders.

"Water iss not unique in thiss," points out Ezra. "Fire burns, and warms. The dwarvess rely on the sstrength of sstone, and mourn those losst to cave-inss. Of the sstorm, we may rely on Ssookie's experience. Thiss dynamic iss a natural part of the elementss. It iss not philosophy; it iss a truth which existss both in the greater cosmic spheress and the lesser material world."

The Forsaken folds up his journal and rises, looking at the runes. "We musst bring the dwarvess here to ssee this, yess. In cooperation with Grom'gol. And with the lamia."

An orc messenger arrives at the entrance to the Altar chamber. "Ezra Pyreborn? There are a number of trolls on the shore, asking for you. I'm no expert, but they don't look like any of the local tribes. They said something about a message you sent them..."

"Ah, the Zandalari." Ezra wheels and strides out.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "gonna --hr-- and let Geoff do his thing."

---

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Go ahead and pose your bit into the log, Geoff. 'spoof' works normally, and '.' is an alias for spoof."

(Note: all of the speech in this is translated from the Zandalari dialect of the Troll language.)

He sits. He waits. His eyes are closed, but still, he watches. The loa have granted him special bonds.

A moment later, the great cat seems to dissolve into being, close enough to him that its natural stealthiness and the color of its coat no longer hide it in the jungle. He reaches out and touches the panther on its head, and the power shifts, bringing his vision back to him.

He is old, for a Troll; his bonds with the loa are strong. He turns to the cheetah near him, touches its head, whispers to him, touches the small token on the collar it has deigned to wear. It dashes off, heading for the water.

The token gives the cheetah great endurance, and as its paws touch the water of the sea, another blessing: it does not sink. With water acting like dirt, it runs, the message of its friend, and its urgency, moving with it, towards islands off the northwest coast of Stranglethorn.

It steps onto sand on the southern of the Yojamba Isles, and makes its way a little more slowly. It arrives at a collection of huts, walking into one of them, unconcerned and causing little trouble.

The troll in the hut turns around as the cheetah enters. "Ah, hello, little brother. What brings you to Falthir?" His eyes are covered with a blindfold, but there's nothing tentative in his movements as he reaches out to touch the cheetah. A sudden whisper is in the air, and he nods. "Wait here, little brother. I will speak with the others and send you back with a message." Tossing the cheetah some jungle-strider meat, he leaves the hut, emitting a set of birdcalls as he does.

The expedition from the Zandilar Isles gathers, the ranking members: Falthir's brother, Al'Tabim the All-Seeing; the warrior Jin'rokh the Breaker; the wise Exzhal; the careful Maywiki; and Molthor, the Hand of Rastakhan.

And Falthir the Blind speaks:

"The Naga are preparing to leave. Their land bases are taken, many of their slaves freed, some of the naga changed by a method we do not know yet. The Goblins and the Horde have allied to drive them out; there were others involved. Our observer noted the mage called Pyreborn there, as well as the creature Sookie. Also an elf, a goblin in steam armor, and a Draenei. They also enlisted the assistance of some of the Bloodscalp tribe, and slaughtered the Bloodscalp leaders to send a message."

There is discussion, debate. Then they decide, and two messengers sent: one a bird, to fly to Rastakhan and deliver the information. The other is the cheetah.

The message: "Please inform the travelers that the Zandalari would like to speak to them, on Yojamba Isle."

When the cheetah returns to its master, the Zandalari hunter named Zu'tal prepares to meet these travelers, and hopes it does not mean his death. (After all, they have had problems with trolls lately.)

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "end"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Shall we cut, and move on to Yojamba for the chat between Ezra and the Zandalari?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sure :)"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "sounds fine"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "ok!"

The council of Yojamba Isle's Zandalari are waiting on the shore as the goblin airship lands on the beach. Being trolls, they waste no time on pleasantries. "Ezra Pyreborn. We hear you used our name amongst the Bloodscalp trolls. We also hear you have a cure for this drowning plague. We can forgive the one, if you will share with us the other."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I assume they don't want me to shoot them."

"That wass alwayss our intention," Ezra replies smoothly. "You have a reputation among the trollss for wissdom. I .. relied upon that reputation, knowing that thiss would pique your interesst." He sets down one of the spare grails the group has with them, along with a sheaf of notes, and steps back.

Maywiki reads the notes carefully, and waves the others close for an impromptu conference. As they break again, Falthir speaks. "We Zandalari are the keepers of our people. It is our role to remember what made the trolls great, and to preserve that greatness until they are prepared to relearn what they truly are. This..." he says, pointing unerringly to Ezra's notes. "This is the greatest threat to our people since the Sundering, and what came after. And it is also the hope of our salvation."

"We cannot ask the trolls to fight alongside you and your allies," says Falthir. "They have forgotten too much of their greatness. But we _can_ ask them to direct their rage against the minions of Dagun. The trolls will join your war, Ezra Pyreborn. The Zandalari are your allies. And the rest of our people... they will not be your allies, but they will be the enemy of your enemy." He bows, as courtly a bow as was ever seen in Stormwind. "And we thank you for giving us the means to survive that war."

Ezra nods. "All dreamss, all hopess, are liess made into truth. And all hisstory is truth that becomes liess without proper care. If the trollss of thiss jungle lissten to your wordss, tell them thiss: there iss a mighty sspirit awakening in the world, and they may profit to worsship it. That sspirit iss the hope of a life without domination by evil. Itss avatarss are the creaturess such as the naaru, and their sservantss. We sserve it. We will not trouble the trollss of the jungle unless we musst."

The wizard steps forward, body becoming a cloud of sand, and steps out a living man. "This spirit of hope is no fiction. It is true power, which you have just seen with your own eyes. Please hold this in the memory of your people as well."

Falthir straightens up as Ezra transforms - though _his_ eyes do not see, his spirit sees perhaps even more clearly what Ezra has done. His companions, gifted in both sight and spirit, are likewise moved. "Do not forget, Ezra of the Horde, that we are still _trolls_," says Falthir sternly, recovering. "When the children of Azshara have finally been dealt with, do not expect the trolls to rush into your arms." He softens again. "But we the Zandalari will remember your words and your deeds, and the wisdom in them. Those trolls who open their eyes... we will be certain that they see." He raises his hand to his blindfold and smiles ironically.

> (OOC) Sookie o\_o b

Ezra grins. "Very well. If you find that your name has been used to .. make other troll tribes see the proper path, remember also that _I am Forsaken_. We here will not forget, and we will be mindful."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "One last pose so we can set up for next time."

Falthir nods, and turns his head toward Nerai, his sightless gaze seeming to fall on the goblin with uncanny accuracy. "Little goblin, this may concern you. You know by now that Booty Bay has fallen to the Drowning Curse. Though we have no great love for your people, we cannot leave them unmolested. Come with me - all of you, come with me - and we will discuss how we will deal with them."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Nerai, you can respond if you like - or that can be closing pose."

> (OOC) TidesGM checks Nerai. You there?

> (OOC) Nerai doesn't have a response yet.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Then let's think about this and start on Booty Bay for next time."
