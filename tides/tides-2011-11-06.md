Lakeshire lies under the pale gray veil of rain. Most of its citizens are avoiding the downpour. A few are on the road, taking shelter from the elements in their own ways or simply enduring the pounding. One is enjoying it.

Far in the distance are the crimson-hued hills which give Redridge its name. Above them are shadowy duplicates formed of angry clouds - a barricade that separates land from sky. Thunder rumbles throughout the mountains. Its echoes send ripples through the lake, and lightning's brilliant flashes are reflected by the waters. Sookie stands out in the open, watching it all.

The girl is wearing the work-clothes lent to her by the villagers; her dress is unsuitable for her current project. But not a bit of it is at all damp, for the rain does not touch her unless she wills it. She stares at the sky, a look of ecstacy and wonder on her face. She cries out to the storm, welcoming it, celebrating it, loving it the way a poet worships beauty.

She stands in the rain for over an hour, savoring the experience, reveling in it. And when the storm has shouted its song across the mountains and the rains have washed their last across the thirsty earth, Sookie walks back to the bridge.

The bridge is pleasant despite the punishing downpour. A glimmering dome of pale gold hovers over the handful of masons, their tools and their mortar supplies. The shield comes courtesy of Kaliera and the Holy Light. It protects the tools from wear, and the mortar from ruination. The supply of stones remain smooth and dry.

Sookie's power levitates the cut stones with the strength of ten men. One mason applies the binding, while the other directs the girl to the proper place for the stone. Kaliera's magic dessicates the mortar instantly, binding one stone to its neighbors. Piece by piece, the bridge assembles itself. What would have been the work of months could be completed by dawn.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "that's all for now :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Any commentary would be fine while I figure out how to lead into the next bit :)"

> (OOC) Sookie can kick off somethin else involvin the other PCs, if you need time

> (OOC) Kaliera has connected.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Go ahead, Sookie. I'll be ready fairly soon."

---

An agreement that unruly neighbors need ejection isn't quite grounds enough for a lamia colony; Solomon, and the rest of Lakeshire, will want more specific details on how, when, and what is to happen. And there is the fact that the lamia are former naga. Consequently, invitations are sent to the Covenant personnel to meet at the Lady's house for breakfast and talks. "Dress appropriately," is the terse directive that accompanies this message. Sookie is nowhere to be found.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "so what do you guys have that looks decent? Show up in that :)"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "How about a ton of shiny armor and armed to the teeth?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "if you think that's appropriate for diplomacy n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Everyone in wow walks around in their armor n.n"

Kaliera pulls on her robes, and over them her tabard of the Hand of Argus; on her head rests the ceremonial circlet of an Anchorite that she carries but rarely wears; on her staff the traditional bells are attached (not usually so for the same reasons), and she takes a bit of extra time to insure her hair is in place, her hooves and horns are polished and waxed, and her tendrils are properly cleaned and arranged. (Draenei, in general, do not wear cosmetics.)

> (OOC) Saeren says, "See, Kaliera dresses nicely. n.n I have my reasons ^^"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Kaliera is the diplomatic one. Also, in WoW, you can wear formal robes into dungeons."

> (OOC) Sookie pushes Saeren into the changing room. come out decent!

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "If worse comes to worse, Kaliera could set her up overnight with some decent Darnassian robes and stuff."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Okay, okay robes it is \*grumbles\*"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Or a suit! We can do that too."

While Saeren is not eager to do so, she is eventually convinced that to appear the part of Moon-mother one must dress appropriately. With Kaliera's help, Saeren is fitted with ornate Darnassian robes and (with more than a few pieces of gold) jewelry appropriate to such a station. She does not leave behind the war wave, of course. She's being diplomatic, not stupid, and insists on bringing every magical item she has to ensure she's ready, just in case something goes horribly awry.

For his part, Kagarn is wearing what he always wears - the traditional garb of the Earthen Ring's shamans. Today he's taken extra care to clean it, and though the threads are a bit loose and the furs a bit matted, he is as much an exemplar of his culture's heroic animists as he was when he first donned it.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "The weapon is neatly concealed, of course."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "and here we go :)"

The Lady's house isn't hard to find again. The woman had no servants on the group's last visit, so they are surprised to see a beautiful blonde human girl in a maid's outfit, opening the door and bowing in welcome. It takes a moment to recognize that it's Sookie. "You are expected," the girl states, and gestures for the group to enter. "Follow me. Breakfast will be served shortly."

> (OOC) Kaliera rolls 3d6 for 13 (6 4 3)

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "....yeah, I think Kaliera can tell some sort of magic is involved."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "if you have something that identifies specific spells, you'd recognize Lend Skill."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Not without casting, I expect. But it was just as "is there... yeah, there's a spell. OK. Sookie's got something on her. Kagarn isn't screaming. Moving forwards." :)"

The maid leads the way into the dining room, where places have been prepared. Solomon is already here, and two of the military men the group has seen earlier; they weren't properly introduced at the time. Solomon rises, and doesn't sit again until the ladies present are in their assigned places. The Lady herself chooses this moment to make her own entrance from the kitchen, and nods in greeting. "Please, ladies and gentlemen, make yourselves comfortable. Business will follow breakfast."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Kaliera, do you speak Darnassian?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Nevermind, I have another option ^^"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Yes, with an accent. :)"

Saeren settles in a seat next to Kaliera, leaning near as she sits to whisper lightly in Draenic, "Is Sookie alright?" A quick smile for Solomon and the others is offered and more clearly the night elf speaks, "It is kind of you to share a meal with us."

Kaliera nods, subtly, at Saeren's comment, catching her eye to make sure Saeren understands.

"We share meals _and_ conversation freely here," the Lady remarks politely. Sookie brings plates and platters from the kitchen, and serves efficiently without remark. "The girl has inherited my knowledge of domestics, etiquette and language for the day. Speak with me if you find any fault with her, please."

> (OOC) TidesGM wedges in a Kagarn pose here.

> (OOC) Kaliera will pose after Kagarn then, depending :)

The tauren shaman's supplies included little in the way of human-like formal attire, but Kaliera did her best, and Kagarn looks... presentable. He nods gravely to the Lady and to Sookie, keeping to himself as best he can. If he is in any way concerned over Sookie's unusually formal speech and behavior, he does not show it.

Kaliera says, "She seemed not quite as we know her, Lady; I was merely reassuring Saeren that there was nothing potentially harmful involved." It is entirely possible that people here might have learned a bit (or more) of Draenic; besides, lying is against the precepts of the Light. "No offense was meant and I deeply apologize if any was given; the lending of such skills was unexpected.""

As plates fill with food, and Sookie pauses to rearrange the freshly-cut flowers decorating the table, the Lady explains. "The problem, ladies and gentlemen, is communication. I do not mean the girl's problem alone. I mean between Alliance and Horde, or between Stormwind and the regions which expect protection from it, or between the young and the old generations. To solve this problem, one must see the value of communication. I am showing this to the girl. Because you of the Covenant see it yourselves, I welcome and support you here. Those of Lakeshire may not be so understanding, however. And so we are here today."

Saeren looks around the table and back to the Lady, "So.. where then do we start?" she asks.

"We start by enjoying breakfast together," the Lady says, and takes a bite of bread. Only after it is thoroughly handled does she speak again. "Sookie, once you have washed up after breakfast, join us in the study please." The girl nods, whispering only "yes my lady" before retreating into the kitchen.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Unless you guys have more to do with breakfast, we'll proceed to that :)"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "This is a time for small talk and socializin )"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "nothin? :)"

Kaliera eats the food, and sometime adds some spices. It's a little bland to her, but after years of nothing but mashed plants and sometimes roast talbuk or warpstrider and a lot of fish, where spices made it palatable, most things taste bland to her.

> (OOC) Sookie will move on unless Saeren has somethin to add then :)

---

The Covenant members move to the study, along with the Lady, Solomon, and his two men; behind them, the soft piling of dish upon dish signals the cleanup. The magistrate of Lakeshire is the first to speak. This is his problem, after all.

"As I explained before, raids from the gnolls of Rethban Caverns have been a problem for us thes many months," says Solomon. "We are grateful to Lady Lainsborough for helping to keep Lakeshire itself safe, but there is little we can do to take the fight to them."

"Is this your primary concern, Magistrate?" asks Saeren. "Or are there several things we should address. Best if we know the truth in full right from the start."

Kaliera has some questions, but waits; at least one of her ideas may be too radical for the magistrate.

Solomon shakes his head. "Of course not. Orcs from the north invaded Stonewatch nearly a year ago, and..." His face looks grim for a moment. "We... know they have no love for humans. But for the time being, they seem content with raiding the caravans that travel north into the Blasted Lands, or resupply missions to Morgan's Vigil. They have left Lakeshire itself alone... for now." He strokes his beard, looking worried. "Though we do not know how long that will last."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "One more pose."

"It is not just for lack of fighting men, of course, though that is a problem as well," continues the magistrate. "Though many of our _own_ warriors are off fighting Stormwind's wars, there are no shortage of sellswords, mercenaries, and other such bands roaming human lands in these days. But we are not a wealthy town, and we cannot afford their hire."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone commenting? Or shall I have one last line?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "waiting for him to finish"

Saeren nods thoughtfully, looking over to Kaliera. "This sounds like the kind of situation we're always stepping into." She turns back to the Magistrate, "Is there anything else we should know?"

Kaliera says, "I would like to know the kinds of things the kobolds raid for."

Solomon shakes his head. "We know little more about our foes. When the kobolds raid us, what they seem to target is food, weapons - or anything that looks or swings like a weapon - and whatever is shiny."

Kaliera nods. "Food, weapons, shiny things." She takes out a small book from her pouch, and a draenei pen, and makes notes.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anything else?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Nope"

One of Solomon's soldiers speaks up. "We're not monsters, please understand. We don't wish the creatures ill will, but it's them or us, and they've made it so. If we can stop enough of them - if they have leaders or shamans or anything of the sort - then hopefully they'll find someone else to bother, and leave us in peace. That's the important thing."

The man's commanding officer, introduced earlier as Colonel Troteman, eyes the distinctly non-human adventurers with some suspicion, then shrugs and speaks up. "I'm still skeptical of your lamia, of course. But I'm also aware of how precarious our position is. A few weeks ago, I sent a handful of the best men we do have to Render's Valley to scout out the Blackrocks, and so far none have returned. So if you _are_ willing to help deal with those who threaten our borders, I don't see that we have any choice but to offer you our gratitude, and legitimacy for your settlers. Just understand that that's pretty much _all_ we can offer you."

Kaliera says, "We are not without our own resources, and laying claim to any of yours would be both rude and unfair. I think we understand that completely."

Sookie has finished washing up, and quietly enters; the only sign of her presence is the click of the door. Without a word she moves to a table and sets out glasses, then begins pouring wine for the guests.

> (OOC) TidesGM has a little filler pose to go with this.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So is kobold another word for gnoll here? ^^ Making sure I understand what they are fighting."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "They're very similar."

The Lakeshire military men begin to smirk and trade glances with each other as they watch Kagarn avidly as the tauren reaches for his own glass, with fingers that are almost as wide as the wineglass himself. The smirks freeze on their faces, however, as Kagarn picks up the glass and sips quietly, with more grace and delicacy than they themselves could muster.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Kobolds are ratlike humanoids, whereas gnolls are akin to hyena-men. It's definitely gnolls around here, and if 'kobold' turned up anytime in today's logs it needs to be edited :)"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "It did, thus my confusion :)"

The Lady's eyes take this in. "Magistrate Solomon, Alma has some of that pipe-weed you're fond of. Perhaps you and your men would like to accompany me to the veranda to sample it." This isn't phrased as a request. As the Lady departs, and her guests follow her unstated wish to leave the adventurers alone, she whispers something in Sookie's ear.

The girl nods and bows. Only after the door is shut does she speak. What she says doesn't sound like the Sookie of old at all. "My dear friends, and master most of all, thank you for taking care of me all this time. I've been a terrible burden to all of you, and I've endangered you in the past. Please accept my apologies. I want to be a help to you. I want to help the lamia too, because they are like me."

Saeren shakes her head, "You are no burden. You are our friend, and we love you." The night elf laughs softly, "And quite frankly, I've gotten us in at least as much trouble as you have since we met."

Kagarn scratches his mane and smiles. "The Lady assured me that she would do nothing to affect your mind - just your abilities. Was she wrong about that?" His expression grows more serious. "Or is this something you have thought for a while, and merely lacked the erudition to explain?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Or is it option 3?"

Sookie smiles shakily. "After the lady's enchantment wears off, I'll be.. trapped again, I suppose. I know what I feel, but it was always a challenge to express it. Kalimag, the language of the elements, is so precise because it comes from the feelings of an elemental, as my feelings do. I can speak my mind using it as a native tongue. The human languages, and even Orcish, are more difficult. To speak my mind felt like navigating river rapids. I always felt out of control. Now, now I know exactly what to say."

"Words are only part of our communication," adds Saeren. "If you feel trapped, then we will all be better teachers so you can express yourself perfectly."

The girl bobs her head. "When this magic wears off, it'll be the last time. The Lady told me I have today only. After that.. I have to work to earn the freedom of my feelings. She offered to teach me while we stay here and fight the gnolls and other enemies we'll find, and while the lamia get settled in. So.. let's do our best together, okay?"

"Every child is a burden," says Kagarn. "We support them because in time they grow, they mature, they learn, and they grow strong enough to stand on their own. I will be honored to have Lady Lainsborough teach you, for she can teach you so many things that I do not even know." He bows deeply. "We will all do our best, Sookie."

Saeren rises from her seat and moves towards Sookie. "So right now, you can not only express yourself, but understand. That means I want to do this now, knowing you'll understand it perfectly." She reaches out to hug the girl, "We all want to be understood, and words have rarely suited me."

Sookie reciprocates happily. "I promise I'll protect you all," she vows. "I'll make you proud of me, even more than you are now."

> (OOC) Sookie is good to roll when you guys are.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm ready :)"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "go for it"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All right. Let's move."

---

With the backlog of stone cleared, Redridge's stonemasons are hard at work again for the first time in weeks, carving fresh boulders into dressed stone. Sookie is on her way to help out again, when she realizes that the work has stopped. This is because everyone is watching intently as a bedraggled man staggers out of the woods to the north. "Solomon... Troteman... Lainsborough... I need to report in..." he mutters, falling to his knees. The stonemasons gather around him, and one rushes for the town hall.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anyone joining in with this, or shall I continue?"

Kaliera steps forwards, casting spells to heal wounds, and then lend him some strength, so that he can deliver his report without falling over.

With Kaliera's assistance, the man is ushered into the town hall and laid on a bench. Colonel Troteman is quick to follow. "Messner! What happened?"

The brown-bearded man clearly finds it difficult to focus, even with Kaliera's aid, but he manages to speak. "We... were discovered and captured," he says. "All of us... imprisoned in the caves at Render's camp. They... were careless and forgot to refresh the wards on my cage, and I escaped... but I couldn't help the others. Please... we've got to..."

Troteman shakes his head. "I... wish I could help, Messner. You know as well as I do that you and Keeshan's expedition were the best we had. But... things may have changed." He looks up at the adventurers, and is loath to speak, but the question is obvious in his eyes.

"We're here to foster goodwill," points out Sookie, still disconcertingly lucid. "This seems an opportunity for us."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Posing :) Are we outside, by chance?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Ah, I see we're inside."

Saeren whistles sharply, and moments later Shade's roar can be heard in answer. "Fortunately I have kept my gear packed and ready." The night elf looks to Sookie, "This is indeed an opportunity." She turns to Kaliera, "Are we ready?"

Kaliera says, "I am prepared."

Troteman bows deeply. "I'm greatly in your debt. Messner..." he begins. The patient shakes his head briefly, and then nods. "I... even with this woman's help, I'm not yet strong enough to walk back myself. But if your friends here can carry me, I can tell them where to go."

Kaliera says, "Can you draw a map for us?"

"Maps we have," says Magistrate Solomon, who has entered while the discussion continued. He pulls a copy from the shelves. "This is a map of Render's Valley," he says, offering a quill to Messner who waves it away. He points a shaky hand at Lakeshire on the map. "We are here..." His finger quivers over a sketch of an orcish hut to the north. "This is where I escaped from."

"If you left a trail, I can follow it," says Saeren. "How many enemies are there? How many were taken?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Ninja death-elf about to be unleashed? :D"

"There are five of us, including me," says Messner. "Orcs... there were dozens of them. I don't know how many exactly." He smiles a little. "I... did my best not to leave a trail on the way out. I wasn't... entirely successful." He raises his left arm; Kaliera's aid has sealed the gash, but it was clearly a very gruesome wound before she got to it.

Kaliera says, "So we may run into some of their trackers on the way there." She shrugs. "We have had to deal with that in the past."

Messner shakes his head, with a feral grin. "Not the ones that followed me. Keeshan didn't pick me for my good looks." He coughs. "I'm just lucky they didn't send more after me, that's all."

"I think it's time to get to work," says Saeren. "I'm going to get dressed for a different kind of meeting, if you can excuse me for a few minutes."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Anything else?"

> (OOC) Saeren should really find an enchant for 'fast armor' :D

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "I can research it :)"

---

> (OOC) Kaliera promises not to require you to spin in place while monochrome light fields make you seem almost but not quite naked.

The orc patrols in the valley itself are poorly organized and even more poorly concealed - Saeren has absoultely no trouble finding a path through them. A small orc encampment waits at the top of Render's Valley - little more than crude wooden huts. Half a dozen dark-skinned orcs loiter outside, most in leather armor, with two lurking at the entrance to the caves themselves.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Hmm.. wonder how fast I can kill them all >.>"

"There were a lot more inside," whispers Messner. "If these lot sound the alarm, it... won't be easy to get in any deeper."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "What's the plan?"

"Together we could kill them within a few seconds," whispers Sookie to Saeren. "But that depends on there not being more out of sight."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "You have no specific information about that. The most you can be sure of is that Saeren hasn't spotted any other orcs than the ones you can see."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "yeah, just pointing out :)"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Shade would have been tracking as well. So they would need to be out of sight and scent."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "His tracking is 18, if rolls are needed, gm :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM \*rattles dice\* "All you and he have spotted were the patrols on the way in. They're way out of the way for the time being."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "okay. proposal: Sookie sneaks close. she can kill 2 sentries near the entrance in 2 seconds, breaking their necks. That should silence them. Saeren can knock over two per second from range. Sookie will stay near the door to watch for runners, and Saeren + Kaliera sneak close"

"Shade's nose isn't likely to have been fooled. I think we can make quick work of them. The only uncertainty in my mind is the cave itself," says the night elf. "Still, a narrow point like that is just the kind of place where I could cut them down without stop."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "And Shade will stand ready for ultra fast movement. Kaliera, can you ride?"

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 1d+6 for 10 (4 6)

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 1d for 2 (2)

> (OOC) Sookie says, "okay. GM, need rolls? or just poses?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Let's do poses for now. There'll be time for rolling later."

> (OOC) Sookie sets up then.

Sookie darts off among the rocky outcroppings that make up this part of the region. Only Saeren's sharp eyes are able to pick out her signal, once she's achieved her point of ambush - almost right above the cave entrance. Below her are the sentinels. Simultaneously both orcs stiffen, as Sookie efficiently snaps their necks.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Doing a quick count for how many I should kill here.. four?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "there's 6 left by my count"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Ah, yeah.. two at the cave. used to be.."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "There are six orcs around the hut; they haven't noticed that the cave guards are dead."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "and seeing those guys drop should be a good signal to knock over the others immediately :)"

Saeren can tell from the slight shift of Shade's ears that two orcs have fallen to the ground. The night elf's shots are precise, her aim brutally efficient. The arrows cutting the air shoot out throats and faces with equal effect. As the first two orcs falls, clutching at the arrows the next two raise their weapons. It is useless. The blades fall from unfeeling fingers seconds later. For the last, Saeren wastes no time. First two shots maim them, and then two more arrows land, and two more, and two more. The night elf vanishes from sight with the last, slipping onto Shade's back and changing to a different vantage point far faster than any on foot should be able to.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "When your weapon has infinite ammo, why stop shooting until you know they are dead, right?"

There is a strangled cry from a few of Saeren's victims, but nothing loud enough to carry beyond the valley. The orc encampment is soon overtaken by the silence of the grave, puncutated only by a death rattle from the single orc unlucky enough to take a few seconds more to die. Messner is wide-eyed - the orange glow between his hands fading before it had even had time to grow. "And I thought _we_ were good," he whispers to Kaliera.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I'll move us along a bit. Sookie is occupied on phone, but I'll have us ready for the main event by the time he's done."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I will have sound vision on for this."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Basically you can assume I turn this on every morning, since activation has a cost and maintenance does not n.n"

> (OOC) Sookie is back

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I'll put Dark Vision up as well, I can maintain it indefinitely"

As the adventurers venture into the cavern, they find the inner reaches rather more lightly guarded; a handful of orcs at regular intervals, easily spotted and dispatched by either Sookie or Saeren before any of them can so much as squeak. Messner's amazement slowly gives way to concern. "I thought there'd be more than this," he mutters.

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Sorry. Roommate father passed by and my presence was required x.x"

Kaliera says, "I hope they did not suddenly to all gather in one place," very quietly. "That could be problematic."

Saeren turns to Messner, "Why did you think so?" Those words are not the kind to be taken lightly.

Messner rubs his chin. "There were more when I was sneaking out, that's all." He doesn't seem to be taking it lightly, either. "They occasionally had meetings deep inside the cave - I _hope_ that's all it is."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "we're also hiding bodies out of sight as we go, I trust. <\_<"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I assume you guys aren't stupid, and if you forgot one, Messner would remind you."

"I don't doubt your eyes," says Saeren. "And I don't like the thought that we might be entering a trap, either. At this point, I would hate to withdraw. I don't wish to abandon anyone to torment."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "no feeling of any elemental magic in the place, GM?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "There's something vaguely earth like, but it's hard to distinguish from the background noise."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "so the wards that he mentioned on the cages are non-elemental? okay."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "and/or I just can't feel em."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Correct. He could tell you that they were specifically arcane magic."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I am running with see invisible as well, for the record. n.n"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Pause to spellcast?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "you want to stop and cast somethin? go for it."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Good time for it."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Whatcha casting?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Sense observation, on Saeren and on Sookie."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Nothing."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "it's good for an hour"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "yes"

> (OOC) Kaliera poses

Kaliera says, "Hold a moment." She reaches out, whispering; the glyph appears faintly in front of her head as she reaches out to touch Saeren, then Sookie, on the shoulders. She looks slightly winded, but pleased. "If anyone sees you... you will know, whether they use eyes or magic."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. Well, no problem casting at al."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Any other preparations?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "yeah, just a moment"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm basically armed and ready to kick ass, so n.n"

> (OOC) Sookie is good :)

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Do I know IC that these orcs work with dragons?"

Kaliera then takes a moment to send a message to Solomon: "The orc presence here is very light; they may be about to raid your town."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I don't think so, Saeren."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I think the extent of our plan here is 'use stealth, get to the captives, get them out; if at any time we encounter orcs, kill them quickly; if it turns into a mob, fight them'"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sounds good. I think I'm the most stealthy still, at this point, with no smell and mage stealth."

A few more tunnels separate the party from their target at the back of the cave - the prisoner cages from which Messner escaped. Except... they're empty except for a single, particularly dark-skinned orc inside Messner's former abode. "Ah. I was beginning to think you'd never arrive," he says in flawless Common, pushing open the cage door.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "grab him by the neck."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Hide in the shadows."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "What's the ST on your TK again, Sookie?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "While Sookie prepares to kill, I'll try to remain hidden."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "30."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I can apply it twice if I use both mental compartments. That doesn't mean ST 60 though"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Understood - it means two independent attacks."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Which he defends against as if they were from an invisible attacker."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Yeah"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "I'm going to assume you make your attack rolls..."

For such a bulky orc, he is surprisingly light on his feet. As Sookie begins to flicker with the colors of the storm, he ducks and weaves as if being clutched at by unseen arms. "Impressive!" he says, blowing a horn that echoes through the cave. Behind them, the adventurers can hear footsteps. Lots of them.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "just tell me when to take another crack at this. --\_"

> (OOC) Sookie rearranges face

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Next round."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Go for it, Sookie."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "compartment 1: grapple the neck with Deceptive Attack. effective skill is 13 (-3 hit location, -4 deceptive attack). his defense is at -2."

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 9 (1 5 3) vs. 13, succeeding by 4

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 12 (4 6 2) vs. 10, failing by 2

> (OOC) Sookie says, "9d lightning attack. no range penalty, aiming for the face (modified skill 18)"

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 9 (4 2 3) vs. 18, succeeding by 9

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm going to kill him, unless someone objects?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "nope"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "he can totally defend against this, except I've grabbed him by the body part just below my aim, so figure out if he can even move. dodge is at -1, dx is at -4 for being grappled"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I want to put two arrows in his head with that."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "What's my range, btw? ^^"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Range penalty is -2."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I've had at least a few turns to aim, so this should be fun ^^"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "anyway, whatever defense he has against lightning happens here"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "No defense except that he raises an arm as if to ward it off. This is not a particularly effective maneuver for blocking."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "damage:"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "If he's got eyes left, GM, let me know :D"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I think the last thing he saw was a bright light.. and then a long dark tunnel ;)"

With another gesture from Sookie, the orc is pinioned neatly by the neck, and his upraised arm does little to ward off the blast of lightning that lights the cave with dazzling brilliance... followed by an unnaturally deep bellow. Sookie can feel the neck expand and grow, as his body twists and writhes... and grows. His leather armor turns black-scaled and merges into his body, and giant bat-wings erupt from his growing back.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "He does, indeed, still have eyes. Go for it, Saeren."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Alright, two eye shots.."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Of course he's a black dragon. ^^"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm going to shoot every second, of course. Let me know when I can shoot again :)"

Saeren's War-Wave sings, and two watery arrows plunge directly for the creature's eyes. Only a lightning-fast twitch of the shapeshifting limb keeps the shafts from plunging directly into his eyes, and the two wounds glow with Elune's wrath as the orc - no, the black dragon - roars in pain. "MOST IMPRESSIVE!" he booms, as his taloned feet land on the cavern floor, his transformation complete.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "It's an open cavern, though there's plenty of stalagmites for cover around the place."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'd send Shade in, but honestly this is beyond that cat's power right now. I need to up him to 75% ally and raise str to about 50 for this kinda fight >.>"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "ironically, sumi stopped playin a druid among other reasons because the D&D pet mechanics were unwieldy :D"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Shade's got enemies his own size coming. YOu can hear them coming down your route of escape."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "OK, so a portal seal is useless. I am going to cast a spell at the dragon, which is going to be potentially hilarious but if it works, hooray."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I have a feeling it's gonna be /real/ quick o.O"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "to make it more reasonable, you have the option to scale our ST down proportionately. for example, if I have 30 and he has 45, you can roll that as 10 vs. 15"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "yeah. does less damage. range is -2?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "if he's free, I'm going to grab myself with compartment 2, so I can fly and maneuver if need be."

Sookie is pure white from head to foot, and is maximizing her power output. But the dragon is too nimble for her next lightning bolt.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Roll attack, Saeren."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Yes, eyes."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Dodge."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Jesus o O"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So basically I can't possibly hit this guy."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "yeah. I've got two more things to try."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Sure you can. You just have to get lucky, or something else has to happen like Sookie succeeding at grappling him again."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Indeed.. and tells me I gotta find a way to deal with dodge monkeys :)"

> (OOC) Kaliera pauses, puts magical items away, takes nap.

The dragon's head ducks and weaves as Saeren's arrows dart by him. "Persistent little worms!" he barks, and begins to draw in a deep breath.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "alright. As he tries to breathe on us, I'm going to try and clamp his jaws shut. this is a pair of Waits leading to All-Out Attack (+4), Deceptive Attack (-8, for -4 to defense)."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "his SM and the hit location penalty should cancel each other out"

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 10 (6 2 2) vs. 16, succeeding by 6

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 9 (3 2 4) vs. 16, succeeding by 7

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 13 (6 5 2) vs. 8, failing by 5

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 8 (4 1 3) vs. 8, succeeding by 0

> (OOC) Sookie says, "enjoy a mouthful of breath weapon."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Nice n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "This makes me think of Willow."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "During those waits is time passing so I can unload arrows? ^^"

The breath draws in. Sookie remembers the lore of dragons well enough - they are perhaps the most famous creatures on Azeroth - and as the creature's mouth contorts, she claps her palms together and yells. The force of the storm, that mighty power which can uproot trees and decimate cities, obeys her command. The thing's jaw is caught.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Going to roll my attack out of sheer excitement n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d6 for 16 (4 6 6)

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d6 for 12 (4 4 4)

> (OOC) Saeren says, "16 isn't a crit fail, is it?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "17 or 18 are critical fails."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Then both are hits, even for the eye with that sm."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All right. Go ahead and roll, wounding modifier of x4."

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d+2 for 15 (4 6 3 2) damage

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d+2 for 10 (1 4 3 2) damage

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Both +2 moonfire, divisor 3, impaling."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "THat does lotsx4 of damage."

And a raging torrent of flame spews out in all directions, a broad sheet of flame flashing yards above the heads of the adventurers and splashing against the walls of the cave with a soundless roar. And though his eyes are shut tight, Saeren's arrows still pierce through the lids.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Courtesy of Sookie ^^"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "The no defense is indeed courtesy of sookie."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "And he's... not dead. Roll at 10, Sookie. Time for him to try to break free again."

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 9 (5 3 1) vs. 13, succeeding by 4

> (OOC) Sookie says, "'all die rolls are modified favorably by 2', thanks to the blessing. that's probably a +1 at most with the scaling."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Yes."

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 12 (3 6 3) vs. 11, failing by 1

> (OOC) Sookie says, "no good"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "if both grapples hit, I'm in good shape"

"ENOUGH!" roars the dragon, shaking his head drunkenly and coughing black smoke. Unfurling his wings, he barrels down the cavern in full retreat, the passage of his wings buffeting the adventurers in his haste.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "okay! grappling the dragon. two all-out attacks, deceptive. He might still be evading me but with crippled eyes (I HOPE) and looking away, he'll still tend to miss. skill 20, -10 for deceptive, +4 all out, +2 blessing."

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 13 (3 5 5) vs. 16, succeeding by 3

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Now... let's see how to resolve that successs."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I've still got him"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "just not as strong as I'd like"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Crippled eyes are irrelevant to dodging your TK, Sookie."

> (OOC) Saeren kicks RL..

"Not yet!" shouts Sookie. Once again her power reaches out - this time seizing the beast's tail.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Saeren, you get to fire again. But he's not facing you, so no more eye shots."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "And on the other hand, he's at -4 to dodge."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "skull shots at -7 are perfectly okay. o\_o"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Can I hit his skull?"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Yep."

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d6 for 9 (3 5 1)

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d6 for 10 (2 3 5)

> (OOC) Saeren says, "By plenty."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Actually, it's at more than that, since he has to use magic dragon hax senses to even dodge you at all from behind."

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 14 (2 6 6) vs. 8, failing by 6

> (OOC) TidesGM rolls 3d6 for 13 (2 6 5) vs. 8, failing by 5

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Thonk."

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d+2 for 13 (3 3 5 2) damage

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d+2 for 15 (5 5 3 2) damage

> (OOC) Saeren says, "+2 moonfire, arm div 3, etc.. impaling."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "He goes down but he's still crawling, his tail twitching as he tries to break free. Pose the hits."

Saeren's got one more chance to put this damn creature down. She doesn't waste the opportunity. Two more arrows fly, and thanks to Sookie's timely grappling they strike the dragon's skull from behind, shredding through armored flesh and biting deep into the enemy. Saeren doesn't waste time celebrating any victory, she's already drawing again, glaring at the fallen dragon, its tail twitching as it seeks escape.

> (OOC) Saeren says, "With luck the orcs will arrive just in time to soil themselves.. need to hit this thing twice more for the kill."

The dragon bellows one last time. "Get them, fools!" he roars. As he does so, a horde of orcs swarms around the dragon on either side - and he suddenly shrinks from view, as Sookie feels his tail shrink and vanish in her grasp. The orcs quickly close ranks around where the dragon had been.

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "It's now the PCs' turn. Sookie, your elemental sense does /not/ in fact pick out the dragon. It merely indicated the dragon had been using his native magic in the cavern. So if you want to grapple the dragon again, you get to play "guess the orc"."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "in that case we'll deal with the crowd first."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Shade can smell the blood."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "C1: lightning bolt to a random orc. C2: all-out attack, rapid strike, shove vs. two other nearby orcs."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "LB:"

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 3d for 8 (3 2 3) vs. 21, succeeding by 13

> (OOC) Sookie rolls 6d for 21 (4 5 3 1 2 6) damage

> (OOC) Sookie says, "no defense penalty, dodge is the only legit defense. but if one dodges, it'll probably hit one behind him :P"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "You just succeed at doing as you please to ordinary orcs. So you have one crisyp orc and two bowled-over orcs. I'll let you know if you get lucky."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "right on"

Growling, Sookie unleashes a lightning bolt into the crowd, and gestures, knocking two more orcs back. And those two in turn slam into the orcs behind them...

> (OOC) Sookie says, "good time for scattershot, acid wand, aoe attacks, the works"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Shattershot on two.. that's what, 2 fp? :)"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "or whatever you have that does fragmentation damage"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "It fragments.. going to do it at -4 for 3d damage."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "First, the two shots.. orcs, at this range.. might as well do face shots. It's max chance to hit."

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d6 for 5 (2 1 2)

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d6 for 5 (1 3 1)

> (OOC) Saeren says, "And imbue rolls"

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d6 for 11 (6 3 2) vs. 13, succeeding by 2

> (OOC) Saeren rolls 3d6 for 9 (6 2 1) vs. 13, succeeding by 4

> (OOC) Sookie says, "at your skill level, that's going to crit anyway :)"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "How many orcs do you hit with that?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "That's 15 radius for each shot, both do 3c"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "3d, even."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I will spread to ensure everyone in a 30 foot spread gets a taste."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "it'd 3d fragmentation damage, like a grenade. the fragments attack everyone else in range with ane ffective skill of 15."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sorry, 15 yards."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "for every 3 points by which that attack roll succeeds, another fragment hits. only valid defense is dodge and drop. frag damage is cutting."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "So I think they probably all eat both shots."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Including the dragon, at this point >.>"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "OK. Saeren, pose about half the orcs getting hit by that shit."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Fixed."

Saeren focuses inward, drawing more and more of the power of her spirit into the weapon. With a roar that lasts the whole volley two arrows are fired into the mass of orcs. They erupt in a pair of blasts that tear the orcs apart, leaving half their number shredded to death and the others dripping blood from shrapnel wounds.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I'm actually shocked that nobody has laid a finger on us so far. do these guys even ave ranged attacks?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Technically I think the damage is moonfire burning."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "These guys only just showed up. They didn't have time."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm sure a few of the dead guys had bows. n.n"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "If Ezra were here, they'd even get a chance to use them.. against their friends."

Orcs are notorious for bloodthirsty bravery. But seeing their companions decimated - and more importantly, seeing the black dragon taking to his heels and apparently vanishing from their midst - is enough to cow even the bravest and stupidest orc. As one, they all take to their heels, leaving weapons behind in their frantic attempt to make sure some _other_ orc is closer to the enemy than they are.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I'm going to grab a couple of them."

Reaching out with her power, Sookie seizes a pair of the retreating orcs and floats them bodily back to where she stands, spinning them in place so that they face her. "Who stronger?" she demands in Orcish. "Black dragon? Or us?"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm going to kill as many as I can."

While Sookie makes her point, Saeren helps drive it home. Caves are dark, but she has no need of light to see. Two more arrows fly, and with a thunderous explosion she makes it rather unlikely that any whisper of what happened here shall be taken home by the fleeing orcs. With a glare she wheels back to face those that Sookie holds, bow drawn and ready once more. "Give the word, Sookie, and I will help one of them decide."

"You!" "You!" both orcs answer, as fast as their gibbering mouths can move.

"Dragon not part of clan!" shouts the girl. "You take order from strongest, that me, so here order: you prisoner. You come back to town. You tell us dragon's plans. Then you get chance to prove brave or not. Cowards die, brave live. Agree, or we kill and pick two more stupid orc."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Sookie's diplomacy is the ideal level for these guys, I think."

> (OOC) Saeren says, "Kaliera should probably make sure they aren't so wounded they are going to die on us. >.>"

The two orcs nod hurriedly. One of them is still bleeding from a spread of shrapnel wounds. "<Whatever you say!>" he says, not even considering whether or not his unquestioning obedience is a sign of cowardice. "<We don't know much, but what we know, we tell,>" says the other.

> (OOC) Sookie says, "Yeah. Kaliera is actually going to be awesome here. I think you have Sense Emotion and/or Truthsayer and/or Detect Lies? you can triage the ones willing to play along"

Sookie smiles sweetly. "I think I've secured the cooperation of the captives," she explains to her friends.

> (OOC) Sookie has nothin else, thinks this is good for tonight - whatever you guys have goes here :)

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I'm guessing at this point the captives are dead?"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "these two? noooo"

> (OOC) Saeren says, "I mean the people we were sent to save."

> (OOC) Sookie says, "ah yeah. well that's the first question isn't it"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "I figured we could save that for next time tho, since it's 9pm"

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "Yeah, that's what I'd like to do."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "All right. Any closing poses, or shall I wrap for tonight?"

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "Actully, I have none of those."

> (OOC) Kaliera says, "So I'm still not really useful. :/"

> (OOC) Sookie says, "oh? I must be remembering wrong."

> (OOC) TidesGM says, "We'll have to do something about that, since those would be fundamental skills for diplomacy in adverse conditions. And here's the first step to doing something about that:"
