36 takes the Orb to the Library. Behind the desk, the duty librarian looks somewhat bemused at the presence of the clanking mechanical man. 36 explains what he's looking for, and the librarian shows him to a stack of travelogues collected by University staff over the years. The librarian then departs, leaving 36 and the orb to conduct their search.

It could take days to search through every book on every shelf, so 36 starts with a few generic compilations in newer bindings. All are hand sketches reproduced with painstaking efforts through plate lithograpy. It's easy enough to start at page one and work forward from there.

The orb shows the greatest feeling of familiarity for pictures that have mountainscapes in the background. Pictures bearing solely vegitation seem generically familiar, in the sense that the sphere, apparently, has seen a lot of trees. Particular skylines, on the other hand, have an accompanying feeling of uniqueness.

One might argue whether 36 has a weak grasp on time, or if time has a weak grasp on 36. In either case, several hours pass, and 36 works through half of a comprehensive gazetteer of the World, or at least as much of it as the University has visited. And then 36 notices something about the sphere... it's floating.

It could easily be missed. The sphere rises about an inch off the surface of the reading table, floats shakily in the air for a few minutes, and then sinks back to the table. It does this at irregular intervals, creeping closer to a shaft of sunlight that shines in from a high window.

36's head wobbles slightly as he alternates between reading and peeking at the sphere. Finally he extends a careful manipulator, and lightly pushes it - in the direction of the sunlight.

The sphere rolls along the floor, maybe a little further than it was entitled from the momentum of 36 's push. The sphere comes to rest precisely in the center of the beam of light. Its "voice", which only 36 can hear, seems to become stronger.

Communicating with the sphere is slow going, but it seems to go more quickly when its illuminated by sunlight. Searching the gazetteer reinforces the notion: the sphere can recognize skylines and mountain ranges, but it is less adept at understanding treelines and vegetations. The strongest reaction of the lot comes from a single plate in the middle of the book, which is a reproduction in outline from the rim of a river valley, with a high glacier-covered mountain range in the background.

The impressions coming from the sphere are particularly muddled over this image. It seems to recognize the mountains, but not the river. And then there's a confused impression involving... mud.

The single plate is the strongest reaction in the whole book. 36 carefully reads the caption; 'Ice River Valley, Far Interior.' The sketch is signed by Lord Renforth Tys himself. There's no other reference on the page.

The whole process has taken several hours. Despite having a clockwork body, 36 isn't exactly aware of the time; but the shaft of sunlight coming in from the window is past vertical. The sphere has moved to stay in its center, and seems to sparkle at odd intervals. Footsteps announce the approach of Fredric and a different librarian from before.

Fredric shakes his head. "We've been looking for you. I should have taken you at your word. The Chancellor would like to meet our new arrival. Please come with me." He waits expectantly.

36 creaks and whines as he reaches for the book with one hand. He pushes it off the table by accident, but manages to recover it from the floor. Reaching for the sphere, he manages more delicacy in handling. "I found.. zzomething familiar," he buzzes.

Fredric picks up the book, not quite comprehending. "Familiar to you? Or to the sphere?" He asides to the librarian, "Guess I'll take this one. We'll show ourselves out."

"To it." 36's pulleys engage, sending him fully upright and clanking along to walk with Fredric.

Fredric leads the way towards the Chancellor's office, high in the old Tys manor house. "Show me when we get there," he says.

The office of Bandwul, the Chancellor of the University, is on the third floor of the old manor, one step below the attic and the clock tower. Ascending the stairs is no mean feat. Fredric has been at sea for some time, and so is in pretty good shape; 36 sees one step pretty much the same as any other. Still, it's remarkable that for such a (literally) high office, Bandwul is a florid and somewhat overweight man with long sideburns. "Ah! Fredric," he begins. "Back from the wilds, I see. And you've brought the mechanical man with you. And... ah. That must be the ... new item." He removes himself from behind his gigantic oak desk in a motion reminiscent of a ship leaving port, and yet manages to kneel gently before 36's cradled claws. Of 36 himself, Bandwul takes no further note.

Fredric sets down the gazetteer on a long coffee table that also holds a globe, and retrieves a magnifying glass. "One of the students - Linkletter, I think - says it's made of diamond. But feel that - it's incredibly light, like it's hollow. Oh! And it's warmer than it was before. Well, it was sitting in a sunbeam..."

"Diamond?" Bandwul gets an avaricious glint in his eye, but it fades quickly. "Damned strange diamond, though, to be perfectly spherical, and so clear. They don't come like this in nature, and I've seen a few. Maybe some new kind of glass? They made so many odd things out of glass in the East..." He gingerly takes the sphere from 36, as if he's afraid of breaking it, and moves towards a workbench on the other side of the room. "So... have you run any tests?"

Fredric shakes his head. "None yet. We just found it, and I've only been back since yesterday. I guess it's been with 36 the whole morning. He's been... reading to it. I think." He picks up the book again and hands it to 36. "What was that you were saying earlier, about a familiar picture?"

"Huh? I didn't say anything about a picture," Bandwul replies, thinking the question is meant for him. "Do you know this thing only weighs an ounce? But it feels more hefty. Much stronger than it looks."

36 raises a digit. "Please put it near zzunlight, and wait, Chancellor," he suggests. His head shifts to look at Fredric. "It told me about places. It wants to travel. I.. wanted to find out where."

Bandwul startles when 36 speaks. For a moment the Chancellor looks unsure about what he's heard; but a nod from Fredric prods him forward, and he regains his composure. "Yes, very well, in sunlight, then." He carries the sphere near a window and places it on a velvet pillow, which is already covered in cat hair. Meanwhile, Fredric is flipping through the book, examining the picture that 36 found. "Well. This one was done by the Old Lord himself, on one of his trips upriver."

Meanwhile, 36 clanks his way to the pillow. He gingerly reaches for the sphere, intent on moving it just out of the light.

36 pushes the sphere a few inches away from the sunbeam, and the sphere promptly rolls right back into it. Bandwul's brows furrow. After a long moment, he says, "Do that again."

36 looks back at the Chancellor, then resets the sphere just as he did.

The sphere rolls back across the pillow, into the exact center of the available sunlight, amidst a pile of white and brown cat hair. Bandwul is barely moving. "Is it... alive?" he asks in a whisper.

36's head wobbles. "Yes. Like me."

Fredric finally notices the exchange, and walks over to join in. "What did you say?" he asks of nobody in particular. "Alive? Isn't it a rock? A mineral object? Chancellor, are you feeling alright?"

Bandwul returns to his deks and takes a seat. "I'm fine. Well." He pauses. "Alive like Mister 36, then. Hardly something for a menagerie or a display case. And you brought it back, Fredric? I'd say that puts you in the best position to find out where it's from."

Fredric looks puzzled. "Well, yes, sir, only I've just got back from six months at sea..."

36 raises a digit again. "I can."

Fredric and Bandwul both fall silent for a beat. "Well... maybe he's right," Fredric says. "Here. Look at this." He shows the book to the Chancellor. "This is from a sketch that Old Tys did on one of his trips inland. This place is about six hundred miles northeast. It's the furthest that anyone has ever been into the interior. 36 says that the sphere... recognizes it."

Bandwul looks at the book, and then back at 36. "Alright... how did you do that?"

The machine's watery eyes regard the Chancellor steadily. "Do what?" he buzzes softly, curiously.

"How did you speak to it," Bandwul asks with great patience. "How did you get it to tell you that this place, on this page, is where it wants to go."

36 thinks a moment, tapping his manipulators against his hull. "I have seen," he says at last, "teachers look at students. They do not speak. But the student knows that he has been told to behave. It... is like this, I think. We speak without sound."

As Bandwul considers that, Fredric finds a chair and sits. "That expedition into the northern interior," Fredric says. "Isn't that the one where only Lord Tys returned alive? About a week ahead of a blizzard that froze the river solid?"

Bandwul raises an eyebrow. "Probably," he says. "But I believe what 36 is saying. We've heard shamans say the same kinds of things, about speaking with spirits. So why not?"

"It does not recognize the river. It knows mud," volunteers 36.

Fredric grins. "Well that's not surprising. It was encysted in sediment... hmm. I wonder if it might have fallen into the river and gotten buried. And if it lives on sunlight that would explain why it's been dormant the whole time..." Suddenly the professor seems very interested in the whole matter. "You know, Bandwul, we could do it. We could put a steam engine on a barge and make the trip in a few weeks."

Bandwul considers this. "For fortune," he says slowly, "or for glory?"

"It wishes to go home," 36 says quietly.

"For philanthropy?" Fredric suggests.

Bandwul nods. "Well. Make a budget. Bring it to me. We'll see. Unless you're too worn out from six months at sea," he jests.

Fredric snorts. "Really, sir."

Bandwul shrugs. "You brought it up, not me. I think that's all for now." He rises again and heads for the door. "I seem to have misplaced my cat. Feel free to show yourselves out."

"Thank you," hums 36.
