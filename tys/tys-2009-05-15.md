The river is a novel sensation for 36. The waters rush past like a strong wind. It's colder and darker than a moonless night. And there are voices...

36 is privy to the argument between First of Six Points and the Herald. The speech of the two spirits is confusingly fast and they fire words at each other like nagging magpies. This too is novel; for most of the lore of shamans is about encounters between people and spirits, and not the spirits themselves.

Something that might be words hiss out of 36's speaker grill, but the mechanical man understands more than can be heard with ears. _You usurp us,_ the Herald challenges. _We would bring life to this place. What you have wrought is a travesty. It is our purpose to set it right._

_We have brought what is right,_ First of Six retorts. _To undo what we have done is evil. Your meddling has cost us much already._

_We shall continue to meddle!_ the Herald screeches. _The others come! You have weakened since your arrival! You are old and worn! We are the future! You cannot stop all of us!_

They continue in this fashion as 36 sinks. Though the river is wide and shallow, the argument takes place as fast as 36 can think, and often faster. When he lodges in the mud and rock at the bottom, it seems as though hours have passed. Somewhere along the way, the Herald grew silent. 36 can no longer hear his taunts. Nor can he hear First of Six, either.

36 considers the matter silently. Has he lost his grip of the Herald? At least the settlement is clear, he reflects.

36 tips onto the riverbed, and rolls, his watery eyes staring up through watery skies. The last echos of the Herald's shouts linger in his ears, but the spirit is gone. There is something else now, something in the rushing of the river...

In contrast to the Herald and First of Six, the River speaks in a slow, measured cadence. Rarely does one speak to such a being, because the lives of men are too ephemeral; but right here, right now, with so few distractions, 36 feels the constraints that hold him in human form loosen, and he sees as a river sees. It knew of the Herald, and considered it a worrisome annoyance, like a man might consider a sneeze the sign of a cold to come. Somehow the river knows that others have dealt with the pest, and it relaxes. _Speak, little one._

_I brought a spirit here to keep it from the people above,_ explains 36 silently. _Please pardon the intrusion._

_They come and they go,_ the river sings, _like the tides and the ice. That one threatened ruin. His kind always do. They have yet to make good on their threats._

_That is good,_ replies 36. _I was led here by someone named Alec. He said that you might have some interest in our journey. Thank you for being hospitable to us so far._

_Al-ec._ The word seems unfaimilar to it. _Yes. Those of your world are as ripples upon my skin. I count you not and know not your names, and yet some of your words are rain-on-the-mountain. Alec. One of Alec's tributaries met the Herald. Alec wished to clear the choking weeds. I shared what I knew. Words that came to me over many seasons._

36 considers this. _He and his father both hurt,_ he says at last.

A ripple, that in a man might be a shrug. _That is a great misfortune. I have felt loss only once. If you or I have spared that of someone else, then we have done what is right._

36 considers again. _Alec received an omen that his herbs would be useful. I wish to know how he did it, if others need help and I can be called on. Do you know who told him what was needed?_ he asks after a pause.

Another ripple. _The Tall Man,_ it replies. _That is how he thinks of himself. He once sought the headwaters. I have frozen and thawed nearly one hundred times since he came to walk these banks._

_Is it wise to speak to him?_ asks 36.

The river hums around 36 in its contemplative hush. _I flow to the sea, no matter what he does. For you? I know not what is wise for those who breathe._

The mechanical man would whirr if he weren't shut down. _I don't breathe, it's true,_ he answers. _I am like you. I wish to be like them as well. River, is there any way we can aid you?_

Contemplative hush. Then, a bubbling. _There is an... interruption... in my recall. I have frozen and thawed thousands of times. But the world is older than that, and so am I. Perhaps it would be well for me, to know what came before the pain._

The experiment contemplates in the cold dark of the river. _I will ask, then. When I find out, I will tell you._

Something is rippling in the waters above 36, darting back and forth very quickly. _I will be here,_ the river says. And then something has a hold on the mechanical man. There's a blur that feels like a mere second, but as 36 adjusts, he understands that he has been back on the surface for several minutes. The slow, unshakable pace of a river's mind is not for the world of light and breath.
