The expedition's new means of transport makes short work of the rapids, by simply rolling past them on land. It still takes all day, and Gerald spends a considerable amount of time fixing minor breakdowns. However, on land, a breakdown is merely an inconvenience.

Captain Teague sends a squad of horsemen to escort the expedition, and so it's easy to see that the contraption is as fast as a horse at a trot - when it works. Reactions from the soldiers are mixed. "I like horses," one of them says. "You don't make friends with a coal fire!"

"You don't have to muck out a coal fire's leavings, either," another replies, which draws a few laughs.

Gerald, overhearing this, chuckles to himself. "They're both wrong," he says. "You _do_ have to clean the ashes out of a boiler. But then again..." he glances at Wulfgang as he fusses over the engine. "I think maybe some people _can_ make friends with them."

Wulfgang glances back at Gerald, "Hey! Who are you slandering over there?" He is smiling like a bandit, and his tone suggests that he's nto mad. He does wander over, and stroke the enginge with a few fingers. It purrs, or at least, Wulfgang hears it purr...

Gerald's eyes widen in mock astonishment. "Slander? Perish the thought! I think you two make a lovely couple."

The gate seargent, Jens, snorts. "Why not? They've taught a kettle to make friends already." He points to 36, with a hint of awe in his voice. The soldiers here understand what the little shaman did for the Captain's daughter.

Wulfgang glares at Gerald, and mutters under his breath.

The expedition clears the rapids at the end of the second day. The river widens, though it still contains a lot of ice. The flat plains and even forests are replaced by rolling hills, valleys, and impressively dense old-growth forests. Jens hands a map-case to Fredric. "This is what we know," he says. "It isn't much. The river hasn't moved in a hundred years, but the people come and go. If there's any towns back here, they aren't part of the City, and they don't bother with signposts."

Shortly after breaking camp on the third morning, everyone notices oddities... noises in the brush, glimpses of something moving. "Someone is trying to shadow us," Fredric says.

Choi, normally unflappable, rolls his eyes. "An amateur," he adds, as a twig snaps nearby.

Wulfgang blinks and looks around. "Who would want to follow us? We're normal and unassuming..."

Wulfgang in particular, locks onto a particular bush. Wulfgang points it out, and starts to creep over to it. The shadower notes that suddenly everyone is quiet and looking around, and as Wulfgang takes a step to her bush, the Captain's Daughter bolts for it, running south, away from most of the company. Wulfgang breaks into a run. "Come on!" He shouts.

Gerald follows without hesitation. "Wait! Where are you going!" he calls to the retreating figure.

36 is slow, and knows it. But his gears whine and his pulleys tighten in some Newtonian approximation of determination, and he plods along behind them as best he's able.

Wulfgang calls out to Gerald, "Your way!" As he circles on the younder girl, chasing her in Geral's direction through the cold landscape, heavy footfalls found by all.

The girl doesn't answer or explain. Fortunately, she's about as good at running as she is at sneaking, and the boys easily catch up. Cassandra trips over a root and goes sprawling into the dirt and leaves. She rolls over and backs up against a tree, with a vicious look on her face. She's dressed in a 'borrowed' uniform that lacks insignia and which is slightly too large for her.

From where the boys are, they can see Choi circiling discretely behind the scene, maybe twenty yards off. If Cassandra runs in the same direction, she'll run right into him.

Gerald hesitates at her expression. "Wh... why did you follow us?" he asks, concerned. "What's the matter? Is something wrong?"

Wulfgang runs over to the girl. "Cassandra..." he calls out, as she backs over a tree, her name finally jogging out of his memory. He also tried to figure out how to explain to Choi that this isn't his fault.

Cassandra kicks at Wulfgang. "Where's the metal shaman?" she barks, voice quavering.

Steely resolve hasn't quite made up for brass joints, but 36 arrives and promptly wobbles to a stop. "I am here," he calls. "Miss Cassandra, what is wrong?"

Wulfgang , for his part, jumps back to avoid the kick.

Fredric keeps pace with 36, though he could clearly move faster. Cassandra sees that she's surrounded, and sits down heavily at the base of the tree. "It's gone?" she says quietly. "You don't have it anymore? Where did it go?"

"I spoke with the river," explains 36. "The herald is.. gone. To do no more mischief to you and yours, I hope. Please observe the taboo that I spoke of to your father, regarding the area in which you were found."

"It said it wasn't alone. It said there were more of it, coming from a vast wilderness." She shudders. "You freed me, but..." Her voice breaks. "I need to know for sure," she chokes out. "That they're gone."

"We're headed that way," Gerald says. "Have... have you met our Sphere? It seems to be Their natural rival. We were traveling to bring the sphere upriver. If there are any more of their kind... we'll probably encounter them on the way."

The metal man's voice quavers. "The river zaid.. that such thingz have come before, and that no great harm has been done. Miss Cassandra, the nightmarez it shared with you were itz dreams, but not necessarily reality." He reaches out a hand of forged steel, joints clicking. "It is a troubled spirit, and there are forcez on this river who are watching over your people."

"Gerald, may I have a word with you?" Fredric says suddenly. Then, quietly, "Are you mad? She was just exorcised and now she's run away! Think of what this is doing to her father!"

Wulfgang joins the conference. "Well, we could take her with us. It would be inconvienent to say the least, but at least we have the means to cure her. And it might make her feel safer. I admit it's not the best idea, but it is an solution."

Gerald blushes. "I... I know, sir. But what will we do? Do you think we should take her back? M-maybe we should."

Gerald then glances at the cart. "How'd she catch up with us anyway? Have we been going _that_ slow? She's on foot!"

Cassandra laughs, a short, sharp chortle. "You spent half the day stopped tending your machine! And you had a squad of soldiers in your way! A rabbit could have kept pace."

Wulfgang looks over to 36, "Well, we should at least have this conversation close to the boat, yes?" He starts to try and usher people in that direction, leaving Cassandra to 36, who seems to be the most trusted.

The girls stops, and look like she's thinking. "What did you do to it? Is it alive, like 36?"

Wulfgang blinks, "Well, yes. They're both alive, aren't they? THough, I'm not sure how it ended up with 36... You should probably ask him what happened to the Herald."

---

Cassandra makes it clear that she doesn't want to go back to Fort Hammer, not yet, anyway. Fredric has severe misgivings about not taking her back immediately. "She's been ill, she's only 16, and her father is a powerful man. To say nothing of the business with the Herald."

"She only run again," Choi says. "Better she be here."

"I thought your job was to keep the master's children out of trouble," Fredriec replies, somewhat sourly.

"You say there will be trouble?" Choi asks. "Some field trip!"

Wulfgang hrms. "I would feel better if this issue would have been sorted out at the Fort. We at least need to send a runner to tell her father where she is. I'm with Choi here. She's only going to come back, right? Havign her locked away in mortal fear in a tower is no better then when we found her."

Gerald scratches his head with a wrench. "Well, I don't know what to do about it, and that's a fact," he says. "Cassandra, you didn't happen to at least leave a note?"

Wulfgang says, "Also, how much trust do we think we can afford from the Fort Captain for the well being of his daughter."

"Yeah, I left a note," Cassandra says. "I said that I was heading south, to the City."

Choi grins. "Lady, we are very _north_."

"Well, that's going to be kind of awkward when we come back from the north with you," Gerald says, shaking his head. "But then again, I don't think any note would've made your dad worry any less."

At length 36 speaks up. "Miss Cassandra," he buzzes. "You muzt decide what you will do. Will you come with uz, return home, or do something else?"

Cassandra replies, "I'm going with you. Obviously."

The metal shaman nods. "Then az a condition of coming, I wish you to participate in a ritual tomorrow. I will inform your father of the truth and convey your wishez. Will you conzent to this?"

Wulfgang turns to 36. "You can do that?"

Cassandra looks a little confused. "Uh... sure."

36 bows his head. "Then I do not object. I will gather the required materialz and perform the work tomorrow evening."

Wulfgang turns to 36, "Does that mean we aren't moving until then?"

"We may continue. I think that walking and gathering iz at least as slow as a rabbit," replies the metal man.

"Huh. Magic," says Gerald, staring at his wrench.

36 says, "okay. one of you guys want to pose something along those lines for me?"

36 explains his requirements to the others. Certain materials and correspondences invoke invisible powers in useful ways, and the mechanical shaman wishes to make as much use of these as he can. He gathers together some of the spare parts from the boat and begins arranging them in piles, then begins tromping out into the wilds to see if he can locate certain plants and colors he needs.

Wulfgang listens to the stuff that 36 needs. "Hmm..." He thinks for a second,a nd is away in a flash. He comes back with both a sprind and a valve, to fulfill the downard pointing arrow. "Gerald, can we do anything blue?"

"Something blue? I've got just the thing," says Gerald. Many of the spare parts, both for the engine and for 36, are brass, but a few are unalloyed copper. "I kind of hate doing this..." he says, taking a few of the copper springs. "But if 36 says it will work..." And as he looks through the handful of books, trying to find a way to tarnish the outside of the springs a bright blue, he gets the inexplicable sense that 36 might be onto something.

36 gets some unexpected help from Fredric. "I've gotten pretty good as a sketch-artist," he says. "This is a bigger canvas than usual, but why not?" He prepares the markings on the ritual site.

Choi and Rodrigo keep an eye on Cassandra, who spends a lot of time sitting quietly near the crystal orb. "It likes us," she whispers more than once. "It's our ally."

The ritual starts as night falls. 36's ad-hoc medicine lodge is in a small clearing. 36, Cassandra, and an effigy of the Captain sit with backs to three large trees, making up the points on a roughly equilateral triangle.

Fredric watches from outside the circle, making notes with a quiet urgency. Choi, Wulfgang, and Gerald are invited to watch. Rodrigo stays with his raft. "I heard what you did for the last one," he says. "I'm just your drive. Call me when it's done."

That night, everyone has the same dream... or, at least, pieces of it.

In the dream, there's the Clearing, and the Boat, and the House. The House is the Captain's residence from the fort.

And there are other people... Alec, wandering in the no-man's land beyond the Clearing. He's looking for something.

The Sphere is present as well. It hovers over the raft, big as a man and glowing like the moon. Those who approach hear a thousand different whispering voices, most in unfamiliar languages.

Somewhere in the distance, there's a rumbling like thunder. The thunder seems to speak. 'I am the Herald,' it says. 'We are coming.' Cassandra, in her dream-form, trembles, but does not flee.

As the peal of thunder dies, Captain Teague steps out of the house.

"Father," she says. "I lied. I'm going north. I'm going to find the Herald's people."

Teague seems to realize what's going on. "It's a spirit, Cassandra. It's gone. It can't hurt you anymore. Please come home." There's a pain evident in his voice, especially when he catches sight Alec wandering beyond the circle.

"I need to do this," she says. "If it were Alec, or one of your men, you wouldn't tolerate cowardice!"

"I was wrong!" Teague shouts. Then, more quietly, "Come home. Please."

"When the job is done," Cassandra says softly.

Gerald steps forward, in the dream. "She's not alone, sir. We're here. And the metal shaman. And Choi and Frederic. And the sphere. We'll return her to you, safe and sound."

Teague wheels. "You lot," he says, without rancor. "I might have known. But... who is he?" Teague points to something behind Gerald, outside the clearing.

Everyone looks around. There's someone in the forest. A tall figure, cloaked and hooded in clothing of a familiar cut, but archaic somehow. There's a rising wind coming through the trees...

... and then you wake up.
