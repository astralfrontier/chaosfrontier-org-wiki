The following morning, Fredric, Choi, and Rodrigo gather in the boat's hut for a discussion of their unescorted minor. Nobody is suggesting that Cassandra is a retiring flower - quite the opposite seems to be true.

"Keep an eye on her?" Fredric cries, in response to some unheard comment. "Two eyes aren't enough for even Stentz and Linkletter! And a soldier's daughter isn't going to take orders from a naturalist!"

The conversation continues over breakfast. The students aren't discouraged from attending, but Fredric doesn't seem eager to solicit opinions just now. Choi is speaking more than ever before, playing the foil for the academic. "You afraid of little girl, or an old man? Or you afraid of losing paycheck," he asks. "Her father knows where she is. Noone say you kidnapper."

"No," Fredric grumbles, resignedly. "Just a corrupter of the youth." He dumps the dregs of his bowl overboard. "Well. Faster done, faster home. Mister Linkletter. Fire us up. The escarpment is still a week away."

"Yes sir," says Gerald enthusiastically. He's still inordinately proud of his creation, and loves to see it work... as slow as it is.

Cassandra, for her part, has been keeping to herself, wrapped in a wool blanket on the shore. When Wulfgang comes near, she asks, "Hey, what with the librarian? He not like girls?"

Wulfgang shrugs and grins. "Never asked. Maybe he just likes them older."

The geography of the river basin has changed from the flat fields around the City, to rolling hills, to increasingly dense forests. Old conifers and deciduous trees line the river and in places hang over the banks like the butresses of some great monument.

Near noon, when the sun is highest, 36 senses something from the crystal sphere. Gerald, in attending the mechanism, notices that the sphere hovers and spins much more often, somehow producing a gentle cushion of air between itself and its cradle.

"Sphere... how're you doing?" asks Gerald. "Are we getting close to something?"

The sphere buzzes back. It's not quite a voice, and not really words... more like a choir of bees.

The buzzing resolves into a series of pulses - a second on, a second off, as regular as a clock ticking. Wulfgang leaves the engine for a moment. "Hey, is he talking?"

Cassandra approaches as well. "Yes," she whispers. "I feel it. But it's not like the Herald... is it?"

"No. This is an enemy of the Herald. They had an argument, the night when 36 trapped the Herald," says the young Linkletter.

36 trundles over, and the now-familiar ritual is performed. The automaton sits down and falls limp; and the voice from his speaker-grill is a mixture of his own and someone else.

The sphere speaks. "Friends. I am troubled. And I am troubled that I am troubled. My kind are not given to worry."

Gerald grimaces. "Well, _that's_ not a good sign," he mumbles under his breath. Aloud: "What is it that troubles you?"

"That is the issue," it replies. "That I am capable of being troubled now. I do not think that it was possible before. Please tell me, in your own words, what transpired last night."

"We... had a dream ritual," says Gerald, trying to remember. "And toward the end, we had a vision of someone. I don't have any idea who it was, except I keep thinking I'd heard of him before, somehow..."

"I saw him as well," the sphere replies. "He tried to speak to me. I was unable to reply." The voice from 36's grill is accompanied by the clockwork buzzing from the sphere itself. "I am trying to learn that mode of communication."

"If he iz better at it than uz, and he iz interested in zpeaking with us," observes 36, "perhapz we can expect future communication."

"I find this thought troubling," the sphere replies. "I do not think that I am supposed to be able to perceive him."

"It iz good that this journey is a learning experienze for you as well then," says 36.

"Why not?" asks Gerald. "Why shouldn't you be able to perceive him?"

The sphere spins in its socket, throwing scintillations across the deck. "You say that you saw him in a dream. I do not dream, even as I do not feel fear." The sphere settles again. "The older man among you is reminiscent of the visitor. I have a request to make of him."

Fredric approaches. "Is it talking about me?"

"Yes," the sphere replies. "I need you to read to me."

Fredric kneels near the sphere and looks between it and 36. "Okay," he says slowly. "Why?"

"To learn to speak," it replies. "As you do.'

Fredric spends the afternoon reading to the sphere, mostly from his notebooks. His absence as a crewmember is filled by Cassandra, who seems to have learned how to handle a raft somewhere.

The voyage is not perfect. The engine and drivetrain are cantankerous and break down near evening. Inspection shows that it is merely inadequate lubrication, and easily repaired, but the day ends with the machine in a cold stop.

The next day goes much the same. The river is now surrounded by old-growth forests with hundred foot tall trees. The area is rich in the sound of birdsong and the rush of the river and the smell of old loam and leaves.

"I wonder... was it a coincidence that we found the Sphere when we did?" says Gerald, working on the drive train as Wulfgang buries himself in the engine itself. "Just in time for the Herald to come down from... wherever those things come from?"

Wulfgang leans back from his task, covered up to his elbows in coal-dust. "Dunno. Did they come from the same place?"

"It said it was the first of a legion," Cassandra adds, and shudders. She reaches for a blanket. "Cold out here," she mutters.

"Y'know, I don't know," replies Gerald. "I don't really remember _where_ the explorers found the sphere. It's just something that explorers brought back." He peers around, looking for Frederic.

Fredric is reading to the sphere from a volume of the University's famous Encyclopedia. "Though we know not the nature of the stars, many scholars believe that they are other suns, like our own, but so far away that they appear to the World as pinpricks of light in the sky..."

Gerald settles in to listen for a while. But it isn't long before he interrupts. "Frederic," he says. "Where did the explorers find our friend here?" He nods toward the sphere.

"Huh?" Fredric startles. "Oh. There's this fishing camp fifty miles from the City. It washed up on a beach, a few years ago. I thought it was a geode. They sold it to us for a case of whiskey."

As if in response, the sphere spins in its socket again. It looks distinctly... smug.

"So it's actually been around for a while. And it just didn't awaken until it saw the sun," says Gerald, musing. "We were just wondering," he says, gesturing toward the engine, "how it is that we came to meet the Herald going the other way."

Fredric closes the encyclopedia and steeples his fingers. "My guess... and it's only a guess, until we find some evidence... is that it got caught in a mudslide somewhere upriver. But that must have been hundreds, maybe even thousands of years ago. The Herald just got here last year."

"Azzuming that there iz a direct connection verges on superstition," points out 36.

Gerald purses his lips. "Based on _that_, yeah. I was just wondering if there was some reason. But it's starting to sound like it's just a coincidence."

36 crosses the boundaries of three worlds as he speaks further. "The impression I rezeive is... perhaps zimilar to if Professor Fredric had met an academic rival, one whom he had formerly had rather vigorous dealingz. I do not know how apt this comparizon truly is."

Fredric chuckles. "Surprisingly apt. There was that fellow in the Eastern empire, Dai Han. We never corresponded but he gave me a run for the copper... hmm." He taps the mirror assembly. "Maybe they serve the same purpose... but that implies that they were made by someone, doesn't it? And how could that be?"

"I waz made," points out 36.

Fredric seems to have no reply to that. Choi merely chuckles and relieves Rodrigo at the tiller.

On the morning of the next day, the expedition is now four days upstream from Fort Hammer. It's twice as far from the fort as the fort is from the city, and an odd place to spot boards floating downstream. They were clearly worked with axes and planers, and some are lashed together like decking.

With the gear aboard the vessel, 36 has little difficulty in securing a line on the wreckage. With his implacable physical strength, he starts to bring it aboard, watching carefully the seams and weaknesses of the crude structure.

Rodrigo watches. "Make him waterproof, and you could own the boatyards around town," he comments.

Gerald lays out the planks on the deck and tries to study them. "It's fairly primitive construction. Whoever built it had an axe, but not a saw. This side," he says, turning one plank over, "must've been facing the sun. I'd guess whatever this was, was about... oh..." He runs a finger along the edge. "Three years old, I'd say."

Wulfgang has a look. "Axes are easy to forge. Saws less so." He looks upstream. "Primitives?"

Fredric flips through the same volume of the encyclopedia that he was previously reading aloud. "Nobody's ever run into anyone up here. But then... nobody has been up here."

A fork in the river approaches. The right fork seems larger; however, according to the notes from Lord Tys' historical expedition, they went left.

"Thiz did not come from our route," announces 36 after a moment. "But from the other direction."

"What do you mean?" asks Gerald, still distracted by the puzzle of the lumber strewn across the river.

Wulfgang draws in the throttle. The raft is holding the raft against the current, far short of the junction. "What's it going to be, lads?"

"Pleaze allow me zome time," announces 36, and carefully begins to scrape some algae, fungus, and other life from the wooden raft salvage that's been brought near. Presently he requests access to the encyclopedia from Fredric, and begins poring through it, studying his new acquisitions with patient interest.

Rodrigo beaches the raft on a spit of sand that has grown at the fork. Sensing that they'll be there a while, he sets to work with several fishing poles.

Fredric leans on a boathook and watches 36 work. "You know, lads, this is an interesting issue. He's seeking the source of this artifact by the natural growth it has gathered. The University has identified tens of thousands of distinct varieties of plants and animals. Put a drop of water under a microscope and you'll see thousands more, in fact, the miniature world seems richer than our own."

Choi speaks up. "Large assembles from tiny," he says. "Even I've heard this one."

"Yes," Fredric says. "But moreso... on six continents we've found six distinct family trees of individuals. It seems to indicate common descent from six separate origins. Six different families of plants, six different families of animals. Even six different families of microbes. But there's a better question we've never answered. I wonder if you can guess what it is."

"Are people common to all zix?" asks 36 absently.

Fredric seems surprised. "Why, yes, though I hadn't considered that, either. People are remarkably homogeneous. Very little local variety. Hmm... perhaps that means something as well..." He fishes a notebook out of his pocket and begins paging through it.

"Besides having people everywhere," Fredric mutters, "and the same people, at that... despite six separate origins, there are still plants and animals everywhere. Six totally different origins would mean six totally different kingdoms of life. When it comes to life other than man, this is more like the same two stories in six languages.

"So... it's strange enough that there are six separate families of life..." says Gerald slowly. "But... even stranger that they're still rather similar?"

"It is not so unusual," points out 36. "You have dreamt for yourzelvez only one dream." He holds up a fragment of fern. "I believe that thiz came from the plateau which iz our ultimate deztination. I believe that both forkz will take uz to our goal. In the zpirit of the University, I am compelled to suggest that we explore the fork not taken and enrich ourzelves thereby."

"I'm inclined to agree," Gerald said. "But in my case, it's because someone built this thing, and now it's wrecked. Whoever built it is either in trouble, or beyond it. Either way, we should help them." He nudges one of the recovered boards with his foot.

Fredric nods, distracted by a new thought. "Very well. Go boldly where we've never been."
