Twilight lasts a long time at the rustic farmstead; it's still light enough to see, though Fredric's pocket watch shows that it's after eight o'clock. A few neighbors from nearby farms come to see the outsiders; most seem more curious than suspicious. The matrons and children are leading animals back to the barn. Wil and Cain negotiate with Fredric for basic supplies - preserved food, and spare clothes for Cassandra. Her leathers and wools are undyed and homespun but very durable - like the people.

Cassandra comments on her new clothes during the walk to the barge, when the villagers are well out of earshot. "I'm not ungrateful, but these are rather... coarse. I'm going to look like a Barbarian Princess from one of the southern islands."

"They are.. practical," buzzes 36, clicking his hands together thoughtfully as he trundles along. "Thiz iz the reality of our journey."

Wulfgang shrugs as he lazily peers off at Cassandra looking over the rustic clothing, "Did you really get much nicer things at the base?"

Cassandra smirks. "Father insisted that I learn how to act the part of a proper lady. Every Thawing - save the last - Aunt Julia would always bring finery from the City, for the wives and daughters at the Fort. We'd spend a month learning to wear them." She frowns. "I suppose I've outgrown them all by now, after being ill for so long."

Gerald chews on his lip. "Well... what's wrong with a barbarian princess anyway?" he says, trying to grin.

Fredric suddenly laughs; it comes out as an explosive snort. "That, Mister Linkletter, is what we call a 'loaded question'. We shall have to arrange for you to meet one."

It's dark when the explorers arrive back at the barge - too dark to move on. Rodrigo is still awake and tending a large bucket of freshly-caught fish. "Hunh. Guess they weren't cannibals after all," he says, and retires for the night.

Wulfgang, Cassandra, Gerald, and 36 all awaken later that night at the same time... or it seems like a waking. The stars, the few that were visible through the sky, have been replaced with a suffuse gray light. Though no brighter than starlight, nothing seems to cast a shadow.

Something that might be the crystal sphere is floating on the shore, where the old hunter's camp was. It shines like a cloud of stars itself, and makes a sound somewhere between a human humming tunelessly, and a machine spinning its gears.

The adults - Rodrigo, Fredric, and Choi - are still asleep. Fredric is snoring rather loudly.

Gerald glances at the others, then at the sphere. "That's weird. The sphere's normally quiet at night..." he murmurs, softly... not entirely sure exactly who, or what, he doesn't want to awaken.

Wulfgang walks to the edge of the boat, and looks out into the hunter's camp. He listens to the while of the gears.

The water beneath the boat is smooth and still as glass. Cassandra puts a hand in; the water yields, but her arm comes out dry. "We must be dreaming," she says, a bit loudly. "But... I'm used to such dreams having monsters."

Wulfgang looks over at Cassandra, "Maybe you shouldn't speak so loudly."

Gerald turns. "Indeed. But perhaps it's too late anyway." His hand moves to his side, where he keeps his pistol... then moves away. Whatever it is he senses, he doesn't feel anything threatening... yet.

Wulfgang blinks, and turns to his companions... "Who is he waiting for... 36?"

36 rises to his feet unsteadily, then clanks toward the others. "It is a dream," he says softly, and reaches up to touch a hidden catch on the featureless plate of his 'face'. The panel which covers his head hinges open into two halves, revealing a slightly luminescent face as detailed as a man's, but constructed of iron and rivets. The mouth moves in perfect articulation as he speaks again. "I think he is waiting for that which I also seek."

Gerald blinks at 36, bemused by his face... and for that matter, for the lack of the clockwork buzz in his voice. "Is that you, 36?"

"It is my dream," the clockwork creature answers with a smile, looking sidelong at Gerald. "Slowly it is starting to come true."

Cassandra is walking slowly towards the shore. "Fellows... I want to see this. Monster or not." She hesitates at the dock. "And not alone, if you'd oblige."

"We have been brought here too. It is not meant for you to be alone," smiles 36.

On the shore, the orb brightens and rises into the air, now floating twice as high as a man. Without seeing anything, everyone knows that something is about to arrive - something coming from the far north.

The orb is floating directly over the fire-ring that was discovered earlier. In this dream-world, the ring is whole again, and surrounds a smooth layer of ash. The orb continues to hum, though to human ears it is unintelligible.

"To whom do you speak," asks 36 unexpectedly.

The sphere replies; and the answer is clear enough for all. "I do not know. It has the voice of family but is unknown to me."

Wulfgang smiles, "Family sometimes shows up at the worst of times, eh?"

"Or the best of times," Gerald comments, looking north. "Are you the sphere we've been traveling with?"

Something approaches from upriver. It moves through the air halfway between the surface of the water and the overarching boughs of the high trees. It seems to be shaped like a man, and it slows as it approaches, though it is still moving far faster than any bird or boat.

"I have been travelling with you," the sphere replies. "This one has not."

Wulfgang says, "Has this one identified himself to you?"

"No. And I wish that it would." The sphere floats to the shore to meet the figure. Though both are a good ten feet in the air, it's easy to see - the approaching figure, dressed in black, is the 'tall man' seen during the last seance.

The Tall Man and the Sphere 'speak' to each other in the humming, whirring language. The man's eyes are constantly in motion, and don't seem to fixate on anything nearby; his face is otherwise expressionless, and his lips don't move.

Wulfgang turns to 36 first, and arches an eyebrow, "You have any more luck understanding this than us?"

"Were you Lord Renforth Tys?" asks 36, looking up at the tall man.

The tall man's eyes fix on 36 for a moment, and he is silent. Then he resumes talking to the sphere.

Experiment 36 has been at the university longer than almost any other living thing; steeped in its history, he draws on the well of memory and his studies of the books detailing the Lord's upriver expedition - those studies which led him into Bandwul's office on that fateful day. Now his face clicks and grinds, sections of the metal skin sliding about and assuming new forms. Old companions and associates, long gone. "Lord Tys would know me," he says, in voice after voice after voice. "Do you know me?"

The conversation between the Tall Man and the sphere has become increasing noisy. Without knowing how, everyone can tell that the sphere is 'agitated.' As 36 speaks, the Tall Man looks down at the small brass figure... and finally, you suppose, sees what is before him. "You," he says, and his lips form the words in a human voice...

Gerald steps up beside 36. He has nothing to say, yet - this Tall Man would have no cause to recognize him - except that he stands by 36 and will support him.

Wulfgang is standing upright as well, but makes no real move. He watches for more words...

In a flash of bright light, the forest clearing is replaced by a green lawn surrounded by stone buildings. There's a sundial that casts no shadow; the sun is bright overhead. The walls around the courtyard are immediately familiar - this is the University; though several of the buildings are missing.

Wulfgang blinks, and looks around... "Maybe the Tall Man wants to come back with us?" He watches the brief scene. "A lot has changed, however."

"We are seeing an ancient dream, once lost," whispers 36.

Another flash. Everyone is still standing where they were, but the buildings and walls are gone, and so are the trees... the new place is a vast, flat plateau. Everything is covered in tough vegitation, which seems a mix of ferns and scrubby bushes... but the colors are all wrong. There's too much orange and purple, and almost no green. The air tastes foul and the ground is spongy underfoot. The Tall Man has turned away, and faces... somewhere else. Northwest, perhaps, if the sun is to the south.

Gerald looks at Cassandra, unnerved by the brief experience of desolation.. "Was that... familiar?" he asks. "What the Herald showed you, I mean."

Cassandra has sunk to her knees, and wrapped her arms around her body. She's shut her eyes tightly, and only nods in response.

Wulfgang raises an eyebrow and looks to Cassandra.

Gerald kneels beside Cassandra and puts a hand on her shoulder, then looks up at the Tall Man once more. He would ask a question, but he does not yet know what he doesn't know.

The tall man still faces away. There's another bright flash. Still outdoors, and still in wilderness, but at least the vegitation here is green and the water blue. The area is a flat clearing the size of several city blocks, surrounded by rolling hills. A river - perhaps even the same river - flows from the north and winds its way southward. The soil underfoot is sandy. There's a large pond in the center of the valley. In the center of the pond, a stubby stone obelisk sticks straight up out of the water, about ten feet high.

The flash of light seems to penetrate even shut eyes; Cassandra clings to Gerald with a desperate, animal strength.

The sphere glows more brightly, and emits a shrill, high whine. "This is home! First of Six!"

Gerald feels himself begin to blush, glancing down at Cassandra, but the new circumstances draw his attention. "This looks... rather peaceful," he says to the sphere. "It _looks_ like the sort of place you belong."

The tall man turns, jerkily, and faces everyone. His face is drawn and pale. "I have been here for some time," he says; his accent is that of the City, but archaic and unfamiliar. "I... think that I may have... died here..."

"We will be there soon," Gerald says. "In the waking world, with the sphere. Perhaps when we arrive, we may learn something that will help you."

36 extends one of his mechanical gripping hands. Numerous devices and levers begin unfolding around the hand, pulling away the basic paneling, refining it into a suitable imitation of a human hand graved out of metal. "Come," he says. "I will show you something."

The tall man wraps one arm around himself, holds out the other to 36. The sphere buzzes away, examining nearby plants, rocks, and particularly the obelisk.

36 guides the Tall Man, beckoning to the others with his other hand, and walks to the edge of the water. "You are safe with us here," he murmurs. "Look down, and tell me what you see. There, in the water."

The old man looks down, and sees his own face - or his face as it is in portraits hung around the University. "Yes," he says. "That was me. I came to this place... twice. The second time, I did not leave it." He looks at the others. "You," to the boys. "Students. Still there are students. And the girl?"

"We will do our best to enroll her," murmurs 36, sounding slightly embarrassed.

"We have more to do before then," says Gerald. "We must learn of the desolation you showed us, and how it may be prevented or restrained. This is not the first of her dreams that it has haunted, nor will it be the last, I fear."

Cassandra refuses to rise. "I'm an officer's daughter," she says. "An officer's daughter." She says it twice; she's probably been saying it to herself repeatedly since the vision of the horrid weeds.

Wulfgang looks on at the task force. "We must stop that from happening...."

The old Lord nods. "There is a threat, and it is no dream." His speech sounds strained. "I made two trips to this place. Since the second, I cannot linger long elsewhere. Come to me." He takes his hand back from 36, and wraps both arms around himself. "Come to this place..." He sinks to his knees and seems to dissolve into a cloud of dust; the cloud is quickly driven away by a wind nobody feels.

Smiling, the metal man's face then turns to look at the others. "I was right," he says. "And for this, you must do something very important for me. You must remember this dream."

Gerald nods to 36. "I will cling to it. I keep a sketchpad by my bed. I will take notes." He looks down at Cassandra. "If you intended to purge your nightmare by coming along with us, your instincts were correct. We are going in the right direction."

Moments later, the valley, the pool, and the obelisk are also blown away like dust; leaving something cold and wet...

Gerald awakens to something confining and cold... a light, cold rain pours down through the narrow band of sky between the tall trees. Cassandra's arms are wrapped around his shoulders with every bit of desperation she showed in the dream. Nobody else seems to have moved.

Gerald blushes anew, but reaches under his bedroll with a free arm for his sketchpad and pencil... trying not to disturb Cassandra as he does so... and then freezes. "Who's there?" he whispers to an unseen presence.

Wulfgang looks around the sleeping quarters, smiles at Gerald.

Gerald coughs nervously, and carefully disentangles himself from Cassandra. "You had a dream in the night," he says emphatically, finally fishing out his sketchpad. "Tell me about it." He begins to scribble notes of his own, about the Tall Man, and the desolation... and about the sensation he had of something visiting him.

Wulfgang looks between Gerald, and Cassandra, then srugs, beginnign to recount what he saw in the dream to Gerald.

Eventually 36 regains consciousness as well. After a few minutes of quiet conversation with the sphere, one thing is clear: he has no memory at all of what went on. But he's patient and amiable and willing to listen to the story that he is told, and relays to the others that the sphere now has a precise location to which the party can be guided.

The interview with Gerald helps him put together a coherent account of the dream and its events committed to paper. He manages to include some sketches of the desolate landscape, but they are crude, at best - he is a better draftsman than an artist. At most, he manages to capture the colors of the discolored vegetation, but the shapes of them are hardly better than a child's painting.

Cassandra releases Gerald only reluctantly. She seems relieved to be awake, but still very frightened. She refuses to go back to sleep and takes shelter from the rain in an empty crate, with a lantern and her shortsword close by.

---

Fredric, Rodrigo, and Choi don't remember their dreams. The barge is underway before Fredric asks why his young charges are in such a state, and listens patiently are the tale is told.

The next several days are without incident. The barge continues along the branch of the river, through the dense old forests. Cassandra eventually relaxes, and her demeanor returns to a mix of lady and soldier. Rodrigo seems disturbed by the tale of the visitation. Choi betrays no signs, but is even more laconic than usual.

One day while working on lunch, Fredric breaks a long silence by saying, "Oh, that damn old goat! Once you give tenure to an academic, you can never get rid of him!" And then, more quietly, "If he is back from the grave, I'd love to see him take on Bandwul."

Gerald is, oddly, more upbeat than usual. Sure, he's had a disturbing and horrifying vision, but he's _also_ been shown that there's something productive he can do about it. Not only to continue the journey to the sphere's home, but... as he works on the daily maintenance for the sphere's solar cradle, he speaks up. "I was raised in the ways of science, First of Six," he says, without preamble. "But I've had this strange sense that none of the science I've learned can explain. And lately... well, I think it's more urgent than ever that I learn something about it."

The young mechanic looks straight at the crystal. "Like 36, you're something other than human. And, I think, in touch with these forces I can see but don't understand. What can I do to learn more? Where should I begin?"

The sphere buzzes and spins in its cradle; the sounds it makes sound a little more like human speech than usual. Gerald receives, without hearing, one crystal-clear thought from the exchange: _A mind is a knot in the tapestry of reality._ It's unclear if it came from the Sphere, or from within Gerald through some unknown channel.

Wulfgang puzzles to himself in a corner as Gerald speaks to thoe who will listen.

"And a gnomic utterance is a mixed metaphor," Gerald mutters - his literal mind can't get away from the idea that a tapestry is usually a _painted_ scene. But the metaphor is clear enough. "If a mind is a knot," he continues, less cynically, "then by its nature it can catch and tangle on the threads around it. It only remains to learn the mechanism of the loom, and the texture of the threads.."

---

The river flows on, and becomes narrower and more shallow. The trees also become smaller, and more sparse. After a few days, the dense old forest has given way to grasslands laced with streams, creeks, and smaller rivers. The barge does just fine on the larger branch, but must take advantage of its wheeled mode of travel more often.

As the forest thins, the Escarpment becomes visible. It's a cliff, nearly vertical and in places two hundred feet high, that divides the river valley from a high mesa. The Tys expedition first explored this mesa a hundred years ago, although from a different direction. The sphere, speaking through 36, confirms that the First of Six Points is somewhere in its interior.

In one wide area, the cliffs have given way to subsidence and mudslides. It is much as Wil described - a series of low hills, piled on each other, that ascend the cliffs like a giant staircase. From a distance, at least, they look trafficable; ascending to the mesa in the rolling barge will be more time-consuming than it is difficult.

"The zoil is rich with minerals and earth," observes 36, studying the plants. "There iz almost a boundary of zorts. Two rival kingdoms of life face off at this place."

"How's our water supply?" asks Gerald, raising his head from the stream in which the barge is currently floating. "This stuff doesn't taste very wholesome."

Wulfgang points to the steam motor powering the ATV barge, "I think we have our own water purifier.. if we need it..."

"I've been noticing that," Fredric says. "And other things. Look at the escarpment." He points. "You see that, where it's exposed? That band, near the top, is a different color. Everything below it is... different..." He trails off. "What it means is, there was a shake-up in the nature of things here. In the geological time scale, it wasn't that long ago. Though I can't tell when from this distance."

Cassandra stares at the puffing, wheezing steam engine. "Can we really get fresh water out of that?" she asks. "It doesn't seem very clean."

Wulfgang grins widely at Cassandra, "Steam is the purest form of water. We would just need to collect it..." He shrugs, looking back at the escarpment. "So someone or something put this here?"

Fredric shakes his head. "I don't know. The hand of nature is blind. Or it's supposed to be. Most things you see in geography are just... wind and rain, earth and air, piling up. After these last few weeks?" The professor rubs his chin. "Someone's playing silly buggers," he mutters.
