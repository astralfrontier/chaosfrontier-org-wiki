The great winged monster disappeared into the sky, and the herd of running beasts thunders off into the distance. The explorers are left alone, for a time, with only the background noise of a light wind, and reddish plants rustling in it. Fredric leads the expedition a few miles from the encounter site, then calls for an early halt. "If this offal makes us smell less like food, then moving aware is safer," he explains; "and if it makes us smell more like food... well... moving away is only wise. We should find out which case we're in; our survival depends on it."

Once again, the stout clockwork creature called 36 beckons for Cassandra's aid and presence. This time, however, there is much less of a ceremony; a few minutes suffice to create a suitable ritual space, and no items of occult significance are called for. The journey upriver seems to have given him a greater surety of technique.

What he proposes is simple: to reach out to the mind of Cassandra's father as he sleeps, walking the paths of the dream world and guided by the pharos of the man's true name and the bond of kinship with Cassandra, whom 36 has at his disposal for the ritual. What he proposes to _say_ is equally simple: beware the red life, and why, and finally an exhortation to seek out the area where Cassandra was found unconscious to see if there is more to be found there.

The plateau cools at night, and the sky is cloudless under a full moon. With no city lights to spoil night vision, one can see almost as well as during the day. The explorers sleep, and share a dream...

The blue and silver light of moon and stars deepens and lengthens, taking on a reddish caste. Soon, the whole plateau is glowing a soft red; the wind is replaced with whispers... the voices of the other things that sleep here.

The whispers express the most simplistic thoughts. 'Light.' 'Food.' ''Rain.' 'Growth.' The surrounding plain is full of brighter spots of red, and from these come more whispers: 'Intruder.' 'Follow.' 'Seek.' Somewhere in it all, distant voices mutter complicated but recognizable thoughts. 'Hunt. Observe. Isolate.'

The explorers are one island of green, glowing dimly in a sea of red. Dead ahead however, there's a beacon of blue-white light, like the distant glow of a city. A gentler blue-white haze leads forward from the barge, towards the beacon... and leading away behind the barge, a blue-green haze that becomes insubstantial long before reaching the horizon.

Nevertheless, it is this blue-green haze that carries the message. For a moment, the distant Fort Hammer is as close as the next hill. Cassandra's father sleeps uneasily, and stirs when he receives the message: _Beware the red life._ The more complicated parts of the message are less clear; though after some minutes 36 is sure the intent has been transmitted.

And there's more than one recipient. The dreamers become aware that the blue glow ahead is joined to the Fort by the River that brought them here; and the River joins one other... Alec, Cassandra's brother. In a sea of murmurs, one message comes back clearly: _I will return to Father. I will explain._

---

The sun rises, and a new day begins. The dewlike substance dropped by the flying creature has dried to a tough, rubbery substance. In place it has eaten pits into the wooden fixtures of the barge, though not enough to compromise its structure.

Wulfgang digs into the cabin, and pulls out the spare wood, mumbling as he sets about fixing the holes that the dew substance has eaten into the wood. "How nice. Rain like acid."

Fredric watches Wulfgang at work. "But does it hide our scent, I wonder? In either case, if that substance destroys the barge..." he doesn't finish the thought, but looks worred.

Wulfgang nods at Fredric, "Best to get it up and off now, then, with some fresh lumber. Of course, if we stick around too long I'm sure we'll run out..."

Fredric considers. "Alright. Never mind the scent, then. Full speed ahead. We need to get through this place, as fast as we can."

---

The landscape becomes more exotic as the day progresses. The alien 'trees', which once appeared as spare singletons, appear in clumps. Dust clouds on the horizon show where packs of the hunting animals are moving, and their distant shrieks and cries show their agitation. But none approach too close to the barge. The brushlike undergrowth now varies in thickness from a few inches to a few feet, and the explorers must carefully pick their path around groves and hillocks.

Gerald takes frequent glances behind the barge, as if to watch for what is following. At one point, he rubs his eyes. "Uh. Guys, that's weird. Is it just me, or is that grove getting taller? Or... higher?" He points.

Wulfgang looks up and over from where he is tending the engine, his eyes squinting to make out whatever Gerald is referencing...

Feeling the spiritual as well as physical world churning nearby, 36 calls out in a silent invitation. _Come and speak to me. You have no need to hunt or to fear us._

Most of the nearby spirits avoid the call... the weaker are merely oblivious; a few of the stronger, actually recoil. Only one comes forward. 36 recognizes its type, if not the individual. And so does Cassandra. She quickly draws her oversized shortsword, and hisses angrily. "It's _him._"

Wulfgang looks over at Cassandra, watching the two, "It's... who exactly?" He asks, getting to his fead, his hand on his stick.

"It iz not the Herald, but zomething akin," explains 36 slowly. _We come wishing to help you,_ he calls to the presence. _Will you speak?_

A voice grates in 36's mind. "We come for you. We challenge your usurpation. We bring the new world."

_We come with one called the First of Six. You are the spirit of this land, are you not? The gods of this red ecology?_ 36 asks

The crystal orb vibrates within its cradle of mirrors. Its contribution is speech only in a primitive sense. _We oppose. We resist. You must not return._

The Herald answers 36, and speaks in the brass man's voice. Cassandra's grip on her sword tightens. "Red ecology. Yes. We are that. We are this place."

36 pauses for a moment. "All muzt be heard," he says aloud. "All muzt have a say. There is another way. Is there a leader or chief among you, one who speaks for all?"

The Herald takes some time to answer. 36 can here confusion rippling among the local spirits. "There are only one of us," it finally replies.

"Do I underztand then..." 36 pauses in turn. "That all speak for all? Zo then.. give uz some time to prepare, and we will zpeak to all of you. There iz a way. You need not be shut out. You may live, and grow, and spread - after a fashion. Will you hear uz in due course?"

Two competing currents ripple through the surrounding spirits. The agitation extends into the physical world, as well; the alien vegetation creeps higher on either side of the barge, turning the path into a kind of ditch. The raft shakes as the vegetation retreats. It's so thorough that nothing living is left beneath the barge; the path ahead is now over bare dirt.

The crystal sphere lifts out of its socket and floats at eye level. It buzzes loudly and glitters with an internal light. "We crushed you before," it shouts at the Herald. "We can crush you again, if you threaten life!"

"You threaten itz life, do you not?" asks 36 calmly. "Did you not confine it - seal it away - yourzelvez?"

The sphere dims, floats lower. If it's possible for a featureless crystal to look chastened... "It was our purpose. We could do nothing else."

The Herald growls. "Sealed we were. Speak all you like. We will not go be buried again beneath sea and stone."

36 hums and grinds, a gear in his torso ticking loudly for a few moments. He addresses himself to the presence of the red life. "We will zpeak zoon. For now, thank you for the peace you have offered uz."

Wulfgang looks over at 36 as he whirrs. "THat sounds either really good, or really bad. I can't really decide which..." His stick is still at the ready, standing by Cassandra and her sword.

"You muzt decide, Mr. Wulfgang. I will explain shortly," says 36.

Cassandra snorts. "You speak of peace with such monsters?" She turns from 36 and glares out over edge of the barge, at the living mass beyond. "Have you noticed that they've walled us in?"

Gerald's hand rests on the mirror-cradle, and he looks off into space. "If we're so thoroughly surrounded... _can_ we even fight, with the weapons we have? No, we must cling to what peace we can..." In his heart, though, he thinks another thought. _Or else... we must find new weapons._ And he thinks of the strange sensations he's experienced with machinery at the University... and in new contexts, on this journey.

Wulfgang looks at Cassandra, then in some surprise at Gerald. "Peace should always be sought. Even dignitaries that fight wars, more or less, desire peace. Perhaps peace on their terms. But peace none the less." He looks over at the things, and at the orb,

The alien life has now crept back from the barge's track, some twenty feet on either side. Though the living mass is mostly still, its surface sometimes contorts and heaves, as if someone had disturbed the mud of a stagnant pond. The barge is idle with its wheels on bare dirt, in a kind of ditch some forty feet across and twelve deep. The ditch leads ahead in much the same way that the expedition was already travelling. The path behind is considerably narrower, and disappears behind the last turn the barge made to avoid a grove.

"There iz more we muzt learn," announces 36, both to whatever spirits are still present and to his companions - and to the First of Six. "We muzt learn the hiztory of this, for it has been forgotten by zome. Emissaries of the red life, will you meet with uz at our camp when the next dawn comes?"

"For until then, it iz important that we reach our deztination."

Nothing replies, though the noise of the surrounding spirits rise and fall, apparently in some internal dispute. The red walls remain, apparently pointing the way towards the valley that is the expedition's goal.

Wulfgang wanders over to the Steam engine, and fires it back up, to get what we increasingly inacruately call a barge moving again.

The crystal sphere rotates. Its dim glow is visible even in direct sunlight, scintillating as only diamond can. "We had a plan," it says. "Thought I no longer know that plan. Only the consequences."

"That iz one thing we muzt discover," says 36 softly.

The sphere sinks back into its socket. "Home is within two sunsets. Take me there."

---

As the barge rumbles on, the metal shaman explains his proposal to the others.

"Professor Fredric. I believe the Univerzity would be interezted in the red life here. Am I correct?"

Fredric's lips press into a thin line. "Yes," he says. "Though I'd fear to bring it to the menagerie."

36 continues. "Cazzandra. There are presencez on the plateau that you perceive but may not underztand. Further, you are still in advance of your father and the fort in thiz regard. You carry a zword against an ezzentially zpiritual opponent. Humanz need a more .. zubstantial way to interact with what iz beyond. Do you agree?"

Cassandra shrugs, looking quite petulant, and more girlish than usual because of it. "As Gerald pointed out, we fight with the weapons we have. Whether anybody likes it or not."

"And finally..." 36 turns now to Wulfgang. "Mr. Wulfgang. There have been timez that I have felt fear, and surprize, and other thingz which I did not reveal. But.. I have zeen it in your eyes. You are not zensitive to zpiritz. Unless.. zo encased in metal. You know buziness and dealings and the world of man, but I do not. So, in our dealingz... I will channel the red life's godz, and you muzt negotiate with them."

Wulfgang perks up an eyebrow at 36. "Oh?" He gets all flustered a bit, and stammers, "I..." Then he regains control, and looks 36 back in the eye, smiling, "I'm sure this will be acceptable, at least in some fashion, yes." He ponders, though. I can feel how machines themselves are doing. What if there's a ghost in it...

"You will zuffice," says 36 quietly. "Zo.. Here iz truth. Life iz not good or evil in itzelf. Life wishes to live. Weedz do not care if the gardener will pluck them up. They grow regardless. The red life iz the same, I believe. I wish to give it a place in thiz world. The living thingz will be of interest to others. As for the spiritz.. they may walk among men in the zame way as I."

He turns to Gerald. "If you can unlock the myzteriez of my animation, that is. Can you do it?"

Gerald taps his chin with a screwdriver. "I don't know," he says. "I mean... I believe I understand how your _mechanical_ parts function, but as to what drives them - the _you_ that drives them - I don't have a clue..." He trails off. "No. No, that's not true. This journey has forced me to acknowledge that I have senses beyond the five we record in the University biology books. If I can learn how to use them..." He nods firmly to 36. "I can't right now. But I will."

"Then thiz is what we will propose." 36 turns his attention now to First of Six. "The red life will not grow unchecked. But it muzt have a place - unlezz you can remember why not. There iz also a place for the green life. There muzt be a place for all life. Spirit and mortal. Red and green. Will you help us?"

The crystal being rattles in its socket. "I do only what I am meant to. Bring me home," it says, "and we shall see."

The barge rumbles on, making better time over smooth ground. The red life keeps to either side, always restless and often erupting. Nothing more is heard from the Herald, or First of Six, for the rest of the day, but sometimes the explorers can hear red animals moving in herds, not that far away.

By the time night falls, the red banks have risen to nearly twenty feet on either side, and the sky is tinged with a red glow in every direction save one. Straight ahead, the setting sun shows the first shred of blue horizon that anyone has seen in days. It's visible for only a few minutes, and then it's gone, leaving a night full of rustling, yipping, and growling beyond the high walls.

---

The 'red life' is still keeping its distance when morning comes. The rolling barge is on a strip of bare earth some fifty feet wide, between two living walls, each some twenty feet high. The walls wobble and pulsate as if breathing - which they almost certainly are - in contrast with the hard, sterile ground below. With the sky reduced to a dim, red-tinged band overhead, the sensation is reminiscent of the canopied tributaries of the great river... save that the land around, did not exude alien hostility.

Fredric orders the engine started, and the barge rolls on its way. There ground is devoid of plant life; in some places, bare stone shows through the sandy soil. The stone surfaces are uneven, but rounded and polished to a smooth, bonelike grey-white. The barge rolls roughly over it all, iron-bound wheels creaking on the hard ground.

Near noon, the channel abruptly ends. Behind the explorers, the plain of red life, with its low hills, fleshy trees, and batlike fliers, stretches away to the horizon. Before is a narrow expanse of grassy fields... sickly-looking and browned by drought and altitude, but ordinary grass nonetheless.

The barge soon crests a low rise, and looks down into a valley. Though none of the explorers have been here before, by now, they know it well - from dreams, visions, and literature.

The valley is roughly oval and surrounded by rolling hills. The valley floor is flat; from the top of the hill, it looks almost deliberately graded. There are many patches of alpine wildeflowers and a few evergreen trees. There is a wide, still lake in the center of the valley, with a stream leading away to the south. A dull roar from the south gives a sign that the stream may turn into a waterfall; these waters almost certainly feed the great river that brought everyone here.

The sky overhead, and to the south, is a familiar, cloudless blue, but it shades to purple and red in every other direction - especially to the southeast, towards the living plain of the red life.

Entering the valley was like having a weight lifted from Gerald's shoulders. "It's... beautiful," breathes a lad who thought he had little interest in the beauty of the natural world. _Perhaps you only realize what you have when it's taken away from you,_ he thinks.

"Why iz the air here zimilar to outside?" 36 asks after a moment, watching his companions inhale and exhale and studying their faces curiously.

Cassandra is torn between glaring back the way you've come, and staring eagerly - almost hungrily - down into the alpine valley. "The Herald hasn't come here," she answers confidently. "Even its breath is poison."

Gerald scratches his chin. "It's the plant life, I guess," he says. "Green plants... I don't know the details, but they use sunlight to gain sustenance from the air and give off gases that are fit for animals to breathe. I guess they clear the air in other ways, too." He looks over his shoulder. "At least, from our perspective. I suppose red plants - or rather, the growing-in-the-ground organisms - make the air fit for red life."

Fredric scans the valley with a spyglass. "The entangled skein," he murmurs. "All the processes of all the life of the world interwoven, in conflict and support at the same time. Those things... have their own skein, it seems." He straightens and focusses the spyglass in the center of the lake. "Oh... now what is that?"

Fredric points to something protruding from the center of the lake. It may be a small island, or a very large boulder, covered in moss and shrubs. In any case, reflected sunlight glints steadily from something at the very center.

Gerald grins. "That... must be our destination." He nods to First of Six. "Look familiar?" he asks the crystal orb.

The sphere buzzes. Even without 36 moderating, it's barely distinguishable as a single word: 'Home'.

Cassandra frowns. "So... we got it home." A pause wide enough for two breaths. "Now what do we do?"

"Now we zeek truth," answers 36, gears whirring softly.

It's easy enough to find a course to the valley floor, and then into the lake. It's not all that large, perhaps two miles from end to end, and it follows the shape of the valley.

Wulfgang looks over the lake, and looks around, "Is my life always going to be on the water?" He asks, of noone in particular. "I must admit, that the view is splendid, however."

The barge has been out of water for a long time, and the long and continued shocks of overland travel have taken their toll. There's many leaks, but it still holds water and easily remains afloat for the few minutes it takes to cross to the central island. The water is cold and exceptionally clear. Fredric lifts a handful to his mouth. "If you always sail in waters so pure, Master Wulfgang," the professor says, "you'll be lucky. We need to fill the drinking barrels with this stuff."

"Especially if we're going to have to recross the red plateau," Gerald points out. He grimaces at the water pooling at the base of the barge. "Definitely going to have to work on some kind of shock absorption for the wheels," he says, absently.

Wulfgang nods, and finds Choi, to help him go unhitch the barrels from the bardge, and start filling them with the clean water.

"Your other zelf iz waiting," says 36 to the sphere, pointing vaguely to the middle. He calls out silently, then waits for a response.

The sphere rises from its cradle to about head-height and wobbles shakily through the air, drifting towards the center of the island at about walking speed. Anyone who wishes can easily keep up with it; leading the pack is Fredric. "Uh... where is it going?" he tosses over his shoulder, more or less in 36's direction.

"Home, az he zaid," replies 36, as though this were obvious.

A moment later, the sphere suddenly surges upward and forward, and disappears as it rushes towards the center of the island. So fast does it depart that the air seems to burn its its wake, and a loud cracking noise splits the air.

Wulfgang watches with amazement as teh sphere dissapears. "Well.. that seems to be done now.. yes?" He smiles, and looks at his companions, his smile betraying the level of incorectness he knows about his statement.

"Not yet. Now we have to see what happens. Come on!" exclaims Gerald, breaking into a run in the sphere's wake.

The island isn't that large, and the sphere has not gone that far. The explorers catch up to it in the very center, where a grove of saplings makes almost a perfect circle. And in the center is the thing that you must have seen from the valley rim. The object is a transparent crystal obelisk, very similar in substance to the sphere. It is square in cross section and ten feet high, going from four feet wide at its base to about three at its squat pyramidal peak. The sphere is circling near this peak. Flashes of light come and go between the two crystalline objects.

Wulfgang looks over at 36, "So... what is it saying?"

"It iz reporting in," summarizes 36 after a moment. "It.. was on an expedition, like ourz perhapz."

Fredric seems about to touch the obelisk, but then thinks better of it and draws forth a magnifying glass. "If it's reporting in... who is it reporting to? What IS this thing?"

"It iz.. like the sphere," says the mechanical man after a moment's hesitation. "It has the zame.." His voice fuzzes out into incomprehensible static for a few moments.

Wulfgang points at the base of the obelisk, walking around and around the thing as he looks, more carefully near the bottom, "It seems like it goes.. down?" His eyes refocus and look at the thing, "I wonder how you get into it..."

Rodrigo, the boatman, sits quietly on the path back to the boat. Choi stands near Wulfgang, impassive and wary. Cassandra circles the obelisk, much like the sphere itself, though at a slower pace. "Did someone bury it?" she asks.

"First of Six says it's been a long time since it was home. Centuries? Maybe it was just buried by geology," says Gerald. He reaches down and digs into the soil around the base of the monument, examining it minutely.

Gerald's diggings confirm that the visible part of the obelisk is just part of something bigger. It also reveals that it's safe to touch the obelisk; brushing sand from its base doesn't seem to harm anyone or anything.

36 carefully settles himself down on the ground, in a compact hunched posture that's as close as he gets to kneeling, and waits.

Wulfgang reaches our and tenderly touches the oblelisk, and assumign he's not injured or something, starts to pulls his fingertips along the structure.

The obelisk is smooth to the touch, and feels much like the sphere. It's unexpectedly warm, especially where the sun shines on it. The edges are sharp, but not painfully so, and refract light in rainbow patterns. For those who know diamond from glass, the obelisk is definitely diamond - possibly the largest one ever seen.

Gerald looks straight up along the obelisk, shading his eyes. "36... is First of Six still... reporting in, or whatever?" he asks. "I don't want to interrupt anything, but I'd like to know if he'll introduce us."

"It iz energized," the shaman reports, studying his perceptions closely. "It iz .. impatient. It wishez entry. Perhapz to whatever the obelisk is, or what it guardz. It iz clear that there iz more here than just thiz."

"Is there anything we can do to help? Gerald asks in reply. "I'm guessing this obelisk has something to do with the island of green life here. If we're to have any hope against this invasion the Herald was threatening, we'll need its help. Even if we want to negotiate... we have nothing to negotiate _with_ if the red life can just take what it wants."

Cassandra frowns. "It hasn't taken this place," she hazards. "It isn't all-powerful."

Gerald nods to Cassandra. "Exactly."

36 cogitates. "A zubzidence," he concludes finally. "There waz more here but it haz now been buried."

"So... First of Six can't get in because the entrance is underground now?" asks Gerald.

36 nods slowly. "I believe zo."

"Then what are we waiting for?" asks Gerald, rushing back toward the barge. "Let's get some shovels!"

While Gerald acts, 36 approaches the obelisk. "We have brought your explorer here," he explains to the thing, hoping it can comprehend him fully. "We wish to know what transpired here. We wish the red and the green life to live peacefully together. Humans have the power to make this possible."

When the obelisk replies, it's in the buzzing speech that the sphere only just manages - but much louder. Nobody has any trouble understanding. "Nearly all humans had left, as was planned," it says. "We remained, to keep watch over operations, as was planned," it continues. "We were buried. This was not planned. However, it was not unexpected. We were no longer needed. And so... we have let operations proceed. That is what has transpired."

"Why was the red life sealed away?" 36 asks.

"It was planned," the obelisk buzzes enigmatically.

The sphere chimes in - literally. Its 'voice' has become somewhat more musical, more expressive, than the obelisk. "It doesn't understand," the Sphere says. "We know what. We no longer know why."

"Then.. planned by whom?" asks 36.

Both crystal entities reply at once. "Humans." The obelisk continues, "As you say. 'Humans have the power to make this possible.'"

"No humanz which the University has recordz of have yet accomplished creaturez like yourzelves. I am only an early prototype. Zo then, where can the humans who performed this feat be found?" 36 studies the obelisk carefully.

One can only assume that the obelisk and the sphere are conversing; the air is filled with buzzing; sporadic arcs of light, like miniature bolts of lightning, pass between the two as the sphere orbits the obelisk's peak.

The storm-in-miniature abruptly ceases. The sphere halts, and descends to head-height. It stops in front of Fredric's face. "There is another entrance in this valley," it chimes. "We must go there."

"Great," Fredric replies, startled. "Entrance to _what_?"
