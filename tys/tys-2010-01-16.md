The Lost City is home to many mysteries. The upper galleries, with machines of crystal and brass, to draw power from the sun. The sunken buildings, once home to a human civilization long lost and never recorded. The central spire, barely visible above ground, yet rooted in an underground lake of living water.

One mystery, it seems, has been solved: What happened to Lord Tys? His mortal remains appear entombed in the very crystal of the spire, over a hundred feet below ground. His second expedition ended here, or not far away. His body remains; perhaps his soul as well, in the dreams of these machines.

The explorers are at the bottom of the lost city, on the narrow, sunless shores of the underground lake. 36's experiment mingled his waters with those of the lake. The 36 that has tended the University's gardens seems to still inhabit the brass man, along with a new presence that comes and goes. The new presence has an understanding of this place and its purpose - to carry the seed of a habitable world to a lifeless one.

"Our goal was to find the origin of the crystal sphere," Fredric begins. "We've found that, and much more besides. Too much, perhaps. It will take a lifetime to sort through what's down here. And then there's the red life." A pause. "We need to go home soon."

Wulfgang glances at 36, then Cassandra, then Gerald, and finally back to Fredric. The youth is slient. Wulfgang, probably moreso then the rest of the group, has the urge to return to the hustle and bussle of the University.

"There _is_ too much here," Gerald agrees. "I'm going to have to spend some time back at home before I even _understand_ enough to start studying this place properly." He grins, and adds "Preferably with a full machine shop."

"With your permizzion, sir, I wizh to remain here. To explore, learn, and to communicate with the red life." 36 clicks his hands together. "Alzo, I am the logical choize. I will not run out of suppliez or air. And, Mr. Gerald has already helped me with another matter." He raises one arm, indicating a joint. "Thiz is my rotator cuff. You fixed it one day, and you have not had to repair it zince. I have notized that many other of my componentz have been modified during our maintenance sessions. You have improved me in wayz I do not yet underztand, but I believe I can zurvive longer without repairz now."

Fredric's face betrays a lack of comprehension. "First, it didn't occur to me that you can't survive on his own; and second, it didn't occur to me that you'd want to."

Wulfgang looks at 36. "You can't stay...."

36 points unsteadily to the lake. "Our anceztors incurred a great debt by the actionz they took," he explains solemnly. "Now a whole skein of life, as Professor Fredric has zaid, haz been displaced and punished. They were awakened to darkness and repression by thoze who came to thiz world. There iz an atonement that muzt be performed for this sin."

"It makes sense," Cassandra says. "Whatever else this place is, it's a watchtower against the Herald's people. Someone should be watching."

Wulfgang wraps an arm around the metal man, and looks, "You know, if anyone is going to atone for the sins of our... race... It's probably not your job, you realise..."

36 shakes his head. "This iz the duty of the shaman. Making humanz accept thiz is.. your duty, Mr. Wulfgang."

"All right then," Fredric says. "We're going back to the amphitheater. Mister Stentz... Mister Linkletter... do what you can to see that 36 is ready for the long-term. Cassandra, please help me forage for anything that might be edible. Also look for artifacts we can carry by hand. When that is done, we head for home."

Wulfgang discovers a cache of small tools on a workshop building. Discolorations on the floor show where larger machines once stood, leaving no hint as to their function. A box of wrenches is easy enough to understand, however, and these tools are in perfect condition.

After Gerald and Wulfgang's ministrations, the stock of spares for 36 is exhausted, and the little machine is running better than he ever has. A mechanism ready to wait out months in isolation and wilderness; a fitting occupant for the abandoned ancient outpost.

Cassandra and Fredric return when the work is finished. "Nothing in terms of cultural artifacts," Fredric says, "except for street signs and warnings. Most of them are secured to the walls with some unbreakable glue." He holds up on find: a flat, thin metal plate covered in letters of an unfamiliar script. "Probably just says 'No Smoking.'"

Everyone makes the long trip back to the surface to say their goodbyes. The expedition has been underground all day; the sun is fading in the west by the time anyone can taste fresh air again.

After an uneventful night, it's time to say goodbye. One of the crystal spheres will stay, and the original will continue to travel with the expedition. "I can tell the story in my own voice now," it buzzes. "You will be more easily believed."

Wulfgang looks at 36. still not really wanting to leave him behind. "You stay good. We'll be back..."

The metal man tilts his head slightly. "Good-bye, Mr. Wulfgang. Mr. Gerald. Ms. Cassandra. Professor Fredric." He raises a hand, then turns to be about his new business.

The boilers are fired and the engine clanks to life as the sun crests the hills to the east. Fredric directs the barge to head southwest - directly towards the city, and away from the plateau of the Red life. The sky is a clear, cloudless blue, and the high mountain air offers excellent visibility. At last sight, 36 is clanking his way gingerly down the access ladder and into the lost city.

The expedition is low on food and coal. A supply of 'winter cake' remains: dense chunks of honey, wheat flour, and candied fruit. There's more than enough to serve as rations for the rest of the trip, moreso because most people normally wouldn't consider eating it.

The rolling barge makes good time. Fredric spends most of his time with sextant and compass, and by luck or by design, he's picked a route that descends quickly without having to traverse any cliffs. On the third day, the barge picks up a creek that might be a high-mountain tributary of the Icy River.

---

On the sixth day, the barge reaches the Great Escarpment. Here, the Icy River is swift and deep, though only about six hundred feet wide. Rodrigo beaches the boat far upstream of the massive cataract. It's deceptively quiet - from here, the river gives no sign that it plunges a hundred and fifty feet to the valley below.

Fredric bends over his maps and charts. "Alright. From here we could just put the boat in the river and float on home. Could be a Lord's yachting trip, for all the work we won't have to do. There's just one problem." He stands and folds his sextant. "There's a gigantic waterfall in the way. Any ideas?"

Wulfgang looks around, "DOn't we stil have wheels? Surely there's a way to get down there over land..."

Gerald scratches his head. "That's a puzzler. I don't think we can just go straight down." He looks contemplatively at the river, as if envisioning the river. "I don't suppose we've got a hundred and fifty feet of rope that'll take the weight of the barge and everyone in it?"

"Well... as it happens..." Fredric points to a barrel. "I expected that we might have to climb _up_ this very escarpment, and there's three hundred feet of cotton cord rolled up in that. It wouldn't last on a ship but it's light and good for a mountaineering."

Gerald opens the barrel and lifts out a loop, examining it closely and tugging on it with both hands. "Somehow I don't know if we can expect to get all the way down in one go, but maybe I can do something with this..."

Wulfgang looks at Gerald, "Well, the only idea that comes to my mind is taking the boat apart and sending it down in pieces, then putting it back together. Which might take fractionally less time then finding a way around."

Wulfgang and Gerald get to work. Beams and planks from the barge itself are removed and assembled into a makeshift crane; the steam engine and drive train provide a means for powering the contraption. By the end of the second day, it's a fair imitation of the cargo cranes on the Duchy's docks. The third day is spent lowering the remaining lumber to the valley floor.

Nobody rides the crane; Fredric and Cassandra leave early in the morning and manage to bushwhack a path down the escarpment. Later, Choi and Wulfgang follow, leaving only Gerald and Rodrigo on the plateau.

Only one flaw is found in the plan: the steam engine can be lowered without power, but the rest of the crane can't lower itself. So the following day, the new barge is somewhat smaller than the original and less sound.

Rodrigo doesn't complain, much. Fredric pre-emptively hands over a check drawn on the University's accounts.

There is a great lake at the base of the waterfall, carved out of living rock by slow years. Far from the noise and clouds of spray, the rebuilt barge floats placidly. Fredric makes no attempt at field geology here. "After everything we've seen, the mere rocks and plants of the river seem... pedestrian."

---

The river plunges into the great old-growth forests that characterize the hinterlands of the Duchy's territory. After weeks on the high plateau, the world seems strangely dim, cool, and green. The following morning, Gerald awakens first, and is shocked to discover a seventh person sleeping in their camp.
