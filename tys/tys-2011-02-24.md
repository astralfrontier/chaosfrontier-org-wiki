> (OOC) TysGM says, "So their leader will be an old boatman who's promoted himself to a desk, regretfully. Want me to set it up?"

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Naw, I got it half done anyway. I was going to do furious writing while Gerald or Alex was going with something that needed more interaction."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Fire away, then."

> (OOC) Wulfgang will be just a bit more, honestly. I've only got a couple of paragraphs done.

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "At least this part I kind of have an Idea how I want it to goes."

> (OOC) TysGM kk

> (OOC) TysGM says, "They'll agree to a reasonable proposal. I mean... free engine... right?"

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Well, someone's still going to have to load and run them, right?"

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "That too.. Hi Gerald."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "They're mad that your proposing to extend the railway north, into an area traditionally served by the boatmen."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "You can either elect to not extend the rail, do a complementary deal with them (steam engines for freight), or both."

'The Steam Heroes'. Wulfgang muses during the days after the mining incident. Between half-pursued studies and a relationship with Cassandra, pursued delicately under threat of rifle, Wulfgang formulates a plan. 'The Steam Heroes' may not exactly be enough capital to finish the project, but it should get them started.

First to be tackled is the boatmen. Famous enough himself, he doesn't even need to pull favors through the elder Mr. Stentz to gain an audience with Mr. Fauntgard of the guild. In a public and well lit place, of course. The place chosen turns out to be a cafe, under the crisp air, the two sit, chatting lightly about the weather, the seasons, whatever other niceties come across to avoid the intense negotiations in the first place. Mr. Fauntgard is an older gentleman, but too old to be shoved behind the desk. His arms still do little to conceal the bulk gained from a adulthood working on the harbor. The last story he relates to the younger Mr. Stentz is about his being chosen to represent the boys. A regret for speaking up to this day.

Wulfgang begins, "Yes, but you seem to capture their interests well. But something doesn't make sense to me. My research group is trying to bring you more work-"

"Those mechanical whatsists are going to bring an end to the dock!" Mr. Fauntgard asserts, cutting Wulfgang off. Wulfgang watches the man patiently.

"Yes. Such is true." Wulfgang pauses, "But, they still don't run on the water yet." Another pause. "Any they won't load and unload themselves."

Mr. Fauntgard has his mouth open, ready object, before the realization hits him. Wulfgang continues...

"ANd it's not like the university will be providing drivers for all of the landboats, or whatever their name will be. In fact, your guild will need to start new branches wherever the rails run, yes?" Wulfgang pauses, then adds, for the slow, "More dues. More people."

Mr. Fauntgard objects, "But we already service the north! It'll cut into our profits."

Wulfgang fixes him with a somewhat strange look, "I'm not really sure I see, but, fine, look." He thinks for a second, "What if I have our engineer retrofit a few of the ships that service the northern line with steam engines. It will be a final test for us, and you can keep the working engines to run steam on both lines."

Fauntgard takes his time, slowly thinking about it, "Three ships. And they have to all run."

Wulfgang replies, "I promise, they'll run when we're done..." and reaches out, shaking Fauntgard's hand. The deal is done...

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Interesting."

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "No likey?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "I like it. I presume that Gerald will be supervising the refit. In which case, I'd like to invite Mike to comment on that."

> (OOC) TysGM sees Gerald is logged in.

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "WUlfgang is the type to primise things then arrange for them later. THis is fine."

> (OOC) Gerald is thinking about the general theme of his bit.

> (OOC) Wulfgang would like setups for the 'negotiating passage' things, cause I don't think I have enough info to really just write those.

> (OOC) TysGM hmms.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "By the time we're done with this, it should be the start of a new school year. In all likelihood the last one you /must/ attend."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "I think I'd like to go ahead and start my bit as a dialogue with Wulfgang. Wulfgang, in this scene your motivation is to prevent Gerald from designing a steam engine that will do 40 knots upstream, require a University degree to control (much less maintain), and occasionally explode."

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "That's kk"

---

When Gerald gets the word of Wulfgang's new project, he is thrilled. "After our last trip, I've found all sorts of ways we can improve the engine!" he says, already running around in his lab as he talks. "If I use six cylinders rather than four, I can get a more consistent thrust, and I've got this wonderful plan for a control system - the plans are on the desk there, watch out for the char marks on the floor, there might still be some unstable chemicals there..."

The plans, meticulously laid out, make Gerald's modifications to Lord Fowler's telescope look like a child's toy; Wulfgang himself can barely follow them, and he already knows his way around a steam engine.

> (OOC) Gerald says, "I can continue on in this vein for some length. Just let me know when you want to weigh in"

> (OOC) Wulfgang is posing now. :)

Wulfgang is taken aback, as Gerald accosts him about his latest idea, "I swear the walls have ears. I just wish they were mine." He looks at Gerald, then down at the plans, then back at Gerald. He points to a likely looking place in the diagram. "Oookay. So, what is this linkage breaks, he begins, trying to slow Gerald, and the engine, down.

"Walls have ears? What? Oh, I've been working on this in my spare time," Gerald says. "I honestly wasn't expecting to be able to use the ideas _this_ soon. Oh, by the way, the walls _do_ listen, they just don't have much to say usually. Depends on how much quartz they have in them." He pulls himself out of a partially dismantled steam boiler, which starts rattling the instant he steps away. "Oh, _that_ linkage. Well, if you're just using regular coal it'd probably just strip the gears, but if you're using this additive I've been working on, the gearbox will probably explode." Though he generally keeps ahead of it, the occasional scorch mark on the ceiling or shattered axle suggests a reason for Gerald's casual attitude to explosions.

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Ah the 'it hasn't killed me yet'. Enjoyed my mad scientists and druggies everywhere. :)"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Request: If you can work in the crystal orb flitting around, it won't be muttering anything very comprehensible, but it makes a good lab pet."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "OK. I'll do that in my next post."

Wulfgang stops for a second, "Okay Gerald. It breaks. And strips the gears out. But if you turned it down it wouldn't totally slag the machine when it's done, right?" He pauses, "ANd who's going to fix it when it does melt the gearbox?" He says, still talking in a slow, deliberate tone, following the proves psychology of, if you act like you want people to act, they'll eventually follow along out of embarrassment for you.

> (OOC) TysGM laughs. "Good. :)

"Well, if you don't use the additive, you won't get the full thirty knots out of the engine," Gerald says. "But I guess if you're that worried about..." He is momentarily distracted as he watches First of Six hover by, with the sound like crystalline chimes. "Fix the... huh, I dunno. Who've they got working for them? I mean, you promised, what was it, three of these?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "The Chancellor uses that one a lot. Along with, 'If you talk in a slow, deliberate tone and ask questions where the answer is obvious to even a five year old, you can make any runaway genius feel like an idiot.'"

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Mirroring actually works really well if you know how to use it."

> (OOC) Gerald looks some things up. A river tends to flow at a rate of one to five knots. There was a 1920s riverboat design with a top speed of 15 knots.

Wulfgang nods, "Right three. And they're only expecting 10 knots of out their engines. Heck, they only get 7 or 8 now." He pauses, speeding up too much for his point, "I'm sure it'll be the same people who run the ships now? Ever met them? They're nice folk.. But they're no Gerald Linkletter." He hints.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Modern watercraft can exceed 60 knots but that's a full two tech levels above what you can pull off in a casual task."

"So you mean more like Ricardo-" Gerald says, and then comes to a sudden stop. Behind him, the rattling steam boiler spits out a cog and starts venting steam. "Oh. Wow. I mean... Huh. That's going to be tricky."

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Design a ship that ALec can run."

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "c.c"

Wulfgang continues, "But, I think my dad has an extra ship.. that we can put whatever engine you want on. To test the theories, of course. Then we can fit the other ships with nice, safe, slow, reliable engines that Ricardo can run." He pauses, "Deal?"

> (OOC) Alec steers by shooting metallic Gerald effigies

> (OOC) TysGM says, "That would be an interesting system of sympathetic magic."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Or maybe more accurately, unsympathetic magic. Misanthropic magic?"

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "appethetic magic?"

Gerald nods absently. "Even someone like Ricardo's going to need _some_ training, but... okay, so we want things as simple as possible. Gears in only two or three sizes, each of which is easily distinguishable from the others. Need to make it so the whole mechanism can be seen at once..." He's already a million miles away, but at least this time it's in the right direction.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK. Anybody else have anything?"

> (OOC) Wulfgang is good.

> (OOC) Gerald is good.

> (OOC) Alec is adequate.

> (OOC) TysGM has some exposition, then.

---

They're calling it 'The Summer of Steam'.

Anyone who bothers to trace the phrase to its birth place would come to the press of Isiah Fields. Dingy and second-hand though it may be, it never ceases. The young journalist is popular with the working-classes for his sensationalized depictions of life in the City and The Wilds Beyond. It is he who names the season, and the name takes root in the collective imagination.

And why not? Sometimes one year makes all the difference. Not so long ago, steam was a curiosity, an experimental thing of marginal value compared to a good team of horses. But now they're showing up everywhere. The middle classes of the city see them as a novelty; the working classes, variously, as a threat, or a solution to filth and toil; and the lords, as an engine of profit. With interest comes demand, and now tinkers all over town are selling cheap but servicible steam gadgetry in a dozens of shapes. Some of them even work.

Few of these curios approach the precision or power of the engines coming from the University workshops. This, too, shows up in the public's imagination: of course, it's the work of the Steam Heros, tireless inventors and innovators. Perhaps the real shock comes at the end of June, when accounts are tallied, and Bandwul discovers that he owes Gerald's family a considerable sum for the lad's labors. A bank-cheque is sent... eventually.

Historians would later think it strange that the word 'sorceror' never entered the public's imagination. But then, they'd had other things on their mind.

---

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Couple more."

The middle of summer sees the first fruits of the railway project. The River Guild announces regular steam-passenger service with stops all the way from the City to Fort Hammer. At Gerald's insistence, the three shallow-draft riverboats bear the unlikely names 'Inspiration', 'Perspiration', and 'Combustion'. All three feature a simple and efficient engine design: a double-expansion boiler driving a flywheel, which in turn drives paddle-wheels through a series of gears. Wulfgang is tasked with training the first cadre of mechanics. The process takes the better part of a month, and cements Wulfgang's reputation... and by extension, his father's.

The first iron rails wind east into the hills where iron is mined and the peat bogs from whence comes coal. Horse-drawn wagon trains are adapted to run on the iron rails, until a proper 'steam train' can be devised; for the moment, these wagons bring the raw material for the rails' continued expansion. The next rails wind their way west, towards Lord Fowler's estate. Minor though his position may be, Fowler has been instrumental in negotiating agreements with the farmers and landlords.

A few villages grumble when they discover that they are in the way of progress. The further west one goes, the more the railway is seen as an encroachment of City hegemony on settlements that had believed themselves independent. The impression is reinforced by the small army of railmen, diggers, surveyors, engineers, and hangers-on. It's not come to blows... yet.

The University treats the excavations as an inexhaustible ledger of fieldwork for students interested in natural history... and, frequently, for students that aren't all that interested, but who didn't manage to get out of the room in time. Frederic is often drafted to supervise the digs, and so he's not much seen by the other Steam Heroes of late. Every few days, a new crate of specimens, fossils, and reports show up in his office. When the academic does return, sunburned and sweaty, he's shocked to discover that his door no longer opens and the interior is almost impassible.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "I think Alec has something, thn I need you to pay attention for a few more minutes."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Why don't we all have a nice cup of tea while I go get the plans out of the files?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "... eh?"

While Alec is no great shakes as inventor or diplomat or anything of use, he's got something which profit-minded lords find useful and beset citizens find comforting, and that's a sense of what's right and wrong. Accordingly, he takes time to laboriously scrawl out some letters, to be delivered upriver to the forst. As a first-hand witness to what the riverboats can mean for the fort and its mission, he's got some suggestions: start exchanging knowledge about bandits and criminals with the City, quicker than any horseman could, and start deploying soldiers right off the boats and into the wilderness, so they can cut off the bandits as they move.

> (OOC) Alec says, "that's it from me"

> (OOC) TysGM NODS

> (OOC) TysGM ack

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK, moving on..."

The militia takes Alec's advice. For a while, the correspondence to coordinate the initiative ends up in Alec's hands - irregular but predictable, since the commandant of Fort Hammer is father to both Alec and Cassandra. But one of these letters catches Alec's eye. The handwriting on the envelope is clearly his father's, but the intended recipient is clearly another father - Wulfgang's.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "This would be mid-June. Do you intervene or let it pass?"

> (OOC) Alec says, "hmm."

> (OOC) Alec says, "ultimately I think it's gotta go to the right place"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK"

Alec passes the message on to the regular post who, he presumes, dutifully deliver it to the elder Stentz. Two mornings later, the same postman delivers the reply: addressed to Captain Teague. This is not exactly improper; as the Competent Son of a military officer, Alec (and, for that matter, Cassandra) have a de facto status as 'commissionaires'. The post office seems to have assumed that Alec is the intentional point of contact.

> (OOC) Alec will ship this one along too

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Hmmmmmmmmm."

> (OOC) Wulfgang Hmmmmmmmmms too

The reply goes out with the next packet. A few days later, the postman drops off a hefty bundle of letters. One is from Wulfgang's father to Wulfgang; one is from Captain Teague for the elder Mister Stentz, along with a letter each for Cassandra and Alec. Another letter is addressed to 'The Steam Heroes' in general, care of Frederic, and it seems to have found it's way to Alec in Frederic's absence. The final two letters are addressed to Gerald, from the school's bursar: one is a check for 'Services of a Mechanical Nature'. The other is a bill, not quite as large as the check, for repairing all the holes he blew in the roof of his lab while experimenting with fuel additives.

> (OOC) Alec will open.

> (OOC) Wulfgang opens letter too. c.c

> (OOC) Gerald opens his mail if someone lassos him, yanks the screwdriver and wrench out of his hands, and thrusts the letters in. n.n

> (OOC) TysGM finishes whispering to Alec. Now Wulfgang.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Gerald, you know what's there. Money on the one hand and a bill on the other. The difference is still a tidy sum but you might want to consider the implications of the University using you as a one-man foundry operation."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "To wit, I could make a handy living but I'd be making steam engines for the rest of my life?"

> (OOC) Wulfgang hmm

> (OOC) Wulfgang rolls 3d6 for 4 (2 1 1) vs. 14, succeeding by 10

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Let's just say that you might want to consider a base of operations with thick, non-flammable walls and a very thin roof."

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Hay Bill.. If I just type 'roll at 14' I don't get any response."

> (OOC) Alec says, "you must specify 3d at least. I can make that the default in gurps rooms tho"

> (OOC) Alec says, "fixed"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "OK. Everyone's gotten their respective private messages. So now the main one:"

The message addressed to the 'Steam Heroes' generally, is an invitation from the Fowler family to the inaugural voyage of the western rail line: commencing at the railyard that's spring up near the docks, and ending at the Fowler estate. The guest list is a who's who of the rail venture, as well as a few more bigwigs from local guilds who couldn't be bothered to attend last time. The Teamsters' representatives are conspicuous in their absence; the Boatmen conspicuous in their presence.
