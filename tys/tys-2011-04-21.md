The train rolls on, through glens and past fields. The view out the left side of the train is the old western road, paved through decades of use and abuse. The view out the right side shows signs of recent activity: tree stumps, diverted streams, signs of laborer's encampments that have recently come and more recently moved on. Three times the train passes over trestle bridges so new that the scent of pine is still on them, reaching the cabin even over the scent of coal fires.

In some thirty minutes more, the train slows to the pace of a fast walk. The low stone pillars guarding the lane to Fowler's estate pass by on the right; a platoon of servants - nearly all of the household staff, by the look - are waiting in formation just beyond. As the train shudders to a halt, they approach.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "One more"

The party guests leave the train, assisted here and there by a maid or butler. Apparently you have to walk from here; the train doesn't go onto the estate proper. The tracks do continue further west, following the coast road, and disappear after a few twists and turns. So this isn't the end of the line, not really, just a ceremonial one. Fowler's coach is waiting for the handful of guests who are too aged, important, and self-important to make the trip on foot.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Anything you guys want to do, or just following along for now?"

> (OOC) Alec will chill with Cassie

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Ahyes. Your darling sister."

> (OOC) Gerald has finally twigged to the fact that something happened on the train ride. He's going to be awkwardly hanging around wondering if he can help in some way.

Cassandra is the last to leave the train, three full minutes after everyone else has moved on. A trainman follows her, not so much shooing her out, as watching to make sure she's not coming back. She looks straight ahead and makes her way up the lane, almost at a march, certainly with deliberate composure.

> (OOC) Alec says, "only reason I'm not already shootin' is she hasn't asked for it"

> (OOC) Wulfgang c.c

> (OOC) Alec says, "not you for once!"

Wulfgang , having already exited the train, hovers around the exit waiting for Cassandra to exit. He's a little wary when he sees that she comes with her usual honor guard, but still waves to her.

Cassandra slows so Wulfgang can catch up. "Your father is a wretch," she says softly.

Somewhere along the line, Gerald finally realized that something upsetting happened on the train ride, involving Wulfgang and Cassandra. He can't think of anything to do about it, but he tags along uncertainly in the hope that he might somehow think of something.

Wulfgang looks, and sighs, putting his hand behind his head, "Honestly, knowing him, he's probably not even aware that he did anything." He says, casting a glance to Alec, and smiles at Gerald. "At least, that seems to be how he normally operates." Wulfgang says, exasperatedly.

Alec stays quiet, but near.

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Sorry, I caught SIGPOOP from /proc/dog and I have to clean up it's core dump from ~"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "ow"

> (OOC) Wulfgang injures all with really bad puns.

"Oh, he knew," she mutters. "I wrote to my father, asking him to write to your father - weeks ago, before we went to that haunted mine - and solicit his permission for me to... court you." The admission brings her up short and she wheels on Wulfgang, seemingly oblivious to the presence of Gerald or Alec. Fredric is nowhere to me found, nor are the senior Stentzes; everyone seems to have moved along up the lane. "You can't possibly mean to ACCEPT this ridiculous proposal!" Cassandra yelps. For emphasis she pokes Wulfgang in the chest with her finger. "You've never even met her! She's six years older than you! She must be some kind of tarted-up, empty-headed little fool of a girl!"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "More coming"

> (OOC) Alec may just shoot Wulfgang on general principle now

Actually, the words she uses are far less polite. Also, the young lady's accent disappears, replaced with a more provincial, coarse twang identical to Alec's or a hinterland soldier. She continues on in the same voice. "I bet she's never once shot at a brigand, or stop-cut a red beast, or... or... not ridden side-saddle. Well, I'm an _adventuress_, and if that doesn't take your fancy, good luck with your old maid!"

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "IC or OOC?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "IC"

> (OOC) Wulfgang is asking Alec

> (OOC) Alec says, "hmm, well:"

Alec scratches his chin. "Reckon you ain't met her neither, sis," he observes. "Save your fire for the man who done you wrong. This girl hasn't harmed you yet."

> (OOC) Alec says, "one more"

The young man smiles a bit. "Besides. Wulfgang don't need any persuadin' of the quality of lady speakin to him."

Wulfgang looks sidelong to Cassandra. "You really expect me to accept this? And you honestly expect me to just roll over and play toy for some older woman?" He shakes his head, "And yet you want to court me?" He manages to let slip out before he can stop himself. Still, he rolls with it, "No, I wasn't intending to take this lying down in any sense of the word." He shakes his head. "Besides. She may want me as a suitor exactly as much as I prefer her."

Cassandra's brows furrow, and she seems to grind her teeth as if chewing her way through this new thought. In a few moments her composure and cultured accent both return. "You are both right, of course. Let's meet the enemy first. And yes, Wulfgang," she sighs, "I would have you court me. This isn't how I wished to say it." She sets off back up the lane. "But we'll see if your woman can save you from one primped-up socialite."

> (OOC) TysGM revises that slightly

"It's not right," is all Gerald can think to say, lagging behind both literally and metaphorically. "People shouldn't be treated as cogs in a machine. Especially not your own son."

Wulfgang says, "Right or not, it's how he thinks things are done." He does wonder, privately mind you, who exactly is going to end up saving him from whom.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Anyone else?"

> (OOC) TysGM guesses not

---

By the time the Steam Heroes catch up to the bulk of the party, the guests are on their way to their various quarters. Normal rules of hospitality would give them an hour or to to freshen up and change before afternoon tea - but the rail trip was so fast, most seem hardly fatigued at all. Most seem to be accomodated in outbuildings - the coach house, a few guest cottages, the servant's quarters. The bedrooms in the manor house seem to be reserved for important guests.

To that end, an errand-boy approaches and leads the Steam Heroes to some rooms on the top floor of the manor. Though somewhat cramper - perhaps this was once the attic - they at least have a decent view and real plumbing. Fowler, at least, considers you important. So does the errand-boy; he asks for autographs on the back of a dime-novel.

> (OOC) Wulfgang fears, but wife-idles a touch.

In particular, the view from the window includes the entirety of the back lawn, and also Fowler's amateur observatory. The short tower and its dome are visible. Oddly, the dome is open, even though it's daylight and no guests are visible yet.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "It's in your hands now. The next event is the afternoon tea. You've got about 90 minutes until it's served."

> (OOC) Alec will hang out with the gang.

> (OOC) Wulfgang is anxious to get to the party, but might avoid it is pursuaded.

> (OOC) TysGM has disconnected.

Gerald lingers at the window. "Why is the dome open in the middle of the day? How strange." He looks round at the others. "Want to go check it out while we wait?"

> (OOC) TysGM has connected.

> (OOC) TysGM changed a fiewall setting. It had unforseen consequences.

Wulfgang shrugs, "I've got nothing pressing to resolve anymore." he says, smirking.

"Excellent! Let's go. Besides, I think I figured out what I did wrong with the telescope last time," Gerald says, grinning.

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Is Cassandra coming along?"

The observatory is much as it was last time - formerly a shed, probably a toolshed to judge by the contents. A spiral staircase in the middle of the room leads up to second floor, where the dome has been built over a rough-fit but cozy study. The rim of the dome is about head-height; the shutters have been rolled back, and the telescope is still there, pointing up and out into space. The big brass instrument glitters gleams in the mid-day sun.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Yes. She's still trying to figure out what to do."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "So she figures, might as well keep an eye on you."

> (OOC) TysGM makes some qrolls, brb

Gerald pulls out a screwdriver and advances on the telescope with a predatory gleam in his eye. "Finally! A chance to work on this thing with no one to interrupt!" he says, a little bit too melodramatically. He looks back over his shoulder to see how the others respond, a wide grin on his face.

> (OOC) Alec says, "all he needs to do is twirl his mustache at this point"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "You have no idea."

Wulfgang blinks, "Erm... Gerald.. Are you.. supposed to be touching that?"

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Tie Cassy to the railroad tracks?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Throw daddy from the train?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Oh, wait, that's Wulfgang."

Gerald bursts into laughter. "I'm _joking_, Wulfgang. After all the fuss last time, I'm not going to monkey with it again," he says, as he pockets the screwdriver. "Still, I should probably take some notes... hello, what's this?" he says, poking at the notebooks piled on the table. "The Kinematics of Comets?" he says, turning a page.

Wulfgang blinks, "ERm. I guess if you're sure..."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Hold on, Gerald is reading. In fact... I have a pose."

"Ssh," says Gerald, rapt upon the working notes. "Star charts... pretty complicated ones, too. Planetary orbits... oh wow, _calculus_, I hardly ever get to use this with machines. This is serious business." He rubs his chin. "Whoever did this work is a genius. I bet _he_ could tell me what he wants done with the telescope."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Oh, that's better. Never mind what I had."

Cassandra has picked up another volume from the worktable. "I just be _he_ could." She holds up the book, open about to the middle. "Notice anything odd about this handwriting?"

Gerald squints at the notes. "Not really. Very neat, when it needs to be. What're you talking about?" For all his brilliance with machines, Gerald can be remarkably slow on some subjects.

Cassandra closes the book and points to the name on the front cover. _Sonja Appleton_. "A woman's name for a woman's script," she says. "This was written by Wulfgang's bride-to-be."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "I dare any of you to shout 'Impossible! Girls are no good at math!'"

"I think the thing ya said was 'empty-headed'," observes Alec.

Wulfgang blinks, thinks for a moment, then, "Wait, you wrote it?" He puts on his winningest smile, and probably pauses a touch too long before, "Yeah, but the same thing would describe Gerald, in some things at least." He keeps smiling though, "Oh good. Maybe we'll have more company."

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Or, if you prefer: 'GIven how this day has turned out, I would expect she's right behind me'"

Gerald blinks. "Wait. Really?" He reads the cover again, as if daring it to disappear. "Wow. I... huh, that never occured to me. Hey, Wulfgang, if you manage to shake her off you, could you introduce her to me?"

As if on cue, there's a sound from below - the shed door sliding open and closed again, followed by footsteps that halt at the bottom of the spiral stair. After a brief pause, a woman's voice floats up. "Hello? Who's up there?" it asks. "I could hear you, you know."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Aww. I'm a failure at dramatic tension. If you see it coming it's just silly. I might as well give you a catgirl maid."

Gerald starts, and blushes bright red. "Ah, I, uh," he stammers, looking frantically to Wulfgang and fidgeting with his screwdriver.

"This here's the Steam Heroes," calls down Alec.

> (OOC) Wulfgang says, "Sorry. Rather, think of us as dramatic device experts. And I \_didn't\_ see it coming untill I saw it was her book, to be fair."

"The who?" she replies. "Are you tumblers or something? Did my Uncle hire a circus for the weekend?" You hear her coming up the stairs, neither hurried nor cautious.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Give me a moment to type this."

> (OOC) Alec waits then. was gonna answer her

> (OOC) TysGM says, "No, go ahead. You'll be able to before she gets up there, and I want to hear it."

"Guests of Lord Fowler. Wulfgang Stentz, Gerald Linkletter, and Cassanda and Alec Teague," answers Alec. He glances at the book, but doesn't voice his guess. Let others introduce themselves before assuming.

Wulfgang says, "So, we are a kind of circus. But we usually dont' do private parties." WUlfgang adds."

> (OOC) TysGM replies

At the name Stentz, she stops. "The University fellows," she says evenly, as she resumes climbing. After a moment she comes into view.

The woman is a bit taller than Cassandra, and a bit older than everyone except Alec. Her features are lean, with piercing blue eyes, and high cheekbones. Her face is made sharper by her hair, which is pulled back in a bun that looks like it was tied rather hurridley. The color of her hair is an odd mix of jet-black, with lighter streaks like she's spent a lot of time in the sun or out to sea. The hypothesis is backed up by her skin - tanned face and forearms, rather dark but probably once much darker. In contrast, her attire looks entirely provincial and stay-at-home: wool skirt, wool jacket, white blouse with a cameo broach. Truth be told, it's a mode of dress typical to women closer to your parents' age.

The woman's eyes flit around the room, not meeting anyone's gaze, but taking in a lot of detail. They fixate briefly on Gerald, who is still holding the astronomy treatise in one hand, and a screwdriver in the other. (Although truth be told, the word 'screwdriver' no longer adequately describes the tool - which at its least esoteric moments resembles the unintended offspring of a grasshopper and a pocketwatch.) Suddenly her eyes go wide. "Hey! Don't get oil on that!" she cries out.

> (OOC) Gerald responds.

"Sorry!" says Gerald frantically, putting the notebook down and wiping his hands on his pants. "Y-you're really the one who wrote all... this?" he says, gesturing at the collection of astronomical data.

> (OOC) TysGM amends that, wait

"Yes," she replies, hurridley stepping over and checking the notebook over. "And are you the young man who tried to improve my Uncle's telescope? Your name wouldn't be Stentz, would it?" she asks, a hopeful note in her voice.

Gerald shakes his head. "Sorry. I'm Gerald Linkletter. But yes, I'm the one who tried tinkering with the telescope. And I'm very pleased to meet you." He gives her an uncertain and bashful grin.

Sonja is perhaps an inch taller than Gerald, but suddenly she carries herself like she might be an inch shorter than everyone in the room. "Oh. Yes." She offers her hand. "Likewise. I had an unanticipated need for mechanical aid... but..." She points at Wulfgang. "You're the young Mister Stentz, then?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "One sec"

Wulfgang blinks, "So it would seem." He smiles, and takes a step backwards, unsure of Sonja and her intentions. "THis is Alec, and Cassandra, too." Wulfgang smiles. "Ms. Appleton, I presume?"

> (OOC) Gerald will definitely shake hands with Sonja, but wait until everyone else is sorted otu...

> (OOC) Wulfgang isn't going to touch her incase he catches marriage or something.

Before Wulfgang can say more, Cassandra steps up behind him... quite close. Wulfgang can hear her breathing, and he'd swear he can also hear gears grinding. Cassandra's hand descends lightly but possessively on his shoulder. "Yes," she says, "Of course that's Ms. Appleton. She looks just like her lovely aunt, the same eyes and much the same hair. Wulfgang and I are pleased to make your accquaintance, Ms. Appleton... may we call you Sonja?" she says, in a lilt both bright and brittle. "'Ms' seems just entirely too formal. Almost like 'Mrs'."

> (OOC) TysGM is sitting here waiting for Fiona to respond. Realizes he's playing BOTH of these NPCs. Well. We're nearly done for tonight.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Anything from players who aren't me?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Sorry. Name is Sonja. Not Fiona. x\_x"

> (OOC) Alec is on it

Alec lets out a brief sigh. "Ma'am. If we're intrudin' on your space, we should be gettin' back. Y'see, Mr. Linkletter here has a right fondness for machinery such as this telescope. And if you haven't heard of the Steam Heroes, let me tell ya at least this much.."

"When you look through that telescope, there's a chance that what you see beyond our blue sky, them twinklin' stars up there that you've so lovingly charted? One o' them might be the true birthplace of humankind, if these folks is correct. You'd best get that story from Gerald, 'cause he's seen some of it himself."

> (OOC) "(six hours later) And then he threw a car at my head."

> (OOC) Alec says, "doin my best to steer her in the player-approved direction!"

"Oh, that's such a long tale," Cassandra says quickly. "Wulfgang, perhaps we should go find the Professor, so he can help to tell it. I'm sure we can leave Ms. Appleton in Mister Linkletter's care for a time. You do promise to be a gentlemen, Gerald? Of course he does," she continues, not waiting for a reply. The hand on Wulfgang's shoulder is suddenly steering him towards the stairwell. "And I wonder where that Fields fellow has gotten to," she says, suddenly serious. "Oh, I hope we haven't caused trouble by inviting him. He seems like such a nosy fellow. Well. We have work to do. Good luck, Gerald! With the telescope repair, I mean.""

> (OOC) TysGM fixes

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Closers?"

> (OOC) Wulfgang will have something.

Wulfgang does open his mouth, but finds at least two people here helping him out. He looks to be in a bit of a daze as he is thusly steared away from the object of grave danger. He does whisper in Cassandra's ear as they retreat, "It won't be quite that easy, you know." But otherwise keeps quiet.

"Oh, she's quite, quite wrong for you," Cassandra replies. "That sort always ends up being so bossy."
