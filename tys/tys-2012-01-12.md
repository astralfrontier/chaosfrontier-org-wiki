> (OOC) Gerald says, "Let's see what I can do. I'm going to pretty much assume this will take some time based on fatigue regen."

> (OOC) Alec says, "a really awesome spell for you in general, btw: Seek Magic. If there's anything closer than, say, one of those Lost Civilization Bunkers, you'll find it"

> (OOC) Alec says, "also includes magical beings such as demons, elementals, spirits, etc."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "That's probably the first thing I do, right around the site where the corpse was found."

The new deceased is a man in his early thirties. The cause of death is almost certainly the stab wound in his lower back, right below the rib cage, and up into the lung. It may or may not have reached his heart, but he did bleed an awful lot before dying. His clothes, coarse-cut working man's stuff, but in good repair, have large blood stains on the back of the shirt and jacket. The boots match a pair that Alec saw at the campsite, and intermittently since; sometimes he rode in the wagon, and sometimes he walked. The body is prone, face turned to the side to reveal a mixture of shock, panic, and despair. The fading rays of the sun make it all look just that much more ghastly and surreal.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Fire away then."

> (OOC) Gerald poses the first bit.

Normally, Gerald would not bother to check for supernatural intervention in the case of such a murder. But since the entire case has clearly been touched by the immaterial, starting with poor Dane Clay, it cannot be excluded. Gerald closes his eyes, settling himself into a state of meditative concentration. Perhaps there is _nothing_ nearby, apart from himself, that has been substantially touched by sorcery or its close relatives; but if there is, Gerald means to find it.

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Knowledge at 12-, with long-distance modifiers."

> (OOC) Gerald rolls 3d6 for 10 (5 2 3) vs. 12, succeeding by 2

> (OOC) Gerald says, "That's good for up to a mile."

> (OOC) Alec says, "if you believe that you can find something at longer range, and the townsfolk aren't too superstitious, we can build up more energy and trade that for skill."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "I'll hold off on that for now. Unless Seek Magic pings, there may be something more specific I would want to use that ritual for. If we find something that we can use Seeker on, for example..."

> (OOC) TysGM catches up

> (OOC) TysGM hmmm

Gerald's first venture into the spirit realm for this matter, was the bridge itself; the structure recalling its own damage at the hands of several men. Something strange happened to Dane Clay; something involving water and blood. But this poor fellow, is simply a victim of all too human brutality.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "A little more..."

Gerald sits cross-legged on the ground, staring at the body for a minute or so... or so it seems to onlookers. For Gerald, there's the feeling of relaxation, concentration... and then of discontinuity. A moment of nightmare, a pain in his back, like he's been kicked by a horse, but much, much worse... falling forward, a splash of blood on the bare earth, turning a microscopic layer of dusty cornfield soil into mud... and more than mud...

Gerald awakens with a start, knowing only that the man is dead, and somehow, the earth in this spot, seems to remember the deed. But that's it. The piece of steel responsible for the wound, and the perpetrators, are long gone from here.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "That's all the magic that's present. Also, you guys have been walking all day, so you're down 2 fatigue already. If you're going to keep casting we'd better keep track."

> (OOC) Alec says, "let's make sure the local cops take a statement first. they can do their thing while we rest"

> (OOC) Alec says, "if I missed it and that's done, great"

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Yeah. I think resting is definitely indicated here. I don't think the trail's going to get /much/ colder from here, not in a day."

> (OOC) TysGM hmm

> (OOC) Gerald says, "That said..."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "You won't find a cop in the village, but you can send for one when the train comes by and picks up the mail."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "It could be a few hours before one gets there, or the following morning."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "How many people in the party?"

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Me, Wulfgang, Alec, Cassandra, Frederic..."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "No Sonja, no Frederic."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Cassandra, mostly because she doesn't want to let Wulfgang out of her sight right now."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "OK. Well, I'm contemplating doing divination of some stripe, though technically I don't meet the prerequisites for a lot of them since I don't have any non-Knowledge spells."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "anyway, a brief pose."

Gerald shakes his head, and gets wearily to his feet. "Nothing spooky here," he says. "Men did this, as they so often do." He shudders, glancing at the corpse again. "There may be some ethereal trace of the deed yet, but I will need to rest before I try anything further. And the more I know about this man in advance, and about the circumstances of this murder, the better my chances."

The Steam Heros are walking back through the field towards the inn. It is now dusk; the innkeeper catches hold of Alec's sleeve, to get his attention... then releases it when he realizes what a terribly dangerous thing that is. Still, he manages to stammer out a question. "The young fellow, talking about spooks... what's he on about? Is he some kind of priest? Or shaman?"

"He's somethin'," replies Alec, in typically elaborate fashion.

Gerald winces briefly, overhearing the exchange. "I'm a scientist," he says. "It's just... you can do science on things other than clockwork and gears and steam, that's all."

"Like bodies," Alec observes.

This seems to mollify the innkeeper... a bit. "Oh. Science. Yes, we hear all about science now." He pauses, looking for something else to say, and fails. "Well. The last train will be coming through soon. Should we, uh... send for the Watch? In the evening mailbag?"

Alec hums. "Yeah."

> (OOC) Alec says, "'did ALec come through here?' 'the talkative fella?' 'no.' 'ayuh, he did then.'"

Gerald nods in agreement. "The Watch has their own science of bodies," he observes. "They've developed it over the centuries, by trial and error. I'd be thrilled to watch them at work."

Back at the inn, the innkeeper hands a room key to Alec and another to Cassandra. The men are in a single large room with several bunks; Cassandra, by herself in a not particularly spacious adjoining room, probably meant for someone's maid. As the innkeeper moves off to busy himself with the evening post, she shrugs, and quietly drops the key back on the counter. "I'm safer without a wall between myself and you very dangerous gentlemen," she says, without a hint of irony.

And so, with the dust of many miles on their boots, at an inn in a hamlet just small enough to lack any name, the Steam Heroes retire for the evening.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "The watch will arrive in the morning. Nobody messes with you overnight. Resume another time?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Or continue?"

> (OOC) Alec says, "I'm okay either way."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "I would rather wait."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "I'm fine with that. I'm pretty tired, and I'm not good at thinking outside the dice rolls in those circumstances."
