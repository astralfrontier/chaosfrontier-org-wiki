The night in the inn passes uneventfully. The village is only two hours from the city walls, but that slim margin of miles is the difference between urban bedlam and nights under brilliantly clear skies where the loudest sound is the breeze in the fields - or possibly the snoring of several exhausted students, on the trail of multiple murders.

> (OOC) Alec z.z

Morning arrives before anyone realizes it. A train whistle breaks the silence, a sign of modernity rudely intruding on a fitful night's sleep. Soon, the train can be seen through the attic window; chugging to a stop at the rough-hewn platform recently built at the north end of town. It remains for only a few minutes. Soon it chugs off to the west, leaving behind a few crates, and two men in uniform.

Alec recognizes the uniforms, if not the men in them. The Watch is generally a peer with the Fleet or the militia, though under direct control of the City Council. Rank insignia indicates that one of them is an officer, and the other - the one carrying the valise - is a corporal. They're walking directly towards the inn, and do not seem to be speaking to each other.

> (OOC) Alec says, "guess I'll flag em down"

Alec makes his way downstairs to greet the pair - Sergeant Cross and Corporal Stromm. They've heard of the Steam Heroes, of course, but don't seem to be particularly impressed. However, given his father's position, Alec does have some claim of rank, and so they listen to what he has to say. The three are seated at a table in the dining room and Alec recounts the whole story, starting with last evening's discovery of the Dane Clay's body.

The telling of the tale takes quite some time, at which point the other hotel guests have come down for breakfast. Stromm shoos them off; Cross spends most of his time writing in a notebook and frowning over the details, dragging his thick mustache into a pronounced droop.

Alec reaches the end of his tale. Cross replaces the pencil in his pocket and glances over the notes. "There's an awful lot of... spiritual involvement here." He shakes his head. "Dead man walking, your friend... this Gerald... speaking to the very logs in the bridge, and the ground beneath the corpse. Always complicates police work, it does, when there's shamans involved. Well. I suppose we'd better see the body, and speak to Mister Linkletter. Probably in that order." He looks out the window; the sun is getting higher. "The deceased is now a day old. Not pleasant to let them go too long."

> (OOC) Gerald is available for interviewingz.

Cross travels out to the place where the dead man lies in the field. Since the evening, the crows have come, and it's not a pretty sight. The policemen spend several minutes taking notes and measurements before moving the body; Cross seems to be thinking out loud for the benefit of his sergeant, and the Steam Heroes. He notes that the deceased is a male of the Western race, his height, apparent weight, the state of his clothes, and the presence of the large and obvious stab wound on his back. Stromm dutifully and silently takes it down.

"Right," Cross says. "Now that's done, let's have a proper look at him." He carefully rolls the dead man onto his back. "Nobody I know, and his face is clear enough for now. Check the book." Stromm nods, and pulls a thick string-bound ledger from his valise. Within are portraits - sketches of known criminals and prominent guild figures. The corporal begins flipping through the book while Cross checks the man's pockets. "They left some coinage behind." He holds out a handful of City coins. "Pocket change. Enough for a decent meal. Not enough to kill for, even among gutter rats. They left that, but no papers. No Guild cards, no bank notes, not even a cigarette butt."

Cross gives Gerald a curious look. "Please forgiving me for saying so, lad, but you don't LOOK like a shaman. How do you figure into this?"

"Technically I'm not a shaman," says Gerald, lapsing into his diffident academic persona. "Though I suppose etheric science uses many of the same principles. You could say that shamans use an intuitive approach, whereas mine is more formalized..." A glance from Alex reminds him that he's drifting off topic. "Sorry. Anyway. Well, I guess I got involved in the first place because someone thought the Steam Heroes were the right people to come to for Dane's death, and once we realized the paranormal was involved, I couldn't help but look further into it." He looks at the train tracks. "Plus, the railroad was at risk."

"Ah, yes, the railroad," Cross says. "Now that's something we can talk about in court, at least as far as motives go." He points back towards the Coast Road, which passes by this field to the south. "And tracks, as well. It sounds to me like they did their job and were going home. And if Mister Teague here is correct, this fellow walked all the way here from the end of the rail line - making him one of your saboteurs. So who killed him and why right here? Was it bandits? Or one of his friends?"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "He seems to be inviting speculation. c\_c If you'd care to."

> (OOC) Alec was getting to that :)

> (OOC) Gerald will leave that to Alec. People aren't Gerald's specialty.

Alec shrugs. "Reckon with the second murder it's gotta be the other fellas," he points out. "Someone's coverin' their tracks."

Gerald scratches his head. "Why kill him, though? Was he having second thoughts? The lack of any papers is weird, too. Do you think they were trying to make it look like a robbery or something?"

"Maybe look like robbery," Cross says. "Otherwise they might have done better hiding the body. Which means they're possibly not very bright, or possibly in a real hurry."

Alec thinks it over a bit. "I thought for a bit a spirit or somethin' might be lookin' out for the rail line. Possessin' someone. If that's the case, maybe it got to both men. Don't know how these fellas would react in that case."

"Or maybe it got to our man here," says Gerald. "Either way, it might be worth studying, now that I'm rested and I can concentrate properly."

"Well, if what you say about the other student is true, that Dane Clay..." he trails off. "Dammit. We can't arrest ghosts and goblins... oh." Corporal Stromm has handed the ledger back to him, pointing at a particular page. "But it seems that we've arrested this fellow before." He hands the ledger over to Alec and Gerald.

The listing shows that the deceased is one Elbert Parsons, a member of one of the Teamsters' Guilds. It also shows a date of birth about thirty years in the past, and a short list of cryptic codes and dates that seem to be arrests, sentences, fines paid, and times served in jails and peat bogs.

> (OOC) Alec says, "I'm not sure what to do about this except 'round up his known associates'"

> (OOC) Gerald says, "So what kind of 'criminal' is he? Mean drunk? Petty bandit? Sneak-thief?"

"Not a very bad one, as they go," Cross comments. "Drunk and disorderly, and petty assault, which means he was in his share of brawls down on the docks. But this one here?" He points. "Stole a cargo from his own guild some time last year. Membership suspended for that one, and duly sentenced to six months digging peat besides. Would have been hard for him to get work after that."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Gerald, you said something about making a 'proper study' now that you're rested. What did you have in mind?"

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Well, I don't have any very clear idea in mind. I was low on FP before, though, and now that I'm rested, I could conceivably have a shot at a divination."

> (OOC) TysGM hmm

> (OOC) Alec says, "there's a few types that are very personal, requiring familiarity with someone's identity - which you should now have enough information to use"

> (OOC) Gerald says, "I could do astrology, now that I have a birthday - I don't actually have the prereq astronomy skill on my sheet, but I should've been able to pick up a few tips from Sonja."

> (OOC) Alec says, "aaactually"

> (OOC) Alec says, "HAY GM, how do you feel about havin Sonja actually assist in the casting? Give her first-hand info on the mechanism of magic"

> (OOC) TysGM hmm. "In that case it will be more like holding a seance. Which you can do, in the middle of the field, in broad daylight."

> (OOC) Alec says, "yeah"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Penny dreadfuls to the contrary. Hadn't anticipated that you would, but if you want to do that? Let's do that."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "And yes, Sonja can give you all the astronomy you need to do competent astrology."

> (OOC) TysGM pulls Thaumatology. "Just give me a minute.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Well. Roll Divination, and given that you've got more to go on, we'll give you a +3 - 1 each for access to interested associates, a name/date of birth/personal history, and being more rested and aware of the situation now. I don't know if that's the 'GURPS Seance' but we can happily call it that if you're willing, and it gives you a target number of 15. "

> (OOC) TysGM ping

Gerald scans the rap sheet, listening to the explanation... and then his eyes pan back to the head of the page. Name and birthdate. "Hmm. There are... rhythms to this world. The motion of our world beneath the stars... and you have his birthdate. That, and his name..." He smiles slightly. "Officers, how would you feel about seeing a little etheric science in action?"

> (OOC) Gerald says, "I can also roll now, if you like."

Cross and the so-far silent Stromm exchange a look. Stromm shrugs. "Not opposed to it, lad. But every judge in the City will tell you that the laws of Man are one thing and the laws of the Divine are another. That, and shamans rarely answer summons to appear in court." He pauses. "But this fellow came to an undeserved bad end. So we'll bear witness to whatever you can find, and do our best to square it in the books."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Sure, go ahead and roll at any time. You'll be paying the usual energy cost but I don't think you'll be getting into a fight before you rest again, so don't bother tracking it."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Just don't cast yourself unconscious. This isn't Shadowrun."

Gerald spreads his hands wide. "I wouldn't ask a judge to listen to _me_ anyway, sir. The etheric science is far too immature to hold up in court. But perhaps it can tell us where to look, and from there it's good old fashioned police work."

> (OOC) Gerald rolls 3d6 for 7 (4 1 2) vs. 15, succeeding by 8

> (OOC) TysGM says, "That's a nice margin. You'll be able to do the ceremony with the two cops present, as well as yourself, Wulfgang, Alec, Sonja, and Cassandra."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Strictly speaking, Sonja didn't come with you, but you can send for her. So it will be mid-afternoon when it happens."

It takes a few hours to arrange the ritual. A few railway workers are heading out on a handcar, and agree to take a message to Fowler's estate. Sonja arrives on the inbound train, close to noon. By then the body has been wrapped in a heavy canvas to keep the sun and crows from spoiling it further, and so she's mercifully spared the sight of the dead man.

Gerald spends the time in meditation. By now, his 'etherics kit' contains an assortment of crystal shards that seem to be related to the floating orbs - pieces of quartz and diamond that speak to Gerald in a way only he can hear. Normally such precious gems would be beyond the budget of a student; but then, the unassuming young man wrote half the patents used by the railroad. So he need never know the cost of his researches.

And so Gerald is not distracted by anything so petty as the value of his tools. Nor does he need any of the usual trappings of the seance: candles, incense, or even the dark of night. The Steam Heroes and watchmen sit quietly in a circle around the deceased, and that's all there is to it.

For quite some time, nothing happens. But then it gets quiet. The sound of the wind in the tall grass subsides, though the grass still moves. Nearby birdcalls fade to nothing. The sky overhead seems to darken from bright blue to a deep navy, though the surrounding landscape is just as brightly lit as before.

Everyone can see it happen. But Sonja is the first to see that there is now movement within the large canvas bundle.

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Want to keep going?"

> (OOC) TysGM kind thought that might get your attention. :/

> (OOC) Gerald says, "I'm game, but time is passing..."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "Alright. Next time, then."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "I would be quitehappy to go on. But that's an awesome cliffhanger."

> (OOC) TysGM says, "I kind of thought that I'd have to be an awful dick to stop there. o\_o"

> (OOC) TysGM says, "But if you want to speak with the dead... well. Here it comes."

> (OOC) Gerald says, "Well, there's a certain aspect of pulp storytelling to Tys. And cliffhangers are a staple."
