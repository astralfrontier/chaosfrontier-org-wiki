> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Okay. To bring everyone up to speed, Welcome. As it stands right now, Phil has said he can't run on Saturday nights. I'm proposing moving the game to Sunday so he can play too, but I need to talk to him about it. "

> (OOC) Menocal says, "I'm okay with that. Not like I'm overly busy."

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "The Problem with Sunday is that I'm traveling every week this month, and one week in February. I wouldn't be able to run a game with everyone until the 13th of Feb. If everyone else is on board, and if Phil is gonna play on Sundays, I would plan on running solos or other things for rez between now and then, whenever we can get some time."

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "I'm hoping to use today to at least get a scene set for where you guys will be."

> (OOC) Katja says, "As long as it doesn't run too late, I'm good with Sundays."

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "I would porbably start at like 5:00 central or somethign to avoid it runnin gtoo late."

> (OOC) Damon says, "So more or less alternating with Tides? I could work with that."

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Yeah. Assuming Phil can play then. If Phil can't play then, I'll keep it on Saturday."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Unfortunately, I have no idea where I will be or what my work schedule will be like next week (if I'll even have one). So I'm good with pretty much anything for now, but that may change later."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Next month. x.x Sorry."

> (OOC) UntergangGM nods.

> (OOC) UntergangGM poses up some background.

> (OOC) Menocal knits a nanosock

'Wilhab is one of the modern outer ring successes. The Wilke brothers, Russ and Tom established the Wilke Gas Mining Group on the site of Wilhab more than 10 years ago, and through their tough business practices and caring touch, acquired the third Hamilton Cylinder to be deployed in Saturn. Diversity and community marks what will surely be one of the most successful habs in the outer system.' is the sales pitch that your muse was presented with as you first stepped onto Wilhab.

Diverse is certainly a word for it. One might say colorful. And loud. Very loud. Pervasive on the hab are a crab-like synthmorph the locals call Gons. Gons are made for gas mining, a route to citizenship and getting your own sleeve. All Wilke Mining asks is 1 year of 16 hours a week operating one of these in the mines, and you'll be provided with your own sleeve and whatever else you can make up in that time. Fully one fifth of the hab are Gons, and they are everywhere. They squeak, creak, clack, and groan as the pass, making when streets a very loud place to relax.

Most of the inhabitants are former or current miners. Many do just take the sleeve and run, but most don't have enough resources to get off after their stint. They may continue to work the mines, or make other arrangements..

Almost anything can be found at Wilhab, if you know where to look, and who to talk too. The HyperCorps even maintain a presence here, through Gorgon subsidiary called ProServe. ProServe provides the mine and it's employees with security, and from that becomes the de-facto police force for the hab. The officers run the gamut from green and polished to shadier than an oasis at noon. When on duty, the officers wear a very distinctive bright green uniform, complete with a bright green hat. Generally known as 'the mean green', most people do steer clear of them, if only on principle.

The station is laid out in a tube, as with most cylinder habs, the hab is only 10 km wide, but runs a very long distance, and is actually being made by nanobots, so it gets longer every day. Near the north end of the hab is where the miners are run out of. An airlock system allows workers access to the catacombs of metal buildings that make up the mining operations for Wilhab. Outside of this is housing for the Gons. As you head south, the center of the Wilke Mining bureaucracy and their upscale houses can be found. Further south still the neighborhoods become unpredictable, a slum might be walled from an upper class arm appreciation micro-commune. All manner of people have found a home at Wilhab.

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Okay. There's your infodump for the day. "

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "I'd like to see if I can get a solo with everyone scheduled in the next few weeks. SO think about what your character would be doing around Saturn. There's plenty of color herem p. 102 in the EP book lists what's found around here. Scum, micro-habs, etc. So you can be pretty free with your idea of where your character comes from."

> (OOC) Menocal is scum. :)

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "You can also come from Wilhab, if you like. But think about what your character is doing, and also why they would be interested in Firewall, or why Firewall would be itnerested in them."

> (OOC) Doc says, "I don't see how we could be interested in Firewall without hearing about them first, so how does this work? :)"

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Firewall is an speical ops organization pursuing what they claim to be humanities future. BUt they aren't above blackmailing people to get what they need."

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "In general Firewall would contact people whos services they seem to think they could use. Some people are in Firewall to help humanity past the hump, as it were. And in this case you may have heard a whisper of somethign and come seeking the org."

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Otherwise they might try and hold something over your head, withhold information, and flat out pay people off to participate."

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Make some sense?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "yeah"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "Oh yeah. I need to think some, but now that we know what's going on, it'll be cool."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Yes and no. Are you asking us to choose how we get involved with Firewall?"

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "If you've read The Culture novels, Firewall is kinda like Special Circumstances, only way less abobe-board."

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Yes. Or at least have an Idea how you would like your character to be involved. The method you chose will become what we do in your solo."

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "SO you come to me with 'Well Doc is bored and wants to help humanity' or 'Katja wouldn't ever help firewall except for for money' or whatever, and then We'll work this into a solo intro adventrue."

> (OOC) Katja says, "I'll take the easy way and assume it's just one off semester contracts."

> (OOC) Katja says, "One of my. x.x"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "I have curiosity as a motivation. I think that right there covers it all."

> (OOC) UntergangGM nods.

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "You have a little time. But I'd like ot know what it is, then I'll work on an intro adventure. for each of you."

> (OOC) Menocal says, "I'll work on stuff and ideas and things and how I smuggled my device on or if you prefer that I get rid of it okay cool."

> (OOC) Damon says, "I'll think more about it, but if I thought of nothing else, Kris could be working for ProServe waiting for his big break, and if Firewall offered him the possibility of more independence he'd jump at it. The offer wouldn't have to be genuine."

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "That sounds good. "

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "ANything else?"

> (OOC) UntergangGM says, "Sorry there's not more for tonight. I'll try and be on at nights to talk about things."

> (OOC) Menocal says, "yes, but I should ask privately so"

> (OOC) UntergangGM nods.
