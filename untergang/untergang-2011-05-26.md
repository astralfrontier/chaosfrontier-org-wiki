Firewall SITREP: Aboard the _Alexander Nevsky_, a SLOTV in deep space. One survivor in hypothermic hibernation, five active Firewall agents (four biomorphs, one infomorph). Long-term life support has been established. More to follow.

---

Working together, Doc, Menocal and Katja attain full control of the _Nevsky_'s computers. None of the previous crew are in any position to complain, and getting back to civilization takes priority over the niceties of property rights.

Katja has kept herself busy planning automated repairs to get as much of the ship functioning without compromising their ability to get to Saturn. In between repairs and harassing Remus over his nutritient glop, she's also been gathering information about possible upgrades that could be made once they get to civilization.

Menocal has been looking at the record she made for herself, trying to see if she can isolate some of the parts of the record that are virus significators, so then she has a pattern to use to go over the ship's datasystems and make sure there's no, uh, surprises waiting.

> (OOC) Katja says, "How do you whisper? Is it really different on here? o.o;"

> (OOC) Doc says, "wh name=message"

> (OOC) Doc says, "meanwhile..."

The ship's systems were badly damaged. Much of the nigh-infinite storage space and considerable processing power it had are gone; it's barely able to sustain half a dozen infomorphs or AGIs in its current condition. Still, what remains has been rebuilt from fragments, checked, and vetted.

As for upgrades - well, repairs must necessarily come first. Katja finds the master specifications in ship's memory. Once in spacedock, they can be made read/write, and self-healing systems can start to repair the wounded craft, or change it around to its occupants' liking.

> (OOC) Doc says, "k. Menocal: you've got more or less free run of the ship and the systems aboard. my default assumption is that people training for skills could use some simulspaces set up, and you're the best person to do that. if you prefer to pose through somethin else, do that now. either way, anything aside from virus checking that you want to do is available - you can't find anything remaining on board that looks hostile."

> (OOC) Menocal says, "If people tell me they want simulspaces I'll make them, and make sure they know I can, if they want."

> (OOC) Doc says, "the other PCs aren't here to speak up, but the players have made vague mention. Katja, if you have anything, mention it now"

> (OOC) Doc says, "you guys all have 10 Rez to spend, you can spend on skills if you want. doing so takes training time, so that's what this would be used for"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Yeah, I'd like to pick up some demolitions skills. I need to look at my sheet, though."

> (OOC) Doc says, "you have some time to do so"

> (OOC) Remus has connected.

> (OOC) Doc says, "you can also just pose training now, and actually spend the rez after you figure out what you want"

> (OOC) Remus almost ready

Katja mozies up to Menocal after getting a bit bored with scolling through scematics. "Do you have time to set up a simulspace for me? Something where I can learn the art of blowing stuff up a bit better?"

> (OOC) Menocal rolls 1d100 vs. 55 for 10 (exceptional success, MoS 45)

Menocal says, "Yes. Yes, I think I can do something with that..."

> (OOC) Menocal says, "that was my XP Production skill roll."

> (OOC) Doc says, "feel free to pose briefly how it comes out. :)"

> (OOC) Doc says, "as much of your experiences in this world will be virtual as physical, so this side matters too :)"

> (OOC) Menocal ...and so Katya spent time defusing bombs. Some of them talked. Some of them lied. ("I'm a thirty-second bomb! Twenty-nine! Twenty-eight! Twenty-seven! I lied!" \*boom!\* ) AT one point she had to chase a mad bomber who kept setting bombs to go off at midnight for some reason.

> (OOC) Katja says, "..."

> (OOC) Menocal says, "What's the no-prepend comment again?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "'spoof', 'sp' or '.' will all work"

> (OOC) Doc checks Remus

> (OOC) Menocal says, "the actual demolitions training is quite correct, based on my roll? It's just that it's also go weirdnesses to go with it, preparing Katya for work under odd situations."

> (OOC) Doc says, "the basic physics library comes standard; gluing pieces of world together in meaningful ways is the essence of your craft, not making sure that kinetic energy works properly."

Katja makes a note to herself to program 'I'm a Little Teapot' to blare into whatever room Menocal is in at random times for the next 24 hours.

> (OOC) Doc says, "aand one other brief contribution:"

Doc has also been busy. Since he has no need to stay in hibernation for the journey, and little interest in shutting himself off, he's been building a small virtual home in a corner of the ship's memory. He's chosen a relatively low-resolution skybox and an endless field of green grass, with slowly drifting clouds overhead. Still, it's more alive than a sterile starship. He comes out from time to time, as interested as Remus is in the state of the ship's more biological systems - and in particular, its remaining frozen passenger.

> (OOC) Damon has connected.

> (OOC) Doc says, "Damon. need any skill training? if so, Menocal's setting up surreal simulations, so describe your needs."

> (OOC) Doc says, "actually spending Rez can come later if you are still thinkin about it"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Skill training? Probably freefall combat. I'm not sure yet if I actually want to spend my Rez there, but I might."

> (OOC) Doc says, "you can go through the training now and opt not to spend if you like"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Sounds good."

> (OOC) Doc says, "feel free to pose then :)"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "him or me?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "either or both, really. whoever has something to contirbute to the effort"

> (OOC) Damon will go first

> (OOC) Menocal says, "k"

Mindful of the warning about preparing to fight the last war, Damon looks back on the post-awakening incident and decides that, all things considered, he's spent too much time fighting in a gravity field lately. Thus it is that, while Menocal is still putting the finishing touches on Katja's demolitions sim, he likewise approaches the artist about constructing a free-fall training sim for himself. Perhaps if he had looked over Menocal's shoulder while making this request, he might have had second thoughts.

Menocal designs a freefall combat sim for Damon. He gets to fight self-motile and inexplicably angry marshmallows with a variety of weapons in a zero-g environment. (Yes, perhaps you should consult a bit more with her. She is an eccentric artist, after all. On the other hand, for both of you, she runs the sims first, so at least she risks her own brain first before yours.)

> (OOC) Remus says, "This presumes that Damon and Katja aren't freaked out by anything that doesn't also freak out Menocal."

> (OOC) Menocal says, "well, yes."

Damon comes out of his training with three things. First, a greater appreciation for the distinction between weight and mass in the context of zero-gee maneuvers. Second, an inexplicable distate for s'mores. And finally, a question for the sim author: "Menocal... why is it that, when I started the sim, there was a booming voice yelling 'CHOOSE AND PERISH'?"

Menocal says, "It was in the marshmallow creature sim already."

> (OOC) Doc has more when you guys are done

Damon nods, somewhat dazedly, and walks away, seemingly unsatisfied by the answer, but resigned to the fact that it's all the answer he's going to get - or possibly, just all the answer he can stand.

> (OOC) Damon done

Katja exits the sim gasping for breath. Her pupils are dilated, and she looks like she's been running. "That, uh... Yeah. Ok. Thanks. I think I have a better appreciation for explosive systems built by the insane now." She walks off slowly in search of a cup of water.

> (OOC) Doc moves on!

Menocal looks at Remus. "Would you like one too?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "or not!"

Menocal smiiiiiiiiles.

> (OOC) Menocal says, "just offering."

Remus hangs in midair, trying not to look apalled. For someone specially trained in the art of lying, he's doing a bad job of it. "No thanks. I've got enough to keep me busy in reality."

> (OOC) Doc has more when ready

> (OOC) Remus says, "Fire"

---

What's keeping Remus busy is his 'patient' - the last subject in hibernation. And with Doc's help, it's becoming increasingly clear that the individual inside may not be capable of resuscitation even if the team wanted it to happen.

Remus uploads his findings into the public mesh. "He's trying to sabotage his own statis matrix... using a mental trick to turn the nanomachines against him. Put simply, he's trying to kill himself," Remus reports. "We can't thaw him out without difficulty. I'm beginning to think we shouldn't, if he's that determined to die, maybe he knows something about the Exsurgent virus that we don't want to know."

> (OOC) Remus Adds something

Remus sits in the biolab, surrounded by dozens of virtual projections of his patient. The central one is the least informative: an MRI of the man's face. Completely unidentifiable, until the radio is fixed. "I don't suppose anyone knows who this is. It would make a decision easier."

> (OOC) Doc poses through!

_Let me die,_ comes a voice in Remus' mind. It's not from his AR rig, he's confident. It's simply a voice, speaking through to his consciousness.

> (OOC) Remus says, "He's right /here/, Ray. He's /talking/ to me."

Remus pauses. He decides not to relay this new development to the team just yet; patient confidentiality buys just enough room in bioethics to keep a few secrets. _Are you sure? We don't have a backup for you here, much less a sleeve for it. Can you at least tell me why?_

_Firewall.. has backups. It's cold. I feel it.. it's too cold,_ the voice comes. _The infection still has me. But I know how to fight it. Don't want to.. I will take lack over this frozen hell._

> (OOC) Doc says, "for those who didn't catch on, hypothermic hibernation aka cryostasis is a controlled shutdown of the body through intense cold. everything, including brain function, is supposed to shut down."

"And now he's... asking to die," Remus says. "I can hear him. It shouldn't be possible. But I think we should oblige him, and quickly." _Alright. I'll do what I can. Is there anything you want to pass along?_ Remus works to keep the quaver out of his voice, but he's not sure he can keep it out of his mind. The Col-Am still keep euthenasia wrapped in a taboo.

_Operation.. successful.. we extracted you as infomorphs from Wilhab, fed you back into your sleeves before we realized what had happened.. you were.. corrupted. Something altered your egos._ The mental 'voice' is shaky. _You held out.. bravely. Don't regret your memory loss. Welcome to Firewall._

> (OOC) Damon says, "wat"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Yeah, I'm totally lost, too."

> (OOC) Menocal says, "we succeeded in our mission and don't remember it x.x"

> (OOC) Doc says, "exactly. more on that after we close, which is in a couple. Remus, what do you do?"

> (OOC) Remus says, ""

> (OOC) Remus says, "What else can I do? Shut him down before he goes bughouse and we're back to fighting the Borg."

> (OOC) Doc says, "pose accordingly then"

Remus feels a wave of vertigo. Whatever happened on Wilhab must have been horrible indeed, if it was worse than what's happened since. _We save who we can. Rest in peace._ He forces the ship to override the hibernation program, and wishes for a bottle of vodka.

Menocal comes up behind Remus quietly, slips a small flask onto the desk next to him, and walks off to let him deal with things in peace.

> (OOC) Doc will wait until people are ready once again?

> (OOC) Menocal says, "it's a small flask of Martian booze."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Anybody else think that going back to Wilhab might be a real bad idea?"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Duh."

> (OOC) Damon says, "Until we get some intel on what might've happened there."

> (OOC) Menocal says, "I think when we get to Saturn we look up how much is left of Wilhab"

> (OOC) Katja says, "And if we're on the police scanners."

> (OOC) Doc says, "on that note!"

Navigation is set in. The ship can't even make Wilhab in any reasonable time frame, but it can reach the trailing edge of Saturn's orbiting children - including a glorified tin can the ship's records identify as Borderland. Of note is the easy availability of hydrogen, which the ship's fuel tanks need. Travel further into Saturn's system will take reaction mass. And more importantly, the team can learn what happened on Wilhab from a safe remove before venturing back.

> (OOC) Doc says, "travel time is 3 months. full refuel is an Expensive (90,000 credit) cost, which isn't too daunting given the business plan Remus has discussed."

> (OOC) Doc says, "from the refueling station you guys can hit the Co Lam barges, Wilhab, or anywhere else."

> (OOC) Doc says, "anything else for tonight? closing poses"

> (OOC) Doc is wrapping early 'cause people seemed busy/tired/hungry etc.

> (OOC) Remus says, "Nothing that shouldn't wait until I'm more prepared."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Yeah, I don't really have much. Kat will probably spend most of that time going between engineering and the bridge, exercising, napping, and playing weird sim games with Menocal out of boredom."

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. Remember you guys can also just hibernate, take shifts, etc. to pass the time. A /60 simulspace experience will be the equivalent of 3 days or so."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Do we have a radio yet?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "not yet, work can proceed on trying to rig a new one though. it's unlikely to do much at this range - the destruction of long-range broadcast gear on the ship was \*quite\* deliberate."

> (OOC) Menocal will be making more simspaces if people want them.

> (OOC) Doc says, "alright. we'll cover that next time then :) Thanks to you guys for showin up despite bein tired/hungry/etc., and we'll have more substance next time."
