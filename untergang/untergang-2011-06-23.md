Firewall SITREP: a low-bandwidth radio antenna array has been worked in the engineering shop and attached to the ship's systems. Higher order transmissions are unavailable, but text and voice communication and basic mesh searches are ready. The _Alexander Nevsky_ is decelerating toward the Borderland station for repairs and refueling.

---

The wounded vessel turns on her axis. Within the heart of the ship's systems, the long-running navigation program engages the engines for the first of several controlled burns. Metallic hydrogen, held at high compression with magnetic fields, fights its way out into cold cold space. Three gravities of deceleration take hold of the ship and its occupants. Moments of heavy thrust, a pain that reaches down to the bones and marrow, then silence and weightlessness again.

The _Nevsky_ is now quite literally falling toward a tiny tin can in space, called Borderland. This, the outermost station in the Saturn trojans, was still far enough away to put the ship's fuel reserves at risk. But Borderland is the last link in the "Red River", a hydrogen-mining operation around Saturn. This station must certainly have hydrogen. Whether they will sell it is another matter.

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay, go ahead"

Menocal has been constructing some sims to pass time. After the reaction to the previous ones, however, she hasn't asked anyone to test them for her.

> (OOC) Doc says, "if Katja is doing anything to pass the time, let me know. if you're in hibernation instead, let me know :)"

Katja has been spending her times learning the ship. Every system that she's been able to access has been noted, so that repair and upgrade plans can be made. She's been making lists of parts in order of importance, and also jotting down who might be able to help aquire them if the station proves to be difficult.

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. Unless you have a strong objection to talking to these guys, your radio work will be bearing fruit. want that to go ahead?"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Sounds good."

The problem with a radio antenna isn't simply finding a piece of metal and slapping into a lathe. Modern radio traffic is guided by antennae designed by nanotechnology and adapted in place thanks to their smart-matter composition. The sheer density of information exchange makes such advances necessary. But a low-bandwidth directional array is possible, as long as the protocols for driving it are also known to the ship's comm system. Are they? They are.

With the installation of this low-tech array, the ship's comms proceed to negotiate a time-division duplexing scheme with Borderland's radio array. Some level of communication is available, and the station now knows that the crippled craft is approaching. Basic data about Borderland starts coming in; seven sleeved individuals, and twenty-three infomorphs, make up the crew complement. Administration is handled by two parties. One is called Mickey Sullivan; the other is identified as "Everybody Else".

> (OOC) Doc says, "If you guys have messages or queries you want to run, this is a good time. Bandwidth is extremely low, though."

> (OOC) Remus has connected.

> (OOC) Doc says, "plz to be catching up on scrollback."

Katja checks for any personal messages that may be waiting for her. She also sends a an inquery to the station asking about repair facility functionality, and any alerts for the area.

> (OOC) Katja says, "Here's a question. Who is listed on the manifest as the owner of the vessel? If we make port somewhere, is it something that is going to raise a red flag?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "the officially registered owner is a small hypercorp. if you dug into the ship's records (and you didn't have any others to go by), you'll find that this is a Firewall front company. So, you don't anticipate any problem."

The messages that come back, mediated by software agents on the mesh, are chopped down to their bare minimum for Katja's currently-advertised low bandwidth condition. Thus, messages from her friends asking about where she is and what she's been doing come through fine; pictures and vidclips, recommendations for mesh sites and the like, are all filtered. There'll be more catching up to do once the _Nevsky_ gets back to civilization.

> (OOC) Remus says, "First thing I'd do, is zap off a proposal to the powers that be at Col-Am about banking sleeves."

Borderland's system advertises "craft in need" emergency repair services at a standard rate, but nothing else - certainly not the extensive refit the _Nevsky_ will require. The ad comes with a postscript: "For all other services, see the proprietor." Perhaps face-to-face negotiations will be necessary.

> (OOC) Remus says, "Also, who is Mickey Sullivan? That he's as important as 'everybody else'?"

Requesting more information about the station sends back text summaries, along with some relatively low-resolution bitmaps.

Mickey Sullivan is a large, heavy-set man with ginger hair and a broad grin. He looks so quintessentially Irish that one wonders how long it took him to engineer the appearance. His partner, presumably "Everybody Else", is a standard mass-produced synthmorph shell: two glowing eyes, no mouth or other facial features, and a vaguely simian cast. The shell's skin is entirely covered with glowing, non-animated two-dimensional artwork and other graffiti.

Menocal says, "Hm." And she starts to construct a quick sim of the ship's damage, to send up to Borderland so they have some idea what's coming in. Nothing fancy, just data they can use in standard rendering software to get an idea how bad things are."

> (OOC) Damon has connected.

> (OOC) Doc says, "Damon, plz to be reading backscroll"

> (OOC) Katja says, "I'm not so sure sending them that data is a good idea as far as negotiation is concerned. This guy would have an advantage if he knew how much we really need. Could jack up prices. .\_.;"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "I said I was building it; I didn't say I was senidng it right away. You can, you know, tell me that in game."

> (OOC) Damon , caught up.

> (OOC) Katja says, "Sorry. x.x"

> (OOC) Doc says, "alright then. Yeah, you guys can talk about your strategy ICly."

> (OOC) Doc says, "I want to impress upon you guys. Out here, law is not a certainty. Anarchists are not nice and friendly people; they're just people who think that government is in the way of them doing what they want to do. The hypercorps are not particularly altruistic sorts. Proceed cautiously."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Well, with only seven people..."

Remus reviews what little data has downloaded from Borderland. "Only thirty people total. Only seven even sleeved. The place is tiny, even by isolate standards. Can we trust them?"

Katja stretches. "This place is too small to get anything on the cheap. Reports look like it's got one big boss, and everyone else just tries to get by. Let's have a backup plan to run if they pull anything shaddy. And no, I wouldn't trust anyone."

Katja says, "I think we should just get fuel and what we need to get to the next station without burning out. Damn. I was hoping to at least get a beer.""

Menocal says, "I could write you a bar UX. :)"

Damon pipes up. "We're almost out of fuel, and we can't go anywhere else if we don't get it from Borderland. I don't know about you, but the only 'backup plan' I can think of is piracy."

Menocal says, "We should not rule that out completely, but it should be a Plan E or worse."

Remus raises an eyebrow, Spocklike. "Isn't it a bit early for us to be contemplating that option?"

Katja says, "This isn't civilization, Remus. People out here do what they need to do to get by. Keep that in mind when someone eventually shoves a gun in your face and demands your cred."

"Frankly, I'm against it because I don't know what we're up against," says Damon. "They _will_ have defenses against pirates. And if they're in the habit of taking advantage of people like us, they'll have offenses too." He flexes his right hand. "I don't usually like to say it this way, but... violence needs to be our last resort."

"Well," Remus replies. "Then we should be asking - what do we have, that they'd consider worth screwing us over to get it?" He ticks off on his fingers. "One banged-up ship with empty tanks. But they have fuel, so that's not a problem for them. A bunch of sleeves - currently occupied, by us. And either the goodwill of our allies, or their enmity."

Menocal says, "Good. I'm bad at it."

Katja says, "Menocal, can you help me set up some remote overrides in case we dock and have to, uh, repossess our property?"

> (OOC) Remus suggests swapping those

Menocal says, "Sure!"

"I shall stay on mesh monitoring," offers Doc, who has been patiently listening until now. "No ship will fly without the right codes, unless they wish to tear out the whole computer."

Katja laughs. "I hope this goes smooth as a good vodka. I'm just antsy, because out here? There's nowhere to run.

> (OOC) Doc says, "alright. you guys have a designated negotiator, and a plan?"

> (OOC) Katja says, "I vote for Remus to use his silver tongue. o.o"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "seconded"

> (OOC) Remus says, "That's what I'm here for."

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. and the plan?"

> (OOC) Katja says, "I guess my suggestion of a plan is: 1. Dock. 2. Negotiate fuel/repairs. 3. Monitor progress. 4. Get as decent a meal as this place can offer."

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. fuel isn't free - I think Remus is lining up the scheme to pay for it, though."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Yeah, I was wondering how we were going to pay for anything. I don't like the idea of laboring for 10 years to pay for a tank of fuel. z.z"

> (OOC) Doc says, "Remus gonna run with that, or does one of you have a rich uncle?"

> (OOC) Katja says, "The only thing Kat can do is offer her engineering services to get a discount."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Well, who do these guys bank with? What constitutes hard currency these days?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "a note on that then."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Because what I'm basically offering is to arrange a contract to sell sleeves somewhere else, get a line of credit based on that contract, and then use the credit to pay these guys."

A quick review of the station's information gives Remus some information. Borderland is nominally owned and managed by the Red River Construction Consortium - a hypercorp that does deep-dive gas mining through Saturn, and one of dozens of such corps that do so. The Wilke Gas Mining Group is another.

Out this far, one credit is still one credit, and hypercorp economics theoretically apply; in reality, the new economy matters just as much. Raw materials, and skills to work them, are regularly bartered in lieu of actual cash. A credit chain extending from Red River to the Col-Am seems feasible to Remus.

> (OOC) Remus comments

"That's what we'll do, then," Remus says. "My people will underwrite the cost of the fuel from Red River to us, backed by some sleeve futures. We better just make sure that the contract to sell gets filled, or my superiors will hold me personally responsible for the loss."

> (OOC) Remus adds

Remus adds, "As long as Borderland is willing to take their parent corp's word for the line of credit, we shouldn't have any problems here. Still, let's not take any chances. Doc will keep them from taking the _Nevsky_, all we'll have to do is watch our own skins."

Katja says, "Anyone need basic supplies? I can probably barter services for small stuff."

> (OOC) Doc says, "doesn't sound like it. we ready to go?"

Remus says, "I have a feeling that we'll be better able to assess that in person. I'm sure we can convince them that we have something they need. Even if they don't know it yet."

Katja transfers the equipment list to Remus. It's broken down into two small sections: IMMEDIATE NEED and SECONDARY NEED.

> (OOC) Katja says, "Good to go."

> (OOC) Doc says, "okay. anyone else? if not, proceeding."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Go ahead"

> (OOC) Doc says, "alright:"

---

The _Nevsky_ executes a few more controlled decelerations. Each one is based on a fresh sighting of the habitat, correcting for optical distortions and unanticipated movement. By the time the final burn completes, the ship is within a few miles of Borderland. Attitude thrusters will handle the rest, but a good pilot would wince: less than 0.1 mps of delta-V is left in the tanks.

At this range, the surviving automech has a more powerful radio than much else on board, and it takes over as the link to Borderland. The available bandwidth is much improved. And the ship receives an invitation to video chat from Mickey Sullivan and Everybody Else.

> (OOC) Doc says, "while Remus is figuring out what to say.. Damon, plz roll Profession: security ops. Menocal, Infosec."

> (OOC) Menocal rolls 1d100 vs. 65 for 95 (failure, MoF 30)

> (OOC) Damon rolls #help for 0 (0)

> (OOC) Menocal says, "Aiya o.o"

> (OOC) Doc says, "'roll on <my skill level>', Damon. e.g. 'roll on 80'"

> (OOC) Damon rolls 1d100 vs. 70 for 66 (critical success!)

Remus takes the call from the Nevsky's biolab. Col-Am negotiation procedure suggests adding natural elements to the environment as a kind of status symbol; the algae-based bioreactors are the closest thing aboard. Still, they are living things, and that's something out here. Remus runs quickly through introductions and presents the deal: Borderland provides as much of a refit as they can out here. Col-Am will underwrite the cost with sleeve futures in a short time frame. Remus doesn't go into detail about how the _Nevsky_ got shot to hell; Firewall business is Firewall's business, and he doesn't want a bunch of isolate miners thinking that they're carrying an exsurgent 'curse'.

> (OOC) Remus should amend that so 'curse' is in 'quotes'.

> (OOC) Menocal says, "....nn. using moxie to reverse that to 59, so it's at least a success x.x"

The two heads of Borderland listen to Remus' presentation patiently, politely. And on a side display, Remus can see the signs - a deep laser and high-resolution radar scan is being done of the _Nevsky_. Doc and Menocal, in turn, see that their software safeguards are being tested. "Pirates, eh?" asks Sullivan finally, all asmile. "Well no matter, you got away with yer lives. Sure an' we can supply you with the hydrogen ya need. You'll just be pardonin' us if we consult with the higher-ups on this." He clicks off for a moment, leaving Everybody Else. "It is good to see you again," remarks the synth.

Remus substitutes a faint grin for signs of surprise. "And you. So we've met, then?"

"Oh yes," the synth answers. "We enjoy your company quite often. Tell me.. your crew are all biomorphs, are they not?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Oh hell."

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 for 95

> (OOC) Remus says, "These guys might know the previous owners. Who we spaced, except for the guy on ice, who is now very dead. And might assume that /we/ are the pirates."

> (OOC) Damon has no idea whether we even /should/ try to hide Doc.

> (OOC) Remus says, "Well. Diplomat's rule #1: When in doubt, lie like a sack of shit."

> (OOC) Remus replies

"I think so," Remus replies. "Most of us didn't make it." He deliberately recalls a moment of fear from the previous encounter: one of the infested crew punching the nanofactured hatch to this very lab, and that hatch _deforming_. The fear shapes his face to communicate a moment of authenticity. "The mesh is pretty torn up, and without communications, nobody's going to be egocasting in."

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 vs. 60 for 22 (critical success!)

"We understand completely." Everybody Else is an unreadable mask. "You have had many trials in your life. We always enjoy hearing about them." With that, Sullivan snaps back to life on the display.

> (OOC) Remus says, "EE is either a schizophrenic or a transcendant spiritual guru."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Either way it's creepy."

"Sure as we're willing to extend you poor unfortunate souls a helping Christian hand," the Irishman explains. "We've got a work detail we could send aboard to examine the damage. I'm confident we'll be able to get you shipshape. What say ye?"

> (OOC) Doc messed up a bit, edits EE's dialogue.

> (OOC) Doc says, "at this point the ship and the hab are a mile distant if that. They could just EVA some guys over."

> (OOC) Remus says, "What's our EVA capability?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "you all have spacesuits. you can navigate in space for a bit."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Should it become necessary to ditch this can and go knocking on their door."

> (OOC) Remus says, "What kind of face is Damon making when he hears this?"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Well, right now, I'm thinking 'what do we need with a repair crew? Why can't we just get enough fuel to get us to a larger hab?'"

> (OOC) Katja says, "What kind of dangers does space hold to synthmorphs?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "none. Synths can freely operate in vacuum"

> (OOC) Damon does some OOC posting.

> (OOC) Damon er, IC

> (OOC) Menocal says, "having better communications would be good, I think, and a good look just to make sure we're not going to tear ourselves apart halfway to somewhere would be good."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Can't we just explain that we have an engineer and already have a list of what we need? Save some time so we can just dock?"

"We were rather hoping to dock," Remus says. "Let me poll the others." Remus keeps a straight faces as he taps out a message on a keypad. _He's stalling. He wants badly to get aboard. Don't know why. Maybe old crew were his friends and he's concerned. Do we let him?_

Damon sketches on his own keypad. _Do we even need repairs right now? I thought that what we needed most now was fuel._

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 for 29

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 for 16

> (OOC) Doc rolls 1d100 for 42

Menocal adds her own: _we could use a communications system repair, I think._

Katja taptaps. _I don't like the idea of being borded. Comm system is pretty important, but that doesn't require a whole crew._

Katja taps some more. _On the other hand, he could be as paranoid of us as we are of him._

> (OOC) Katja says, "Random question. Can synthmorphs be magnetized?"

Remus types again. _At most five of them. Could we take them in a brawl?_

> (OOC) Doc says, "they have metal bodies and some of it can be made magnetic. I'd have to know more about your idea to tell you"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Ultimately it's Damon's specialty."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Unless he says otherwise, I'm inclined to let them board."

> (OOC) Damon says, "Intuitively, as the player, I'm not liking odds of 5 vs. 2. Menocal has openly stated that her combat specialty is running away, and Remus hasn't made any claim to be a skilled combatant."

> (OOC) Katja says, "I was wondering how hard it would be to set up a single room to act as an electromagnet strong enough to immobilize the synthmorphs for a few moments. It obviously wouldn't be a permanent solution, but if they turn on us, at least them not being able to dodge is more of an advantage than we've got right now."

> (OOC) Doc says, "you could rig it with time. you've only seen one synth in their crew so far (Everybody Else)."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Well, judging by how psychotic she seems... Hmm."

_Straight-up brawl? Not if they're all A&D,_ replies Damon. _If you don't mind being a decoy, we can set up ambush._

> (OOC) Damon says, "Damon's pretty confident in his abilities, but I don't think he's /that/ confident. Yet."

_Sounds fine_ Remus replies. _After all, the worst they can do is kill me._

> (OOC) Remus says, "So we let them on?"

> (OOC) Katja says, "I'm not sure we have a choice."

> (OOC) Katja says, "What kind of time are we talking about for my magnetron idea? Minutes or hours?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "with the automech helping you, minutes."

Katja types. _I've got an idea that might slow them down if we have trouble on board. Best we can do._

> (OOC) Damon says, "What should I roll for setting up our turf to maximum combat advantage for ourselves? Katja's idea is one example, but there's bound to be other things a good military guy should think of."

> (OOC) Doc says, "security ops"

> (OOC) Damon rolls secops (again), then.

> (OOC) Katja says, "Well, meeting them in a room with cover in case of a firefight would be nice. :D"

> (OOC) Doc says, "you sort of already did, but yeah :)"

> (OOC) Damon says, "If my earlier secops roll covers it, it was a critical success. Am I missing any tricks?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "roll once more for shits & giggles"

> (OOC) Damon rolls 1d100 vs. 70 for 60 (success, MoS 10)

> (OOC) Doc goes for a pose here:

> (OOC) Damon will save his moxie in case the shooting starts.

During his time aboard, Damon has found the _Nevsky_ to be somewhat ungainly in design. Most SLOTVs are built for convenience, fast boarding, ease of cargo management and so forth - after all, time is money. But in planning for what's to come, he's realized what the Firewall agents who built the ship actually did.

Airlocks, port and starboard - but one set fore, one aft. Attackers must either split their forces to get both upper decks, or they have to go a deck at a time. The access corridors on the middle and upper decks aren't aligned, so you can't just blast your way through. Emergency thrust would send people sprawling aft if they took the corridors, while the normal workspaces are well equipped for safety. The whole ship was designed for defensibility.

The big weakness right now is the gaping hole in the starboard access corridor - from there it's only a few yards to the power plant and the crew hibernation area. Consequently Damon has sealed off access as best he could.

> (OOC) Remus was going to reply to Mickey, but this may affect Damon's vote.

The airlocks are kill zones. The middle deck's attackers face people stationed up the stairs and in the central access corridor. The upper deck's airlocks channel people into a narrow access hallway. Either route is defensible; it's just a matter of picking one.

> (OOC) Doc says, "go ahead"

"All right," Remus replies to Mickey. "You can't refuel us with an e/v, but I can understanding wanting to see for yourself. Come on over."

"We'll steer you close enough," promises Mickey. "Sendin' out my team."

---

> (OOC) Remus says, "So how we gonna set up for them? c-c It sounds like we've got a defense plan and it's only a question of how much hostility we want to assume."

The Firewall agents watch as a squad exits Borderland's airlock. As their ship draws to within a few dozen yards of the station, two spacesuited figures and a dozen robots jet their way across the starry void. All are carrying heavy kits of some kind.

> (OOC) Doc says, "My assumption is that you are setting up in case they are hostile, yes"

> (OOC) Menocal says, "yes"

The crew has been properly paranoid. As the Borderlands crew approach, t-ray scans bouncing off the kits reveal the characteristic outline of weapons.

> (OOC) Remus says, "Oh hell."

Some of the robots split off from the main force, angling to breach the ship via the gash in the starboard side hull.

Katja says, "Lock and load."

> (OOC) Doc says, "how do you want to proceed?"

Remus tries to hail Borderland again. "Hey! This isn't part of the deal!"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Katja, where do you have your magnetron ambush set up?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "Well, assuming that I was waiting at the airlock as bait... get away from the fucking airlock. o\_o"

Mickey's face comes to life on the display. "Just think of it as... a steep discount on fuel," he grins.

> (OOC) Katja says, "We never got to discuss that. x.x"

> (OOC) Doc says, "I wil assume that you and Damon collaborated to find the best spot"

> (OOC) Doc says, "and as it happens, that's.. more or less where they are headed :D"

Remus scowls. "If you really did know the regular crew, then you know who they work for. And you can probably guess how we got emp'd. Think about it, you jackass."

From the _Nevsky_'s radio emissions, Borderland must have guessed at the location of their power plant. Taking that out cripples the rest of the ship. But Damon and Katja saw that much coming. And they had three months to plan.

> (OOC) Damon says, "I assume we'll concentrate our forces (read: Katja and myself) in position to defend from the hole in the hull?"

The robots find themselves immobilized. All those exposed conduits and all that loose wiring were hooked into a magnetron. The two spacesuited individuals, and two robots, are coming through the port and starboard airlocks.

> (OOC) Doc says, "how do you want to deal with them?"

> (OOC) Remus says, "I suggest gunboat diplomacy."

"Regular crew? Never met you before," Mickey demurs. "We're just havin' ourselves a little fun. Don't give up quietly."

> (OOC) Damon says, "They'll be cautious, making use of what little cover they may have. We can see them coming. If the robots coming in the out-of-spec entrance are secured for now, let's spring the ambush on the rest."

Katja says, "I find your lack of faith disturbing, Mickey."

Damon grins ferally as he listens to the conversation on the mesh. He may have said 'last resort', but by custom and temperament, violence is his last, first, and only resort, and silently he thanks Mickey for being so cooperative. Damon slaps an AP magazine into his submachine gun and gestures to Katja to prepare for attack.

Remus cuts the link. "I think it's time for us to happen to someone."

Katja loads RAP rifle ammo and grins. She's not happy it turned out this way, but hell if she isn't going to enjoy visiting a bit of destruction on these bastards.

> (OOC) Doc says, "aaand we will see what happens next week! any volunteers to close?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "what we have here will work fine, if not"

> (OOC) Damon says, "I have this."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Here's a little plan I've been workin' on, how about we shoot her first?"

> (OOC) Katja says, "I am slightly disapponted that I didn't get to shoot anything yet, but this looks like a fun firefight. And forgive my use of the word 'magnetron'. I actually didn't intend to cook us. It's just an electromagnet. XD"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Shoot who first?"

> (OOC) Doc.

The enemy may outnumber - and possibly outgun - the _Nevsky_'s crew... but Firewall has the home-court advantage. Damon and Katja can stand still, whereas the enemy must move - through hallways whose cameras are under Doc's control. Damon watches the local feed, and listens with a trained ear, until the enemy is as far from cover as possible. No need for complex battle gesture language here; all he needs is his finger count. Three... two... one...
