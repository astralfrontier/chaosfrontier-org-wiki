Firewall SITREP: investigation suggests that ID Crew may be actively trying to provoke cargo carriers into opening their storage cubes and releasing infections of some kind.

Firewall Response to Wilhab team: Proxy being assigned for this investigation.

---

In the wake of the latest of Doc's reports, compiling what the team knows, a proxy - a Firewall representative, handler, or agent - is being assigned. She makes herself known via private messages addressed to the team on Kronos, and goes by the alias "Aunt Sophie". Within an hour, the _Nevsky_'s computer registers receipt of a beta fork of an individual by this name, and the fork requests a team-wide pow-wow.

> (OOC) Doc says, "unless someone doesn't want to talk, I assume you're all in. So you've got a handler now, you can talk to her about what you want to do or ask questions if need be."

> (OOC) Doc says, "by way of introduction, then:"

> (OOC) Remus says, "This should be interesting."

Aunt Sophie's beta presents the appearance of an old spinster, dressed in conservative - for the day - clothing, and chain-smoking. Even as an infomorph, some habits never die. "Alright. This sounds like serious business. I read your reports," she announces over the team's tacnet. "Whaddaya wanna do about it?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "feel free to summarize ICly what you just mentioned"

> (OOC) Damon will pose in a bit.

"We have several options," Remus begins. "We can try some B&E against the ID Crew. Or we can go back and see what else the poker players know. Also, it's not my favorite, but we can take the matter to the Kronos Port Authority and tell them that they may have an exsurgent outbreak waiting to happen here - which may or may not be true. I can't see the ID Crew letting that can of worms loose in their own backyard. Too disruptive of their distribution network."

"I'd been watching the Vine, to see if I could follow anyone unloading additional cubes, maybe find someplace for others to infiltrate," Remus continues. "Unfortunately, I haven't seen anything so far."

> (OOC) Remus Done

"About that distribution network," interjects Damon. "Where from is it coming? Kronos is not the source of the cubes, it is, how do you say, a laundromat. Cubes are coming from somewhere, being sent to the places like Borderland, and then they are being sent to Kronos. We are not solved until we find the _source_."

> (OOC) Damon says, "More"

Damon thinks for a moment. "But for the now," he continues, "it may be useful if we can learn why they are being accumulated here. Is it just for sending along to elsewhere, or are they planning to make something of it? Another Wilhab, maybe?"

Katja says, "If there is only one source. Who's to say that it isn't a large scale operation similar to Firewall's structure of autonomus cells?"

Aunt Sophie chews on her cigarette for a few moments. "Yer Katja got her hands on some infomorphs, that the chimp said came from the cubes, yeah?" she asks finally. "How about inspectin' their memories? See if you can read anything useful from there."

> (OOC) Doc swaps those around.

Menocal frowns, thinking. "We also should try to obtain one of the cubes, for the purposes of research. That may give us ideas on the source, as well as how to safely neutralize these if, say, the Sun or a nice off-ecliptic push is not available or advisable."

> (OOC) Remus says, "I can't believe I forgot that she actually picked up some of those egos as lewt."

Katja nods. "I'll take a look at those cards.

"Alright." Aunt Sophie rubs her hands together. "I'll get a trace runnin' on feeds from other ports, send out the word to your fellow sentinels, all that proxy bullshit you guys are too busy to do. If there's other cubes in the system, we'll find 'em. And if I find a Help Wanted ad for haulin', I'll forward that as well. Alright?"

"You think we might be able to pick up another one ourselves?" Remus asks. "I suppose that makes sense. As long as it doesn't get us killed again. Even those -" he points at Katja's 'cards' - "make me nervous."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Oh, one other thing"

"Also..." Remus says slowly. "Can we get a back-channel to the KPA? A sympathetic ear that won't bring a hail of bullets our way?"

"I'll put out the word. I can't promise anythin', you understand." Aunt Sophie exhales a mathematically perfect smoke ring. "But I'll see who knows what. They're Ultimates, after all, so y'might get a friend of a friend of a friend type thing. Check back with me in, uh, twenty hours."

Katja says, "Uh, Menocal? Do I need a sandbox to look at these properly."

> (OOC) Damon says, "..."

> (OOC) Damon says, "Damon isn't an expert in infomorph security, but OOCly, may I suggest a text-only channel? Give our infomorphs a comfortable and secure prison - physically distinct from our ship systems and maybe not even on the mesh - and communicate via text."

Doc chips in at this point - this is his specialty, after all. "You needn't risk running the infomorph as such. We can perform appropriate neural pruning to block the infomorphs from taking action. Think of it as inducing a comatose state, while we perform a memory examination. That should mitigate the risk."

Katja says, "Sounds good."

> (OOC) Doc says, "alright. so you have a couple courses of action. what first/"

"Spiffy," Remus murmurs appreciatively. "If Doc did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him."

> (OOC) Remus says, "How long will it take to see what's in the cards?"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Well, we have the infomorphs /here/. Anything else involves legwork, which will be greatly expedited by having some idea where our legs - virtual or otherwise - should take us."

> (OOC) Doc says, "not long. it's an NPC doing most of the rolls for you, which I've already figured out"

> (OOC) Katja says, "The cards seem to be a good starting point, then."

---

Firewall publishes safety protocols for dealing with Exsurgent infections. At minimum, protocol calls for the physical ejection of a computer into space, with operations to be handled there by delta forks. The process will be monitored remotely and the computing substrate destroyed. If nothing looked amiss, it's repeated with beta forks, and the betas' experiences are edited back into the principal investigator's own ego.

Doc has no interest in deviating from the advice of the experts on this. Accordingly, he gets Katja's help in fabricating a small space-worthy computer - little more than a locked-down ecto - from open-source specs, and slots a copy of one of the cards into its memory.

Doc's delta performs the procedure. No unusual emanations are detected from the spaced ecto. Accordingly, it's destroyed and a second one launched. Following the end of the investigative procedure, Doc's beta verbally relays information back. And finally, Doc summarizes his findings.

"The card contains a woman, a wife and mother from the Jovian Republic. This in itself is unusual. She, her family, and dozens of other people were contacted by some sort of political or resistance movement, and offered 'escape' from the Jovians. They sold their biomorphs as the price of passage to elsewhere in the system, and submitted themselves to ego uploading."

> (OOC) Remus says, "This does not bode well."

Doc continues. "She was brought online twice. Once after the initial upload, and again during the trip. Based on this, I believe that I can start to chart the path she and her family took. It will take time to run the image search over the mesh, however."

"Think we should talk to her?" Remus asks.

Katja says, "Is that going to be dangerous at all? I hope that nothing is sniffing for that kind of search."

"If they are, it is your poker buddies, Katja", says Damon. "Whoever is behind this, they can not possibly be sniffing for all of the billions of people they stole."

Katja says, "Well, I do owe them a few repairs. I can get started on those and see if I can get any info out of the crew."

Remus shrugs. "I guess it's worth asking. After all, the poker players know we have a card, and they're going to expect us to analyze it. They've got no reason to suspect we're anything but another bunch of space bums so far."

> (OOC) Remus says, "But this has nothing to do with old-Earth data. She's from Jupiter."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Yeah. but nobody cares about the Jovians, so if you want people to release the infomorphs, what would YOU tell them?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "This is also only one card, so who knows."

> (OOC) Doc says, "Want to go for one more?"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Sure."

> (OOC) Doc says, "alright. Mike and Pat!"

> (OOC) Damon says, "what"

Discussion ensues. And Doc preps another card for inspection.

---

> (OOC) Doc says, "few minutes of break while we read up on old stuff :)"

> (OOC) Katja says, "Oh, that comes back into play?"

> (OOC) Remus must idle for a bit. Hopefully the world won't end while he's away.

> (OOC) Doc says, "nope, go ahead"

> (OOC) Doc says, "anyway, you two let me know when you're caught up on that"

> (OOC) Damon is as caught up as he's gonna be.

> (OOC) Katja says, "I'm caught up."

> (OOC) Menocal is caught up

At Ohyama High School, circa 2010, Minami manages to track down Kyoko and Touji. The last time they talked was the nurse's office. "I have a favor to ask," the girl explains, when they meet on the roof. "This man who says he's my real dad. He wants to meet, at a restaurant. Will you two come with me? Just in case?"

> (OOC) Remus uh

> (OOC) Doc says, "Phil and Geoff can hang back. This is for Pat & Mike"

> (OOC) Menocal has some popcorn

Kyoko glances at Touji. She shrugs, letting him know that she has no plans. "Sure, Minami. It's safer for you not to go alone." She nudges Touji to answer.

Touji shrugs, then glances at Kyoko and nods. All things considered, it'll be safer for Minami if she has friends around. Not just because of this strange man, but because of the Ohyama rumor mill - there are a lot less interesting rumors to be had in all three of them going together.

Dinner, then, is duly arranged. Minami texts the date and time to her bodyguards. They show up early, enjoying a pair of sodas, with a plan typical of high school. By Minami's request, they'll 'accidentally' notice her, then sit down and join the group. If Minami's 'father' isn't a complete cad, he'll accept the imposition with grace.

They see Minami arrive, see her sit down at the table where a man in a suit has been waiting patiently.

> (OOC) Doc says, "and assuming they approach... feel free to do the 'hey schoolmate, nice to see you, may we sit' business. :)"

Kyoko raises her hand to wave energetically at Minami. She shifts her drink to the other hand and grabs Touji's arm. "Look over there, Touji, it's Minami!" She starts walking toward the girl.

Touji does his usual pained but patient smile that he usually wears while tagging along with Kyoko's adventures. As they approach the table, he offers a stiff little wave. "Hi, Minami. You doing okay?"

> (OOC) Damon fixes

The man looks up abruptly. Minami smiles, with evident relief. "What a surprise, you guys!" She turns to the man in the suit. "Um, Sonoda-san, these are friends from school." Introductions are exchanged. This is Kenji Sonoda, who says he works as a computer programmer.

Kyoko bows when introduced to the man. "It's nice to meet you. Are we interrupting? I was wondering if we might be able to join you. It's been so long since we're seen eachother." She smiles brightly, turning up her charm.

Sonoda looks carefully at the pair. "Actually, yes, this concerns you two as well. Please, sit down."

> (OOC) Damon says, "Sure, sitting down."

When the pair have their seats, he continues. "I told Minami that I was her father. It's more correct to say, honestly, that her father isn't real, and I am. You two are the same. You were orphaned, but your parents aren't really dead. They were simply.. removed from this world, you might say."

Touji, as usual, doesn't have much patience for apparent foolishness. "What the heck are you talking about?" he says quizzically.

Sonoda looks very serious. If he's playing a joke on the children, he's not giving off any sort of humorous atmosphere. "This world is a lie, meant to keep you sane while you're on your journey. One by one, people are being evacuated to safety. This capsule will fall out of its orbit soon. We have only so much radio bandwidth available. Many will probably die."

Kyoko peers at the man as if he were speaking in another language. "Mister, you sound like a sci-fi manga. Have you been watching too much Dr. Who? Have you been taking your meds?"

"Now, Kyoko, let's let the nice man finish talking," says Touji, then turns to him again. "Seriously, though, sir, is this going to start making sense soon?"

"It is not necessary that you understand," Sonoda responds curtly. "Only that you consider my offer. I want to evacuate the women and children first. Call me old-fashioned or romantic, but I have always believed that the future of our country lies with the young, and with the wives, mothers and young women. This means you three would qualify."

Turning to Touji, Kyoko gives him a baffled look. "He's talking like it's WW2 and he's trying to selectively evacuate us. It makes no sense."

Touji turns to Kyoko. "It makes sense to me," he grins, still not really taking it seriously. "He's offering to send us on one of your adventures! We're going to be evacuated from, uh, whatever it is we need rescued from, and sent away!" He pauses. "So... what's this capsule, then? Maybe it'll make more sense if you explain that bit."

> (OOC) Damon says, "I see no capsule here."

Sonoda stares. "For centuries, philosophers didn't believe in the existence of the atmosphere, something they could neither see nor taste nor touch. They recognized the wind, but not the presence of the medium. Your world is a simulated existence, mediated by computer. You see, think, taste, and experience by virtue of this computer. From inside it, you would never know otherwise."

Minami hasn't said much. Her expression is wavering between disbelief and comical dismissal. But it's clear that if this goes on much further, she's going to have another breakdown.

Touji's brow furrows. "Okaaaaay. Well, it's an explanation, I'll give you that. I'll certainly never be able to disprove it. So... how does this 'evacuation' of yours work?"

"The mind is removed by the capsule controller, and broadcast by radio to another receiver." Sonoda pauses, taking a drink from his coffee cup. "But radio broadcasts can only go so quickly, and are unreliable. It is slow. Painfully slow."

Kyoko frowns at the man, not finding it nearly as amusing as Touji. Thoughts of government experimentation and freak shows fly through her head from all of the manga she has read over the years. "But if we don't actually feel anything, then what does it matter how fast or slow it is?"

"Not to you. To everyone behind you, waiting to escape the same way you are." Sonoda sighs. "The capsule will burn up once it re-enters Earth's atmosphere. Once that happens, their chance is gone."

> (OOC) Doc says, "assuming you guys are silent and not just writing Tolstoy here..."

Kyoko huffs, not very happy with the answer. "Well, what do you need from us to do this?"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Took the words out of my mouth."

The man folds his hands together. "It is happening already. What I wish is your permission to evacuate you three. Soon. I can make no promises about what you will find where you're going. If you stay here, death is certain, but you will never know it came for you. You must choose to be pioneers of one unexplored frontier... or another. Which shall it be?"

Kyoko leans against the table. "Then what happens to us? We magically disappear from this world?"

"You'll take a train. As far as anyone else knows, that is the last anyone sees of you." Sonoda reaches for a pocket, extracting three train tickets and sliding them across the table. Although this was supposed to be a surprise visit by Kyoko and Touji, unnervingly the children can see that each ticket is wrapped with a slip of paper. Their full names are carefully printed on each slip.

Touji glances at Kyoko. "They're one step ahead of us, whoever they are." He frowns. "So either you're a stalker, and you're stalking _all three_ of us... or you're telling the truth."

Sonoda lets out a sigh, and pulls out another strip of paper. Printed downward on it, in bold strokes, is a message. It reads: I am not a stalker, and I am telling the truth.

> (OOC) Damon says, "Okay, now he's just showing off."

"We cannot take overt action. Your minds will destabilize if confronted with obvious impossibilities. But we can skirt the boundaries of what you will accept," the man explains tiredly. "Please. You must decide soon."

Touji stares at the new slip of paper for a long moment. Finally, he sighs, and looks sideways at Kyoko. "Well... looks like we get an adventure after all. Is it quite what you thought it'd be?"

Kyoko shrugs. "Whatever. This is all crazy. Maybe it's just a dream. If we stick together it won't be that bad...right?" She looks at Touji for a moment, wondering if he would be able to protect her from crazed army men with machine guns.

> (OOC) Doc says, "gonna go for it then?"

> (OOC) Damon says, "Sure. With reassurances for Minami if she needs them."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Only out of concern for the others. Why they aren't paranoid I do not understand."

Doc is very quiet when he returns from the next dive. "I think we have found your Earth refugees," he says. "It is a risk, but I think if I extract more information from this, we will have a definite line on the source."

> (OOC) Doc says, "back to normal!"

"Risk to them," Remus asks, "or risk to humanity?"

"Risk to us, and by extension the rest of humanity," admits Doc. "If something leaks out. But the infomorph on this card was an amazingly old one. Second-generation, if the experiences I analyzed are any indication. At one time quantum holography was used to store egos, rather than a purely digital container."

"That's not relevant to this, of course, haha," the scientist laughs. "I'm just enjoying this for personal reasons. So I ask for concensus, that my interest does not override caution."

"I'm not familiar with the technology," Remus states. "Does that make it easier or harder to hide a hostile transcendant entity?"

Doc shrugs. "Neither, really. I'm just very keen to investigate such a relic. It is of interest to me as an infomorph, you see."

Remus shrugs. "If there's a chance that we've got a piece of old Earth, maybe it's worth the risk. My fleet's spent most of the time since, coming back from the Oort Cloud. They wouldn't want me to pass this up."

Damon scratches his head. "Well, that's the lure, is it not? The point, it would seem, is that our data thieves took egos from wherever they found them."

Aunt Sophie's beta fork takes the opportunity to chime in. "Now that y'all are back and payin' attention, good news. Found more cubes. They're all being shipped to Kronos. Looks like you lot are at Ground Zero for whatever's happening."

Katja says, "Awesome."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Oh hell."

Remus says, "If they're all coming here, then a little detective work should figure out where they go when they get here."

"There's more." The proxy's newsfeed is channeled to the team's own HUDs. "We got lucky. At someone else's expense, sure. Another ship tried to open their pandora's box and disappeared. Thing is, I had a guy I know point a telescope along their path. We found the wreck. You can go take a peek if you're feeling suicidal."

"I do not know if we have time," says Damon. "I have an unpleasant feeling about so many cubes in this one place, and more coming in. This cannot continue forever, because there is only so much Kronos to put them in. So when there are enough cubes, they will do something, and then very bad things will happen. Perhaps they open them all at once."

> (OOC) Doc says, "So yeah, you have a couple definite avenues now: investigate the cubes coming in, which you can anticipate - you have shipping details and everything; investigate the wreck. We'll figure out what you want to do next time?"

"Can we send a surrogate out to the wreck?" Remus asks. "Maybe a remotely-operated vehicle, without enough brains to subvert?"

"We absolutely can," Doc answers cheerfully. "I can prep a space probe and fabricate it from ship's stores."

Katja says, "Let's send the synthmorph."

> (OOC) Remus says, "Yeah, next time."

> (OOC) Doc says, "alright. any closing comments?"

> (OOC) Damon says, "None from me."

> (OOC) Katja says, "Nope."

> (OOC) Doc says, "and now you guys know where that side story came from."

> (OOC) Doc says, "but where is it going?"

> (OOC) Doc says, "alright, thanks for coming :)"
